  This study aims to clarify the concept of overstay coups, focusing on power extensions by incumbent leaders. By distinguishing overstay coups from the broader, more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or autocoups, which encompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research introduces a refined understanding of these specific political events.

  The research involves coding overstay coup events and compiling a comprehensive dataset covering the period from 1945 to the present. Using this dataset, two detailed case studies provide qualitative insights into the dynamics and outcomes of overstay coups. Additionally, a regression analysis identifies the determinants of overstay coup attempts, shedding light on the factors that influence incumbents' decisions to extend their power illegitimately.

  The findings contribute to the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework and empirical evidence on overstay coups. This research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by incumbent leaders, and it examines the implications for democratic resilience, democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, personalization of power, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this study inform policy and theoretical discussions on political stability and the challenges facing contemporary democracies.

## Introduction

The study of irregular power transitions, encompassing both irregular entries and
exits from office, has long been a central topic in political science. However,
one form of irregular power transition - the incumbent leader's refusal to
relinquish power - remains relatively understudied. This scenario, where leaders
overstay their mandated term limits for one or more terms, or even indefinitely,
lacks a universally accepted term in the existing literature. To address this
gap, this study adopts the term "autocoup" to denote this phenomenon.

Coups, being the primary form of irregular power transitions, have received
significant scholarly attention. Research by @goemans2009 indicate that coups
account for a substantial portion of such transitions, with roughly two-thirds
(65.8%) of 374 irregular exits occurring through coups. Additionally, @frantz2016
demonstrate that coups are the most common form of exit in autocracies,
surpassing regular transitions by a third.

However, while coups were once frequent, recent decades have witnessed a decline
in their occurrence [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. Conversely, autocoups appear to be
on the rise, particularly since the Cold War's end [@ginsburg2010evasion;
@baturo2014; @versteeg2020law]. Despite the significant political impact and
rising prevalence of autocoups, their study lags behind that of classical coups,
which are extensively documented due to their historical frequency [@thyne2019].

This research aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the understudied phenomenon
of autocoups as they are at least equally important and warrant comprehensive
analysis. Firstly, autocoups are typically accompanied by a disregard for the
rule of law, weakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or
authoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful
autocoups increase the risk of future irregular power transitions. Research
indicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who overstayed
their term limits through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either
ousted or assassinated while in office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed autocoups
often trigger instability that fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.

Despite their significance, autocoups are understudied compared to traditional
coups. Although several relevant concepts and terminologies such as self-coups,
autocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay,
and continuismo have been proposed and discussed [@marsteintredet2019;
@baturo2022], there is no clear and widely accepted term to describe these
events. Different terms are often used interchangeably or inconsistently, leading
to confusion. Moreover, due to the lack of clear concepts, the collection of
autocoup datasets is still in its early stages compared to the rich datasets of
traditional coups. Hence, the limited existing studies on autocoups have
primarily relied on case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022],
with few focusing on quantitative analyses.

To fully understand irregular political leadership transitions and survival, we
need to redefine and clarify the term "autocoup" first. Based on a clear
definition, we can introduce an autocoup dataset that can be used for further
empirical analysis. This study aims to address these knowledge gap surrounding
autocoups and contribute in three areas. First, it clarifies the terminology by
defining autocoups based mainly on power extension. Second, it introduces a new
dataset of autocoups since 1945 based on this refined definition. Finally, the
research utilizes this dataset for a quantitative analysis of the factors that
influence leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups.

The subsequent section, based on a comprehensive review of the definitions of
power expansions and power extensions, proposes a precise definition of
autocoups. This will be followed by an introduction to the new autocoup dataset
in Part III. In Parts IV and V, I will explain the determinants of autocoup
attempts through two case studies and demonstrate how the novel autocoup dataset
collected in this study can be used in empirical analysis. Finally, I will
conclude in Part VI, summarizing the key insights gained from the study and
suggesting avenues for future research.

## Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions

Compared to coups, which are clearly defined and widely accepted as illegal
attempts by elites within the ruling group to overthrow the leadership
[@powell2011], the concept of autocoups (also known as self-coups or autogolpes)
suffers from a lack of consistency and clarity. This ambiguity hinders our
understanding and study of a critical phenomenon in irregular power transitions.
To address this gap, we need to tackle two key issues: terminology and
definition.

### Terminology

The most common term in autocoup literature is self-coup, or autogolpe in Spanish
[@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017; @marsteintredet2019].
This term gained academic prominence after Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree
in 1992 [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 point out,
the term "self-coup" can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself,
which is inaccurate since it is not self-directed but targets other state
institutions or apparatus.

Another approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use terms with
adjectives or modifiers, such as presidential coup, executive coup,
constitutional coup, electoral coup, judicial coup, slow-motion coup, soft coup,
and parliamentary coup [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms can be helpful in
specific contexts, their proliferation often adds to the overall confusion rather
than providing clarification. Most of these terms focus on the specific methods
used by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify the perpetrator,
necessitating further explanation. In fact, many of these methods could be
employed either by or against executive leaders.

A third alternative involves terms like "incumbent takeover" or "overstay".
Incumbent takeover referrs to "an event perpetuated by a ruling executive that
significantly reduces the formal and/or informal constraints on his/her power"
[@baturo2022, p.374], based on earlier research [@svolik2014]. While overstay is
defined as "staying longer than the maximum term as it stood when the candidate
originally came in office” [@ginsburg2011evasion, p.1844]. These terms identify
the perpetrator (the incumbent) and/or the nature of the event
(overstaying/extending power). However, they do not highlight the illegality or
illegitimacy of these actions. Therefore, they cannot serve as a direct
counterpart to "coup," which clearly denotes the illegality of leadership
ousters, while "takeover" or "overstay" diminish the severity.

Therefore, this study strongly advocates for "autocoup" as the most accurate and
appropriate term. It avoids the pitfalls of other terms by clearly conveying the
essence of the phenomenon as a coup-like power grab and effectively
distinguishing autocoups from classical coups by highlighting the perpetrator.

### Definition

While terminology is important, another issue arises with the previous definition
of autocoups: should we emphasize power expansion or power extension? Power
Expansion refers to situations where an executive branch expands its power beyond
its original boundaries, often by encroaching on the authority of other branches
like the legislature or judiciary. Power Extension, on the other hand, refers to
situations where a leader extends their tenure in office beyond the originally
mandated term limits. Existing definitions of self-coup or autocoup sometimes
touch upon power extensions, but they primarily focus on power expansions, which
has several drawbacks.

Firstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align
well with the definition of a coup. When we define a classical coup, the focus is
clearly on the ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or
restriction on their power. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition
of an autocoup should prioritize the extension of executive leadership. We would
not classify an event as a coup if a vice president seizes some power from the
president, as long as the president remains in office. Similarly, an executive
leader acquiring more power from other branches should not automatically qualify
as an autocoup if their term limits remain unchanged.

Secondly, emphasizing power expansion raises issues regarding the purpose of
launching an autocoup. As @cameron1998a defined, a self-coup is "a temporary
suspension of the constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who
rules by decree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to
ratify a political system with broader executive power" [@cameron1998a, p.220].
However, without extending their time in office, the leader faces significant
risks once their term expires, as they could face legal or political
repercussions for the autocoup itself, leaving behind an overly powerful
executive branch for the successor. Although the term "self-coup" gained
prominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which initially involved seizing
power from other institutions, it is important to note that Fujimori ultimately
extended his term limits through constitutional amendments. The 1993 Constitution
allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, which he won with popularity in April
1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress
passed a law of "authentic interpretation" which effectively allowed him to run
for another term in 2000, which he won amid suspicions and rumors. However, he
did not survive the third term. In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human
rights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took refuge in Japan [@ezrow2019].

Thirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be
challenging. Power expansion might occur as a sudden, significant event, as seen
with Fujimori in 1992, or it could be gradual and incremental, as in the case of
Putin since assuming power in 1999 [@chaisty2019]. In the latter case, it is
unclear whether each step should be considered an autocoup or if the entire
process together should be labelled as such. If the latter, determining the point
at which it becomes an autocoup is again problematic.

Therefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should
prioritize power extension as the core characteristic.

In light of this discussion, we formally define an autocoup as *the practice of
current political leaders extending their time in office beyond their originally
mandated term limits*. Two key points need to be highlighted. Firstly, this
definition does not exclude power expansion, but its primary characteristic is
extending the term in office. Secondly, the essence of an autocoup is
illegitimate, although it often employs seemingly legal mechanisms, which will be
discussed in more detail in Chapter III.
