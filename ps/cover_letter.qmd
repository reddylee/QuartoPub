### Dear \[Editor’s Name / Editorial Team\],

I am pleased to submit my manuscript entitled **“Power Dynamics and Autocoup
Attempts”** for consideration by *\[Journal Name\]*. This study addresses a
significant gap in the literature on irregular leadership transitions by
examining the political and institutional determinants of autocoup attempts—an
increasingly salient phenomenon in contemporary governance.

While the literature on classical coups is well developed, autocoups remain
underexplored despite their rising frequency and profound implications for
democratic erosion. Drawing on an original global dataset covering 83 autocoup
events from 1945 to 2023, this article introduces a refined conceptualisation of
autocoups and employs a bias-reduced logistic regression model to evaluate the
role of regime type in shaping their occurrence. The findings demonstrate that
personalist autocracies and presidential democracies are particularly susceptible
to such attempts, due to their structurally concentrated executive authority.

In addition to contributing novel empirical insights, the article offers a
conceptual bridge between research on irregular ousters and tenure extensions,
helping to systematise our understanding of leadership continuity beyond
constitutional limits.

The manuscript is approximately 5700 words in length, including references and
tables. It is original work, has not been published elsewhere, and is not under
consideration by another journal.

Thank you for considering this submission. I would welcome the opportunity to
contribute to your journal and look forward to your response. Please do not
hesitate to contact me should any further information be required.

Yours sincerely,

**Dr Zhu Qi**
