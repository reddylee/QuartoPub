## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This thesis addresses a notable lacuna in the study of irregular leadership
transitions by systematically incorporating autocoups—instances wherein incumbent
leaders extend their constitutionally mandated terms through extra-constitutional
means. It refines the conceptual definition of autocoups by resolving prevailing
ambiguities, thereby aligning them more closely with conventional coup
frameworks. On the basis of this refined definition, the thesis introduces a
novel global dataset of autocoup events spanning the period from 1945 to 2023,
comprising 83 documented cases, 64 of which were successful.

Utilising this dataset, the study conducts a large-N empirical analysis to
examine the structural determinants of autocoups. The findings indicate that most
power-centred regimes–presidential democracies and personalist regimes–are
significantly more susceptible to employing autocoups as a strategy for power
retention, in contrast to other regime types. This pattern diverges from that of
traditional coups, which have historically been more prevalent in military
regimes.

The analysis then shifts to the question of leadership survival, employing
survival analysis techniques to compare the political longevity of leaders who
assumed office via traditional coups with those who retained power through
autocoups. Contrary to the hypothesis that autocoup leaders survive longer than
their coup-installed counterparts, the results reveal that—once very short-lived
leaderships (less than 180 days) are excluded—the method of power acquisition
does not exert a statistically significant effect on leadership duration.
Instead, regime type emerges once again as the critical determinant: military
regimes exhibit a significantly higher hazard ratio for leadership removal
compared to the reference category of dominant-party regimes, mirroring trends
observed in classic coups.

The thesis also assesses the broader institutional ramifications of such
irregular power transitions, particularly with respect to democratisation. Using
Polity scores as a proxy for democratic quality and applying a country-fixed
effects model, the analysis demonstrates that autocoups are associated with a
sustained erosion of democratic institutions both preceding and following their
occurrence. In contrast, while traditional coups often precipitate an immediate
and sharp decline in democratic quality, they are frequently followed by
democratic recovery or transitions over time. These findings highlight the
divergent political trajectories engendered by coups and autocoups and call for
greater scholarly and policy attention to the consistently negative consequences
of autocoups for democratic governance.

Taken together, the findings underscore the distinct nature, drivers, and
consequences of coups and autocoups. This research makes several substantive
contributions: it clarifies the conceptual boundaries of autocoups; provides a
new empirical basis for their systematic study; and offers robust comparative
insights into how different modes of irregular power transition influence both
leadership survival and institutional development. The implications are
substantial for academic scholarship and policy-making alike, particularly in the
context of global democratic backsliding and the resilience of political
institutions.

## Introduction

At the heart of contemporary political dynamics lies a fundamental question: why
are some political leaders prematurely removed from office, while others succeed
in extending their tenure beyond constitutionally mandated limits? Furthermore,
how does the mode of their survival or removal shape political stability and
democratic institutions? This thesis seeks to address these critical questions by
analysing the structural and strategic foundations of irregular leadership
transitions.

### Motivations

The stability and resilience of political systems depend crucially on the orderly
transfer of power. When leadership transitions occur within established
institutional frameworks, they reinforce political legitimacy and contribute to
regime durability. In contrast, the breakdown of conventional mechanisms for
political succession often precipitates instability, violence, and democratic
backsliding. Among the most disruptive of such breakdowns are irregular
leadership transitions, which leave lasting institutional legacies and
fundamentally alter the political trajectory of regimes. Understanding the causes
and consequences of these events remains central to the study of political order
and regime change.

The extant literature identifies a broad array of catalysts for irregular
leadership exits, including civil wars [@kokkonen2019], international conflict
[@demesquita1995], ethnic divisions [@londregan1995], economic crises
[@miller2012; @krishnarajan2019], and natural disasters [@quirozflores2012].
Among these, coups d’état are particularly consequential due to both their
frequency and their direct displacement of incumbent leaders. In autocratic
regimes, coups account for nearly one-third of all leadership exits—exceeding
regular transitions, which constitute just over one-fifth [@frantz2016].
Furthermore, over 63% of non-constitutional removals in dictatorships are
attributable to coups [@svolik2009].

Consequently, coups have received extensive scholarly attention. A substantial
body of research explores their causes, outcomes, and long-term implications for
democracy and development [@thyne2019]. In particular, the study of coup
determinants has flourished, with scholars proposing nearly one hundred
explanatory variables. Yet, a widely accepted baseline model remains elusive
[@gassebner2016].

By contrast, another form of irregular power transition—the autocoup—has received
comparatively limited academic scrutiny. In an autocoup, an incumbent extends
their tenure by circumventing or overriding constitutional term limits through
extra-constitutional means. While autocoups do not immediately result in
leadership change, they constitute a fundamental breach of institutional
succession norms and obstruct the expected regular transfer of power. As such,
they warrant classification as a critical, albeit understudied, variant of
irregular leadership transition.

This thesis argues that autocoups deserve systematic analysis alongside
traditional coups within a unified analytical framework. Despite differences in
execution, both coups and autocoups involve extra-constitutional efforts to
acquire or retain power, and both have significant implications for leadership
survival, regime stability, and democratic integrity. Comparative analysis of
these two forms of irregular transition can reveal shared drivers, divergent
outcomes, and broader lessons for democratic resilience.

The urgency of this inquiry is underscored by the serious risks associated with
irregular transitions. Both coups and autocoups may trigger immediate
crises—ranging from institutional paralysis to civil unrest—and leave deep
institutional scars. More fundamentally, they tend to dismantle constitutional
checks and balances, undermine electoral processes, and accelerate democratic
decline or authoritarian consolidation.

Historical cases illustrate these dangers vividly. Ghana’s turbulent era from
1979 to 1984 reflects the destabilising effects of classic coups. Following Jerry
Rawlings’s 1979 coup, eight individuals, including three former heads of state,
were executed [@pieterse1982]. Rawlings launched another coup in 1981 and
subsequently quashed three further coup attempts [@haynes2022d]. In contrast, the
1992 autocoup in Peru, orchestrated by President Alberto Fujimori, exemplifies
how an incumbent can dismantle democratic institutions without a change in
leadership. Fujimori dissolved Congress, suspended the constitution, and ruled by
decree [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998].

These patterns are increasingly salient in today’s global political landscape.
According to Freedom House’s Freedom in the World 2024 report, global political
rights and civil liberties declined for the eighteenth consecutive year in 2023,
with setbacks recorded in 52 countries and improvements in only 21
[@freedomhouse2024freedom]. The persistence of democratic erosion highlights the
pressing need to understand the mechanisms that facilitate it—including both
coups and autocoups.

This thesis seeks to advance both theoretical and empirical understanding of
irregular leadership transitions. It offers insights with substantial
implications for scholarly research and policy formulation in fragile or
democratising regimes.

### Research objectives and contributions

In response to the pressing challenges posed by irregular leadership transitions,
this study undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis structured around four
core research objectives. First, it seeks to refine the conceptual definition of
autocoups and introduce a novel dataset amenable to large-N empirical analysis.
Second, it aims to identify the structural and institutional determinants of
autocoups through a systematic quantitative investigation. Third, it compares the
survival prospects of leaders who ascend to power via traditional coups with
those who extend their tenure through autocoups. Finally, it assesses the
divergent impacts of coups and autocoups on democratisation trajectories and the
resilience of political institutions.

By examining both coups and autocoups from 1950 to 2023, this thesis addresses a
significant gap in political science by developing and applying a unified
analytical framework that treats these events as distinct yet interrelated forms
of extra-constitutional power transition. Through this lens, the study makes four
principal contributions to the literature on leadership dynamics, regime
stability, and institutional development.

#### Conceptual clarification and empirical foundation for autocoups {.unnumbered}

This thesis advances conceptual clarity by situating autocoups within the broader
typology of irregular power transitions. It offers a refined definition of
autocoups—centred on the executive's unilateral extension of tenure—and clearly
differentiates them from both executive aggrandisement and traditional military
coups. Building upon this conceptual framework, the study introduces an original
dataset of autocoups spanning the period from 1945 to 2023, documenting 83
incidents, of which 64 were successful. This dataset addresses a long-standing
empirical lacuna and provides a foundational basis for systematic comparative
analysis, thereby enabling future research into a previously under-examined form
of institutional disruption.

#### First emipirical analysis of determinants of autocoups {.unnumbered}

Utilising this newly compiled dataset, the thesis undertakes the first empirical
examination of the structural and institutional conditions under which autocoups
are likely to occur. The analysis finds that leaders operating within
power-concentrated systems—particularly presidential democracies and personalist
regimes—are significantly more prone to extending their tenure through autocoups
than those operating in other regime types. These findings contribute to the
literature on the relationship between regime characteristics and irregular power
retention, highlighting the critical role of institutional structures in shaping
leaders' strategic decisions to override term limits.

#### Comparative analysis of leadership longevity: Coup vs autocoup leaders {.unnumbered}

The research further contributes to the study of leadership survival by comparing
the tenure durations of leaders who attain power through coups with those who
retain it via autocoups. Employing survival analysis on both the coup and
autocoup datasets, the study finds that, contrary to the assumption, the method
of power acquisition is not a significant predictor of leadership longevity.
However, it reaffirms that regime type plays a decisive role in leader survival,
irrespective of the mode of accession or retention. The survival models indicate
that leaders within military regimes exhibit a higher hazard ratio of removal
compared to those in dominant-party regimes. These results underscore the
influence of regime structure on leadership durability and elite turnover.

#### Comparative democratic implications of coups and autocoups {.unnumbered}

The thesis also investigates the differential impacts of coups and autocoups on
democratic development. Employing country-fixed effects regression models and
utilising Polity V scores as an indicator of democratic quality, the analysis
finds that autocoups are consistently associated with gradual and sustained
democratic erosion—both preceding and following the event. In contrast, coups
yield more heterogeneous institutional outcomes. While they often result in
immediate setbacks to democratic norms, in certain instances they facilitate
democratic transitions, including shifts from autocracy to democracy. This
disaggregated analysis reveals the distinct trajectories and institutional
consequences engendered by different forms of irregular power transitions.

### Policy implications

Although scholarly debate persists regarding the potential for coups to
inadvertently foster democratisation under certain conditions [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016], there exists a strong policy consensus that
coups constitute inherently illegitimate mechanisms of political change. As
violent disruptions of constitutional order, they tend to inflict immediate
institutional damage, precipitate instability, and lead to unpredictable
political trajectories. Accordingly, both international and domestic policy
responses have rightly prioritised prevention—most notably through
“coup-proofing” strategies designed to insulate regimes from military
intervention or elite defection [@quinlivan1999; @pilster2012; @powell;
@albrecht2014; @carey2015; @brown2015; @sudduth2017]. However, as this thesis
demonstrates, such approaches have well-documented limitations [@albrecht2014a;
@reiter2020], and deeper structural power dynamics within regimes are frequently
more decisive in determining vulnerability to both coups and autocoups.

From this vantage point, the findings of the study generate several important
policy implications.

The first, and most immediate, implication concerns the design and architecture
of political institutions. Regimes characterised by robust horizontal
accountability mechanisms—such as independent legislatures, judiciaries, and
oversight bodies—demonstrate greater resilience to irregular power seizures. A
carefully calibrated balance of power reduces both the opportunity and the
incentive for executive actors to override constitutional constraints.
Institutional designs that disperse authority, limit executive aggrandisement,
and embed strong checks and balances may therefore serve as the primary bulwark
against both coups and autocoups. Promoting sound governance practices—through
the enforcement of constitutional term limits, the strengthening of civil
society, and the institutionalisation of transparent succession procedures—is
essential to mitigating the risk of authoritarian entrenchment.

A second major policy implication concerns the role of external actors and
international institutions. Regional and global organisations—including MERCOSUR,
the Organization of American States (OAS), the African Union (AU), ECOWAS, the
European Union, and the Council of Europe—have played a significant role in
deterring unconstitutional leadership changes. By establishing legal frameworks
that uphold democratic governance and deploying instruments such as sanctions,
diplomatic isolation, and suspension of membership, these bodies can exert
meaningful pressure on regimes that come to power via military coups or other
overt breaches of constitutional norms [@wobig2014; @shannon2014; @thyne2017].

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these mechanisms is often more limited in the
context of autocoups. Unlike traditional coups, autocoups are typically executed
through procedural manipulation—such as emergency decrees, rigged referenda, or
constitutional amendments—rather than overt displays of force. This legalistic
façade complicates international responses: the absence of visible violence or
abrupt leadership change often leads to delayed or inadequate intervention,
hampered by political ambiguity and the absence of consensus.

Given the rising incidence of autocoups since the early 2000s and their central
role in contemporary democratic backsliding [@bermeo2016; @mechkova2017],
international actors must adapt their monitoring and response frameworks
accordingly. A third and urgent policy recommendation thus emerges: regional and
international organisations must shift from reactive to proactive modes of
engagement, developing criteria that capture gradual institutional erosion—a
defining feature of modern authoritarian consolidation. Rather than awaiting
clear-cut disruptions, policymakers should utilise existing democratic monitoring
instruments—such as Polity scores, Freedom House ratings, and V-Dem indices—to
track sustained declines in institutional quality, media freedom, judicial
independence, and electoral competitiveness. Observable patterns of democratic
regression should be treated as early warning indicators, prompting calibrated
responses such as diplomatic engagement, conditional aid adjustments, public
condemnation, or targeted sanctions. Such measures would enable the international
community to act before constitutional frameworks are irreparably degraded.

In sum, this thesis underscores the evolving nature of threats to democratic
governance. While coups remain a visible and disruptive threat to political
order, autocoups represent a more insidious form of democratic erosion—one that
proceeds incrementally and often under the guise of legality. To safeguard
constitutional rule in an era marked by creeping authoritarianism, both domestic
institutions and international mechanisms must be reconfigured to detect and
counteract the gradual unraveling of democratic norms, not merely their sudden
collapse.

### Limitations and future research

Whilst this study proposes a novel analytical framework for understanding coups
and autocoups, their effects on leadership survival, and their broader
institutional implications, several limitations remain, indicating important
directions for future research and refinement.

First, although the definition and classification of autocoups advanced herein
represent a meaningful conceptual contribution, broader scholarly consensus on
these parameters remains underdeveloped. The definitional boundaries and the
empirical dataset introduced in this study serve as foundational contributions;
nonetheless, they are necessarily preliminary. Future research should seek to
further elaborate and refine these components to enhance the reliability,
validity, and comparability of findings across different analytical contexts.

A core challenge concerns the conceptual ambiguity that surrounds the very
definition of autocoups—particularly in borderline cases where incumbents extend
their authority through legal or quasi-legal mechanisms. Future work might
explore the normative and analytical trade-offs involved in including such cases
within the autocoup category. Comparative analyses of ‘unconstitutional’ versus
‘extra-constitutional’ extensions of executive tenure may assist in clarifying
whether these actions constitute variants of the same phenomenon or represent
analytically distinct processes.

This ambiguity in conceptual boundaries directly affects the construction of
empirical datasets. Minor alterations in inclusion criteria may lead to
substantial variation in the number and classification of identified cases,
particularly where intentions, timing, and legal interpretations are contested. A
case in point is that of President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras in 2009. Zelaya
proposed a referendum to amend the 1965 Constitution, which prohibited
presidential re-election, ostensibly to allow future leaders to seek an
additional term. As the referendum was scheduled for the same day as the national
election, its immediate passage would not have benefited Zelaya directly.
Nevertheless, questions persist regarding his underlying intent: by promoting a
reform that appeared not to advantage him personally, Zelaya may have sought to
cultivate public support for a subsequent reinterpretation or further amendment
aimed at extending his own rule. Ultimately, he was removed by a military coup,
precipitating a severe constitutional crisis [@muñoz-portillo2019]. This case
illustrates the analytical complexity of identifying autocoups and underscores
the necessity of refining coding criteria and interpretive clarity in future data
collection efforts.

Accordingly, both the conceptual framework and empirical foundation developed in
this study would benefit from sustained theoretical debate and methodological
refinement. Several promising avenues for future inquiry emerge.

Given the long-term decline in traditional coups and the parallel rise of
autocoups, increased scholarly attention to the latter is imperative. While this
study focuses on tenure extension as the defining feature of autocoups, broader
forms of executive power expansion—whether within or beyond the formal
constitutional framework—merit systematic investigation. These dynamics are both
frequent and damaging to institutional resilience, yet remain comparatively
under-explored in the literature on regime change and executive aggrandisement.
To capture the full range of such practices, the development of a dedicated
dataset on executive power expansion represents a crucial next step.

Moreover, the decreasing frequency of overt and dramatic regime transitions since
the early 2000s has coincided with a decline in unambiguous shifts between
democracy and autocracy. This trend highlights the necessity of more sensitive
instruments capable of detecting incremental changes within regimes. Future
empirical research should focus on identifying and measuring such subtler
transformations, including minor but sustained variations in Polity scores or
other disaggregated institutional indicators. By doing so, scholars will be
better equipped to monitor the gradual erosion—or potential recovery—of
democratic governance in contexts where abrupt regime change is no longer the
dominant mode of political transformation.

### Overview of the thesis

This thesis examines the complex power dynamics underlying coups and autocoups,
with a particular focus on their consequences for leadership survival and the
democratisation or authoritarian transformation of political regimes. It develops
a unified analytical framework to study these phenomena as distinct yet
interconnected forms of irregular power transition. Each chapter contributes to
this overarching inquiry by offering conceptual clarifications, empirical
innovations, and comparative insights.

#### Chapter 2: Conceptualising autocoups and data introduction {.unnumbered}

Despite the increasing incidence of autocoups—particularly in the post-Cold War
era—their systematic study remains underdeveloped. Existing scholarship suffers
from conceptual fragmentation, characterised by a proliferation of overlapping
and inconsistently defined terms (‘self-coup’, autogolpe, ‘executive
aggrandisement’, etc.) [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This conceptual
ambiguity complicates empirical analysis, as many datasets fail to distinguish
between tenure extension and other forms of executive power consolidation—an
essential distinction for this study. As a result, methodological progress has
been hindered, with most existing research relying on qualitative case studies
[@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], rather than large-N analyses.

This chapter addresses these limitations by proposing a more precise and
theoretically grounded definition of the autocoup. It contends that autocoups
should be defined as attempts by incumbents to extend their constitutionally
mandated terms of office. By centring the definition on tenure extension, the
concept excludes broader forms of executive aggrandisement that occur within
existing constitutional time-frames, and aligns autocoups conceptually with
classic coups, both of which involve disruptions to constitutionally prescribed
leadership succession. Accordingly, this study defines **an autocoup as the
extension of an incumbent leader’s tenure beyond its original constitutional
limit, achieved through extra-constitutional means**.

Based on this refined definition, the chapter presents a significant empirical
contribution: a newly compiled global dataset of autocoups spanning the period
1945 to 2023, identifying 83 distinct events, of which 64 were successful. This
dataset facilitates systematic quantitative analysis and opens new avenues for
comparative research on irregular retention of power.

#### Chapter 3: Determinants of autocoup attempts {.unnumbered}

Due to long-standing conceptual and empirical constraints, existing discussions
of autocoups have relied largely on case-based approaches [@baturo;
@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. The dataset introduced in Chapter 2 enables,
for the first time, a large-N analysis of the structural conditions underpinning
autocoup attempts.

Drawing upon insights from the coup literature, this chapter investigates a range
of potential predictors—including economic performance, succession rules,
military influence, protest activity, and media freedom. While these variables
have been analysed in the context of traditional coups, they often fail to
account for persistent cross-regime variation or the limited efficacy of
so-called ‘coup-proofing’ strategies [@albrecht2014a; @reiter2020]. Moreover,
many studies adopt overly simplistic regime typologies (e.g. democracy vs.
autocracy, or civilian vs. military), thereby obscuring important variation
within regime types [@hiroi2013; @schiel2019].

This chapter advances the argument that autocoup risk is shaped fundamentally by
the structural balance of power embedded in a regime’s founding configuration.
Specifically, the likelihood of an autocoup is determined by the equilibrium
between incumbents and potential institutional challengers—a balance largely set
at regime inception [@geddes2014]. To test this proposition, regime typologies
are employed as proxies for internal power structures.

Using both a standard logit model and a bias-reduced logit model (Firth’s
penalised maximum likelihood estimation), the analysis reveals that presidential
democracies and personalist regimes are significantly more prone to autocoup
attempts than dominant-party regimes, when other variables are held constant.
Leaders in dominant-party and military regimes, by contrast, do not significantly
differ in their likelihood of attempting an autocoup. These findings underscore
the centrality of regime type in shaping elite incentives for irregular tenure
extension.

#### Chapter 4: Power acquisition methods and leadership survival {.unnumbered}

Although a substantial body of literature has explored the tenure survival of
leaders who come to power through coups [@gandhi2007; @sudduth2017; @easton2018],
the absence of comparable data on autocoups has long precluded systematic
comparisons between coup-installed leaders and those who prolong their rule via
autocoups. This chapter addresses that gap by offering the first comparative
survival analysis of these two categories within a unified theoretical framework.

It argues that coup leaders typically face heightened legitimacy deficits,
political uncertainty, and institutional instability, whereas autocoup leaders
benefit from institutional continuity while simultaneously removing key
constraints. These distinct conditions shape divergent pathways to political
consolidation.

Surprisingly, the time-dependent Cox model shows no statistically significant
difference in survival risk between coup-installed and autocoup leaders once
relevant covariates—especially regime type—are taken into account. Rather, regime
characteristics exert a decisive influence on leadership tenure: leaders in
military and transitional regimes face significantly higher risks of removal than
those in dominant-party regimes.

#### Chapter 5: Coups, autocoups, and democracy {.unnumbered}

While the impact of coups on democratisation has received considerable scholarly
attention [@clayton2000; @powell2014a; @thyne2020], the consequences of autocoups
remain understudied due to the historical absence of relevant data. This chapter
addresses this lacuna through a quantitative analysis of how coups and autocoups
affect democratic institutions.

Whereas coups may produce leadership turnover or even regime change, autocoups
typically involve incumbents dismantling institutional constraints without
altering the core ruling coalition. Consequently, their effects are best assessed
not by regime-type transitions, but by shifts in continuous measures of
democratic quality, such as Polity V scores.

Two key claims are advanced. First, leaders often begin to erode institutional
checks in anticipation of an autocoup, resulting in declines in Polity scores
prior to the event itself. Second, while coups exhibit mixed outcomes—sometimes
enabling democratisation—autocoups almost invariably result in democratic erosion
or deeper authoritarian consolidation.

Empirical analysis using a country-fixed effects model confirms that autocoups
are associated with consistent declines in democratic quality both before and
after the event. By contrast, coups tend to cause an immediate drop in Polity
scores, although in some cases democratic recovery follows. These findings
highlight the uniquely insidious nature of autocoups, which often proceed
incrementally and under a legalistic façade.

#### Chapter 6: Conclusion and future research directions {.unnumbered}

The concluding chapter synthesises the findings of the preceding chapters,
drawing attention to the structural, strategic, and institutional dynamics that
underpin irregular leadership transitions. It contends that coups and autocoups
are not simply disruptive events, but strategic tools employed by elites to
recalibrate or entrench political authority. Their institutional legacies
diverge: while coups often destabilise regimes, autocoups typically consolidate
autocratic rule.

This chapter outlines the broader implications of these findings for
understanding the resilience of autocracy, the vulnerability of democratic
institutions, and the strategic calculus of political leaders. It also proposes
several directions for future research.

First, the broader phenomenon of executive power expansion—whether or not it
involves tenure extension—warrants systematic investigation. Given its increasing
frequency and corrosive institutional effects, the development of a dedicated
dataset on power expansions is strongly recommended.

Second, as full regime transitions become less common, future research should
focus on detecting subtle, incremental changes in political quality. Fine-grained
indicators—such as modest shifts in Polity scores—will be essential for
monitoring democratic backsliding and institutional recovery in hybrid or
semi-authoritarian regimes.

## Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Dataset Introduction {#sec-chapter3}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter presents a refined conceptualisation of autocoups, defined as
instances in which incumbent leaders extend their constitutionally mandated
tenure through extra-constitutional means, typically by circumventing or
violating term limits. By critically reviewing and synthesising overlapping
terms—such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive takeover—the chapter delineates
the conceptual boundaries of the phenomenon, identifying tenure extension as its
defining characteristic. In distinguishing autocoups from broader and more
ambiguous forms of executive aggrandisement, it advances a more analytically
precise framework for studying irregular power extensions. Building on this
conceptual foundation, the chapter introduces a novel global dataset of autocoup
events from 1945 to 2023, identifying 83 distinct cases, of which 64 were
successful. This empirical contribution enables systematic, large-N analysis of
an increasingly salient mode of authoritarian consolidation.

### Introduction

The stability and resilience of political systems rest fundamentally on the
orderly transfer of power. When leadership succession takes place within
established constitutional frameworks, it reinforces the legitimacy and
durability of governing institutions. Conversely, the breakdown of these norms
and mechanisms often precipitates political violence, institutional erosion, and
prolonged instability.

While many leadership transitions occur without disruption, a considerable
proportion do not. In particular, authoritarian regimes and fragile democracies
frequently experience two principal forms of irregular leadership outcomes: the
premature removal of incumbents and the extension of power beyond constitutional
limits.

The former—forced removals of leaders prior to the completion of their terms—has
been extensively examined under the broader category of irregular leadership
transitions. These events have profound consequences for regime stability,
democratic legitimacy, and institutional development. Accordingly, understanding
their causes and implications remains a core concern within political science.

The extant literature identifies a range of precipitating factors, including
civil war [@kokkonen2019], international conflict [@demesquita1995], ethnic
cleavages [@londregan1995], poor economic performance [@miller2012;
@krishnarajan2019], and natural disasters [@quirozflores2012]. Among these,
however, coups d’état—typically defined as illegal and overt attempts by the
military or state elites to depose a sitting executive [@powell2011]—stand out as
the most frequent and consequential source of leadership change. In autocratic
contexts, they account for approximately one-third of all leader exits,
surpassing even regular transitions [@frantz2016], while roughly two-thirds of
non-constitutional removals in dictatorships are attributable to coups
[@svolik2009]. Unsurprisingly, coups have attracted considerable scholarly
attention. Researchers have explored their structural determinants, proximate
triggers, aftermath, and effects on democratic consolidation and economic
development [@thyne2019].

Yet this focus on traditional coups risks overlooking a distinct and increasingly
salient form of irregular transition: the autocoup. In this chapter, an autocoup
is defined as an instance in which an incumbent leader extends their tenure by
subverting or bypassing constitutional term limits through extra-constitutional
means. Despite their rising incidence—particularly since the end of the Cold
War—autocoups remain under-theorised and under-examined. Conceptual fragmentation
has impeded progress, with a proliferation of overlapping and inconsistently
applied terms such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive aggrandisement
[@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This lack of definitional precision
complicates data collection and comparative analysis. Existing datasets often
conflate tenure extensions with broader forms of executive power consolidation,
thereby failing to isolate the specific mechanisms this study seeks to analyse
[@baturo2022]. Consequently, scholarship has tended to rely on qualitative case
studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], limiting the field’s
capacity for broader generalisation.

This chapter contends that these conceptual and empirical limitations obscure a
crucial dimension of contemporary politics. It thus proposes a unified analytical
framework for examining coups and autocoups as distinct yet comparable strategies
for undermining constitutional norms governing leadership succession. This
comparative approach is warranted on three grounds.

First, both coups and autocoups constitute fundamental breaches of constitutional
order, with significant implications for democratic resilience, political
legitimacy, and institutional integrity. Analysing them in tandem facilitates a
systematic examination of how different forms of irregular power transition shape
trajectories of political development and democratisation.

Second, while both disrupt established norms of succession, they operate in
opposite directions relative to the incumbent: coups terminate leadership
prematurely, whereas autocoups extend it beyond its constitutionally mandated
limit. This contrast offers a valuable lens through which to explore the
mechanisms of political survival and authoritarian consolidation.

Third, a comparative framework helps to illuminate pressing contemporary puzzles.
For instance, how can the marked decline in coup frequency since the 1990s
[@bermeo2016] be reconciled with the sustained erosion of democratic
governance—now in its eighteenth consecutive year [@freedomhouse2024freedom]? By
incorporating autocoups into the analytical schema, this study highlights the
growing significance of incremental, procedural subversions of democracy, often
orchestrated from within the existing legal and institutional architecture.

To address these gaps, the chapter makes two principal contributions. First, it
offers conceptual clarification by redefining autocoups as a subtype of irregular
leadership transition centred specifically on extra-constitutional tenure
extension. This refined definition distinguishes autocoups from broader, more
diffuse forms of executive aggrandisement. Second, it introduces a novel global
dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2023, compiled in accordance with this
reconceptualised framework, thereby enabling the first systematic large-N
analysis of the phenomenon.

The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews existing
definitions related to power extension and executive aggrandisement, culminating
in a revised conceptualisation of autocoups. Section 3 introduces the new
dataset, detailing its scope, coding criteria, and methodological foundations.
Section 4 presents an initial analysis through descriptive statistics and
illustrative case studies. The conclusion synthesises the chapter’s key
contributions and outlines directions for future research.

### literature review and clarification of definitions

A significant limitation in the study of irregular leadership transitions lies in
the insufficient integration of research on conventional coups and autocoups.
While both constitute critical mechanisms of extra-constitutional power transfer,
they have typically been examined in isolation, with limited attention paid to
their conceptual and empirical intersections.

This disjunction primarily arises from two factors: the historical
under-recognition of autocoups as a distinct subtype of irregular transition, and
the enduring conceptual ambiguity surrounding their definition. Whereas classic
coups are generally characterised by the abrupt removal of incumbents, autocoups
typically involve incumbent-led efforts to retain or expand power by
circumventing constitutional constraints. However, the inconsistent usage of
overlapping terms—such as ‘self-coup’, autogolpe, and ‘executive
aggrandisement’—has further muddied these distinctions.

Clarifying the definition of autocoups is thus a necessary step towards
constructing a comparative framework capable of capturing the full spectrum of
irregular power transitions. This section undertakes that task by distinguishing
autocoups from broader forms of executive power consolidation, and by
conceptually aligning them with traditional coups through their shared
transgression of constitutional norms.

#### Terminology {.unnumbered}

Studies of autocoups employ a wide range of terms to describe the extension of
power or tenure by incumbent leaders. The most commonly used is ‘self-coup’, or
autogolpe in Spanish [@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017;
@marsteintredet2019]. This term gained scholarly prominence following the actions
of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 1992, who dissolved Congress,
temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree [@mauceri1995;
@cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 rightly notes, ‘self-coup’ is a
potentially misleading label, as it implies that the leader acts against
themselves, whereas such moves are typically aimed at other state institutions or
constitutional constraints.

A second category of terminology includes expressions such as ‘presidential
coup’, ‘executive coup’, ‘constitutional coup’, ‘electoral coup’, ‘judicial
coup’, ‘slow-motion coup’, ‘soft coup’, and ‘parliamentary coup’
[@marsteintredet2019]. While these descriptors may offer insights into specific
mechanisms or contexts, their proliferation often leads to conceptual confusion.
Many centre on the method of power acquisition but fail to consistently identify
the perpetrator. Moreover, such mechanisms—judicial rulings, legislative
manoeuvres, or administrative decrees—may be employed either by or against
executive actors, further complicating classification.

A third group of terms includes phrases such as ‘incumbent takeover’, ‘executive
takeover’, and ‘overstay’. For instance, incumbent takeover refers to “an event
perpetuated by a ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or
informal constraints on his/her power” [@baturo2022, p. 374], drawing on earlier
work by @svolik2014. Similarly, overstay denotes “staying longer than the maximum
term as it stood when the candidate originally came into office”
[@ginsburg2011evasion, p. 1844]. These terms help to clarify the identity of the
actor (the incumbent) and the nature of the action (power consolidation or term
extension), yet they often fail to convey the illegality or unconstitutionality
of such actions. In contrast to ‘coup’, which inherently implies an unlawful
seizure of power, labels such as ‘takeover’ or ‘overstay’ may inadvertently
understate the normative gravity of the events they describe.

Given that many existing terms tend to prioritise procedural mechanisms over
normative considerations, or indeed conflate legal and extra-legal practices,
this study posits 'autocoup' as the most precise and analytically coherent term.
This term offers several key advantages.

**Definitional clarity and addressing the core essence:** 'Autocoup' precisely
denotes an incumbent leader's extension of their political tenure through
extra-constitutional means. This definition clearly distinguishes it from
conventional coups, typically initiated by external actors such as the military,
and from other, more diffuse or ill-defined instances of executive
aggrandisement.

**Emphasis on severity and normative implications:** The suffix '-coup'
powerfully signifies the grave breach of constitutional order inherent in such
actions. In both academic research and policy assessment contexts, the level of
disruption and impact is no less than, and may even exceed, that of conventional
coups, thereby imbuing the term with appropriate normative and critical weight.

**Accurate identification of the perpetrator:** The prefix 'auto-' directly
identifies the incumbent leader as the instigator of such events. This stands in
stark contrast to conventional coups, which are typically orchestrated by actors
external to the incumbent's immediate circle, such as the military or opposition
factions, thereby facilitating precise attribution.

**Promotion of conceptual coherence and comparative analysis:** 'Autocoup' shares
an etymological root with 'coup', ensuring an intrinsic conceptual link and
logical consistency. This enables systematic comparative analysis of different
yet related forms of irregular leadership transition within a unified analytical
framework, thereby deepening the understanding of these phenomena.

In summary, the term 'autocoup' not only pinpoints with precision both the actor
and the act itself but also clearly reveals the illegitimacy and gravity of the
behaviour, alongside its intrinsic theoretical connections to conventional coups.
It therefore stands as the most accurate and analytically potent conceptual tool
for capturing and analysing such political phenomena, aligning perfectly with the
unified analytical framework this study seeks to establish.

#### Definition {#sec-definition .unnumbered}

While the use of precise terminology is undoubtedly important, a further
significant issue in previous definitions of autocoups lies in the identification
of their primary characteristic: is the central feature the expansion of power,
the extension of tenure, or a combination of both? This question arises from the
marked ambiguity surrounding existing definitions of autocoups and related
concepts.

Within political science, the notions of power expansion and tenure extension
frequently overlap or are applied ambiguously, thereby contributing to conceptual
confusion. To promote greater clarity, it is essential to delineate these two
frameworks more rigorously. Power expansion refers to the process by which an
incumbent accrues authority beyond their original constitutional remit—typically
through centralisation, the weakening of institutional checks and balances, or
encroachments upon other branches of the state, such as the legislature or
judiciary. Tenure extension, by contrast, concerns efforts by a leader to remain
in office beyond the term originally prescribed, often via constitutional
amendments, the postponement or manipulation of elections, or other mechanisms
intended to bypass term limits.

Many existing definitions of autocoups conflate these dynamics or
disproportionately emphasise power expansion. For instance, @cameron1998a defines
a self-coup as “a temporary suspension of the constitution and dissolution of
congress by the executive, who rules by decree until new legislative elections
and a referendum can be held to ratify a political system with broader executive
power” (p. 220). Yet the concept of “broader executive power” is inherently vague
and open to contestation. Similarly, the term incumbent takeover, defined as “an
event perpetuated by a ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal
and/or informal constraints on his/her power” [@baturo2022, p. 374], builds on
earlier work by @svolik2014 and centres on power expansion as well. However, the
dataset employing this definition encompasses both power expansion and tenure
extension. By contrast, the term overstay is clearly defined as “staying longer
than the maximum term as it stood when the candidate originally came into office”
[@ginsburg2011evasion, p. 1844], thereby focusing specifically on tenure
extension.

This thesis contends that tenure extension ought to be regarded as the primary
and defining characteristic of an autocoup, for several reasons. First, this
focus aligns autocoups conceptually with traditional coups. A classic coup is
typically characterised by the forcible and premature removal of a sitting
executive; it does not necessarily entail a reduction in the leader’s powers, but
rather a disruption of their tenure. By the same logic, an autocoup should be
defined by the prolongation of tenure, not solely by the expansion of executive
authority. An incumbent may experience a diminution of power while remaining in
office—such an instance would not be coded as a coup. Similarly, a leader who
consolidates authority without exceeding term limits would fall under the
category of executive aggrandisement, but not that of an autocoup.

Second, in practice, power expansion often functions as a strategic means to
enable tenure extension. The widely cited case of President Alberto Fujimori in
Peru exemplifies this dynamic. Although his 1992 actions involved the suspension
of the constitution and the dissolution of Congress, the ultimate objective was
to ensure continued rule. The 1993 Constitution permitted him to seek a second
term, which he won in 1995. Subsequently, a law of “authentic interpretation”
passed by his congressional allies enabled him to run again in 2000—a move
steeped in controversy. Although he secured re-election, his regime collapsed in
2000 amidst corruption and human rights scandals, prompting his flight to Japan
[@ezrow2019]. In this light, it is illogical for incumbents to consolidate power
unless they intend to overstay in office; such actions merely strengthen their
successors, whose interests may diverge from their own.

Third, the measurement of power expansion presents greater methodological
challenges than the identification of tenure extension. For example,
@cameron1998a defines a self-coup as involving both constitutional suspension and
congressional dissolution. Yet it remains unclear whether either act alone
constitutes an autocoup, whether both are required, or whether they should be
treated as distinct events. While the complexity of measurement ought not to
preclude the consideration of power expansion, a clear point of departure is
required. This study therefore designates tenure extension as the definitional
core of autocoups, leaving the broader discussion of power expansion (and its
inverse, power contraction) to future research.

Based on these considerations, this study defines an autocoup as:

> *The extension of an incumbent leader’s tenure in office beyond the originally
> mandated limit, achieved through extra-constitutional means.*

This definition places tenure extension at the centre of the concept, while
acknowledging that power expansion may coexist. First, the term incumbent leader
refers to the de facto national leader, irrespective of their formal title. For
instance, although Vladimir Putin formally stepped down as President of Russia in
2008 and assumed the premiership, effective political power remained in his
hands. During this period, the presidency—held by Dmitry Medvedev—functioned
largely as a symbolic office under Putin’s continued control [@chaisty2019]. To
ensure consistency and minimise arbitrariness, this study employs the Archigos
dataset [@goemans2009] to determine whether an incumbent has effectively remained
in power.

Second, although tenure extension is the definitional cornerstone, this framework
does not exclude simultaneous power expansion. Both may occur in tandem, but the
decisive criterion remains the act of exceeding one’s original time in office. In
the Fujimori case, for example, the 1992 actions were not coded as an autocoup
until the adoption of the 1993 constitutional amendment enabling his re-election.

Third, autocoups may be executed through both legal and illegal means. For
instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye postponed general elections until
1969 after coming to power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan President José Eduardo dos
Santos suspended elections during much of his nearly four-decade rule [@baturo].
These represent clear violations of constitutional norms. Other instances—such as
Putin’s 2008 manoeuvre—may not be overtly illegal but nonetheless undermine the
constitutional spirit intended to limit consecutive terms. Consequently, this
definition emphasises the functional illegitimacy of such actions, regardless of
their formal legality, particularly where the incumbent is the direct and
principal beneficiary.

Finally, an incumbent who seeks re-election in accordance with the existing
constitution is not engaging in an autocoup. However, should they subsequently
refuse to concede defeat and remain in power beyond their lawful mandate, such
conduct would indeed constitute an autocoup.

By clarifying these definitional boundaries, this chapter establishes the
conceptual foundation for the autocoup dataset introduced in the following
section.

### Introduction to the autocoup dataset

#### Defining the scope {.unnumbered}

Classifying political events as autocoups often necessitates addressing ambiguous
or borderline cases. To ensure consistency and minimise interpretive uncertainty,
this study adopts a coding strategy grounded in the definition articulated in the
preceding section. Specifically, only those instances in which incumbent leaders
extend their originally mandated term in office are coded as autocoups. Cases
involving power consolidation in the absence of tenure extension are excluded
from the dataset.

The temporal scope of the dataset spans the period from 1945 to the end of 2023,
reflecting the most recent data available at the time of compilation. The
geographical scope is global, encompassing leaders from all countries and
regions.

#### Classifying autocoups {.unnumbered}

In categorising autocoups, this study prioritises the methods employed by
incumbents, while outcomes constitute a secondary classificatory dimension.
Additional features are recorded where relevant information is available.

##### Evasion of term limits {.unnumbered}

One of the most prevalent tactics in autocoups is the evasion of term limits.
Incumbents deploy ostensibly legal mechanisms to prolong their hold on power,
primarily through the manipulation of constitutional provisions. Such manoeuvres
may include pressuring legislatures or courts to reinterpret term limits,
amending the constitution to allow extended terms, or replacing the constitution
entirely. In some instances, referendums are employed to confer a veneer of
democratic legitimacy. These extensions may range from the addition of a single
term to indefinite tenure.

**Changing the length of a term:** Incumbents may increase the duration of a
single term (e.g., from four to six years) without altering the number of terms
permitted. Examples include President David Dacko (Central African Republic,
1962), President Grégoire Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and President Augusto
Pinochet (Chile, 1988).

**Enabling re-election:** This involves modifying constitutional or legal
frameworks to permit re-election where it was previously barred. For instance,
President Carlos Menem of Argentina amended the constitution in 1993 to allow
himself to seek re-election, thereby extending his tenure.

**Abolishing term limits:** President Paul Biya of Cameroon successfully removed
presidential term limits in 2008, thereby enabling indefinite re-election.

**Declaring leadership for life:** This approach retains the semblance of
electoral competition, albeit often through manipulated or uncontested elections.
President Sukarno of Indonesia attempted to declare himself president for life in
1963, although this effort ultimately failed.

These strategies are frequently deployed in combination. For example, President
François Duvalier of Haiti first amended the constitution in 1961 to permit
immediate re-election and subsequently declared himself president for life in
1964.

##### Electoral manipulation and rigging {.unnumbered}

The second most frequently observed strategy in autocoups involves the
manipulation of electoral processes to ensure the incumbent remains in office.

**Delaying or cancelling elections:** The postponement of scheduled elections
without legitimate justification is a recurrent tactic. President François
Tombalbaye of Chad delayed general elections until 1969, having come to power in
1960. Similarly, President José Eduardo dos Santos of Angola suspended elections
throughout his tenure from 1979 to 2017.

**Rejecting unfavourable electoral outcomes:** Incumbents may refuse to concede
defeat and attempt to remain in office by unconstitutional means. A prominent
example is President Donald Trump of the United States, who declined to accept
the results of the 2020 presidential election and sought to overturn them.

**Electoral rigging:** Securing implausibly high vote shares is a key indicator
of electoral manipulation. This study codes elections in which incumbents receive
over 90 per cent of the vote as indicative of an autocoup. President Teodoro
Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently achieved over 95 per cent in
multiparty elections since 1996.

**Exclusion of opposition:** Preventing opposition parties or candidates from
contesting elections—thereby converting them into de facto uncontested
contests—is considered a clear indicator of an autocoup.

##### Installation of a figurehead {.unnumbered}

Some incumbents seek to circumvent term limits by installing a trusted proxy or
figurehead, thereby retaining de facto control over state affairs while
relinquishing formal office.

A paradigmatic example is the 2008 presidential transition in Russia. Confronted
with constitutional term limits, President Vladimir Putin endorsed Dmitry
Medvedev as his successor, who was duly elected. Medvedev then appointed Putin as
Prime Minister. Despite the formal shift in roles, most analysts agree that Putin
retained substantial influence, effectively rendering Medvedev a figurehead.

It is important that the identification of such cases be grounded in objective
criteria to avoid arbitrary classification. Accordingly, this study relies on the
Archigos dataset to determine leadership status. If a former officeholder is not
recorded in Archigos as the country’s leader—despite wielding informal power—they
are not coded as engaging in a figurehead-style autocoup within this dataset.

##### Reassignment of supreme authority {.unnumbered}

This strategy entails restructuring the constitutional or legal framework to
create a new, more powerful office, which the incumbent subsequently assumes
after formally leaving their original post.

In 2017, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan orchestrated a
constitutional referendum that transformed Turkey from a parliamentary to a
presidential system. The newly empowered presidency carried significantly
enhanced executive authority. Erdoğan then ran for, and won, the redefined
presidency, thereby maintaining control under a revised institutional
arrangement.

##### One-time extension arrangements {.unnumbered}

In certain cases, bespoke arrangements are enacted to extend an incumbent’s
tenure without altering the broader constitutional framework. These arrangements
are explicitly tailored to the current officeholder, with institutional rules on
tenure or term limits intended to resume their standard application for future
leaders. For example, in 2004, Lebanon extended President Émile Lahoud’s term by
three years through a one-off legal provision applying solely to his incumbency.

#### Data coding {.unnumbered}

The autocoup dataset is constructed on the basis of established datasets and
scholarly literature, thereby ensuring both reliability and comprehensiveness.
The principal sources employed for coding are listed in Table @tbl-source.

The Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political Leaders’ Affiliation
Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded] offer detailed records of national leaders
from 1875 to 2023. Although the temporal focus of this study is limited to events
occurring from 1945 onwards, these datasets are essential for identifying de
facto leaders and distinguishing them from nominal heads of state.

The Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022], which synthesises information from
eleven separate sources, provides a broad inventory of cases wherein executive
actors significantly curtailed institutional constraints on their authority. As
this dataset encompasses both power consolidation and tenure extension cases,
cross-referencing with Archigos and PLAD was necessary to determine whether
individual cases satisfied the definitional criteria for an autocoup.

```{r}

# nrow(Autocoup)
# nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))
# nrow(Autocoup) - nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))
```

In total, 83 events were identified and coded as autocoups. Of these, 50
correspond to entries within the Incumbent Takeover dataset, while the remaining
33 were newly identified and coded by the author through cross-verification with
supplementary materials, including Archigos, PLAD, and contemporary news sources.

Although a majority of cases originate from the Incumbent Takeover dataset, the
present study does not constitute a replication of that work. Of the 279 cases
catalogued in Incumbent Takeover, 229 were excluded from the current analysis on
the grounds that they entailed power consolidation without any accompanying
attempt to extend the leader’s tenure. Such instances lie beyond the definitional
scope of autocoups as operationalised in this thesis. This conceptual refinement
constitutes the principal point of departure from the Incumbent Takeover
framework.

The final dataset comprises 14 structured variables, in addition to a free-text
field for supplementary notes. The variables are as follows:

-   **Country identification:** Country code (ccode) and country name (country),
    following the standards of the Correlates of War project [@stinnett2002].

-   **Leader information:** Name of the de facto leader (leader_name), coded in
    accordance with the conventions employed in the Archigos and PLAD datasets.

-   **Timeline variables:** Date the leader assumed office (entry_date), date of
    departure (exit_date), date of the autocoup-defining event (autocoup_date),
    and commencement date of the extended term (extending_date).

-   **Power transition methods:** Mode of accession (entry_method), mode of
    departure (exit_method), and binary indicators for regular or irregular entry
    (entry_regular) and exit (exit_regular).

-   **Autocoup characteristics:** Method of tenure extension (autocoup_method)
    and outcome of the attempt (autocoup_outcome), categorised as: "failed and
    removed from office", "failed but completed original tenure", or
    "successful". For successful cases, the duration of the additional term is
    calculated as the interval between extending_date and exit_date.

-   **Data source:** The principal dataset from which the case was coded
    (source).

-   **Additional notes:** Contextual commentary on exceptional or borderline
    cases (notes).

Several coding challenges and methodological decisions warrant further
elaboration. In instances where tenure extensions occurred incrementally, the
`autocoup_date` corresponds to a pivotal event—such as the passage of a
constitutional amendment, a legislative vote, or the outcome of a referendum.
Where leaders attempted multiple autocoups, details are consolidated in the notes
field. Particular care was taken to distinguish between mere power consolidation
and explicit efforts to prolong tenure, which necessitated triangulation across
multiple sources. Furthermore, assessing the success or failure of an
autocoup—particularly in under-reported contexts—frequently required extensive
background research and qualitative judgment.

#### Data descriptions {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| label: data_descriptions

autocoup_desc <- Autocoup |>

  ) |>

```

The primary coding process identified 83 instances of autocoups between 1945 and
2023, spanning 63 countries. This comprehensive dataset provides a robust
empirical foundation for analysing trends and patterns in autocoup attempts
across a wide array of political and institutional contexts.

A breakdown of the methods employed by incumbents to extend their tenure is
presented in Table @tbl-autocoup_method. The most prevalent strategy is the
legalisation or reintroduction of re-election, accounting for 37 cases. This is
followed by the removal of term limits (10 cases) and the declaration of the
leader as president for life (7 cases). Other tactics, such as the cancellation
of scheduled elections or the refusal to concede electoral defeat, appear less
frequently. Electoral rigging is recorded in only one case—primarily because it
is often difficult to verify with certainty, despite strong indications in many
instances.

Autocoups exhibit a notably high overall success rate of $77\%$, in sharp
contrast to the approximate $50\%$ success rate observed in classical military
coups. Several factors may explain this discrepancy. First, incumbents possess
direct access to state resources and institutional mechanisms, which can be
deployed strategically to their advantage. Second, in contrast to the abrupt and
confrontational nature of traditional coups, autocoups tend to unfold gradually
and deliberately, affording incumbents time to consolidate elite support and
cultivate public legitimacy. Third, many autocoup strategies are implemented
under the guise of legality—via constitutional amendments or judicial
rulings—which reduces overt resistance and complicates efforts to mobilise
effective opposition. Finally, incumbents typically exercise considerable
influence over key state institutions, including the judiciary, legislature, and
security services, which facilitates the planning and consolidation of such
actions.

However, success rates differ markedly depending on the method employed. Certain
strategies appear to be consistently effective. For example, removing term
limits, cancelling elections, declaring oneself leader for life, delaying
elections, and installing figurehead successors all exhibit a $100\%$ success
rate within the dataset. Notably, these approaches represent some of the most
flagrant violations of constitutional norms concerning executive succession. This
pattern suggests that outcomes are shaped less by the degree of legal or
constitutional transgression than by the underlying distribution of political
power. In other words, the success of an autocoup is determined not by the
legality of the act, but by the incumbent’s capacity to control coercive,
judicial, and legislative institutions. Leaders who command overwhelming
authority are both willing and able to disregard constitutional constraints
precisely because their dominance insulates them from meaningful resistance.

By contrast, refusal to accept electoral defeat exhibits the lowest success rate,
with only one of four such attempts proving successful. Although the sample is
limited, this pattern may reflect the greater institutional resilience of
electoral democracies, stronger civil society mobilisation, more intensive
international scrutiny, and the inherently high-risk nature of overturning
electoral outcomes. These factors may increase the probability of failure for
incumbents who pursue this path.

Notably, in contrast to classical coups, which predominantly occur in autocratic
regimes, a substantial proportion of autocoups are carried out within democratic
settings. Of the 83 identified autocoup attempts, 30 took place in democracies—of
which 29 occurred in presidential democracies—constituting approximately $36\%$
of the total. By comparison, traditional coups have been significantly less
frequent in democratic contexts, with only 99 out of 493 cases ( $20\%$ ) taking
place in such regimes. This marked disparity will be examined in greater depth in
Chapter 3.

### Case studies

#### High frequency and success rate of autocoups in post-communist regimes

The dataset reveals a notably high incidence and success rate of autocoup
attempts in post-communist states. These countries, which were governed under
communist rule prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, have predominantly
transitioned into so-called ‘hybrid regimes’ [@nurumov2019], with only a few—most
notably China—retaining an overtly communist political identity. Within these
contexts, the dataset records 12 attempts by incumbents to extend their tenure,
of which only two were unsuccessful. A closer examination of these cases reveals
several shared structural and political characteristics.

Firstly, many post-communist regimes inherited authoritarian institutional
legacies. While they formally transitioned away from communism, these states
often preserved core authoritarian features, particularly the centralisation of
executive authority.

Secondly, elite continuity has been a hallmark of post-communist transitions.
Rather than a clear break with the previous regime, many transitions saw the
retention of former communist elites, who reconstituted themselves within
ostensibly democratic frameworks, frequently dominating newly formed political
institutions.

Thirdly, democratic procedures have frequently been subverted in post-communist
contexts. Although democratic reforms introduced elections and constitutional
term limits, the enduring institutional structures of communist rule have often
facilitated the manipulation of electoral processes and the circumvention of
formal constraints on executive power [@nurumov2019].

##### Lifelong ruler: Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus {.unnumbered}

Alexander Lukashenko, a former member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian
SSR, rose to national prominence as the head of Belarus’s interim anti-corruption
committee following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1994, he was elected
as the country’s first president, a position he has held continuously throughout
the period under examination. The original 1994 constitution imposed a two-term
limit on the presidency; however, this restriction was repealed in 2004 through a
constitutional amendment.

Since his initial election, international observers have consistently found that
Belarusian elections fall short of democratic standards. Despite sustained
domestic opposition and recurrent mass protests, Lukashenko has claimed repeated
re-election victories, frequently with vote shares exceeding 80 per cent. This
trajectory is emblematic of a broader pattern across the post-Soviet space,
particularly in Central Asia, where former high-ranking communist officials
transitioned into presidential office and have retained power with limited
institutional constraints.

##### Dynastic succession: Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan {.unnumbered}

Nursultan Nazarbayev served as the first president of independent Kazakhstan from
1991 until 2019. Prior to independence, he was the First Secretary of the
Communist Party of Kazakhstan, thereby exercising de facto leadership both before
and after the Soviet collapse. Following independence, Nazarbayev was elected
president and remained in power through a series of constitutional and legal
modifications, including the adoption of new constitutions that effectively reset
term limits.

Importantly, Nazarbayev did not formally abolish term limits. Rather, a
constitutional exemption was created specifically for the “First President”,
allowing him to circumvent term restrictions while maintaining a veneer of legal
continuity [@nurumov2019]. Unlike Lukashenko, who has remained in office
continuously since 1994 up to the time of this study, Nazarbayev formally
resigned in 2019, designating Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as his successor. However,
Nazarbayev continued to exercise significant influence through his position as
Chairman of the Security Council, a role he retained until 2022. This illustrates
the persistence of informal executive dominance even after nominal power has been
relinquished.

#### Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin America

Latin America has a longstanding tradition of imposing constitutional term limits
on executive authority. Simón Bolívar, often regarded as a founding father of
several Latin American republics, initially endorsed this principle, declaring in
1819 that “nothing is as dangerous as allowing the same citizen to remain in
power for a long time... That is the origin of usurpation and tyranny”
[@ginsburg2019, p. 38]. Although Bolívar later revised his stance—asserting in
his 1826 address to the Constitutional Assembly that "a president for life with
the right to choose the successor is the most sublime inspiration for the
republican order"—the concept of term limitation became deeply ingrained in the
region’s political culture. Indeed, approximately 81% of Latin American
constitutions adopted between independence and 1985 included some form of
presidential term limit [@marsteintredet2019a].

An analysis of autocoup cases in the region reveals two noteworthy patterns
regarding re-election dynamics.

##### Frequent success in breaking non-re-election rules {.unnumbered}

Unlike many presidential systems in which two consecutive terms are the norm,
Latin American constitutions have historically favoured more restrictive
arrangements. According to @marsteintredet2019a, $64.9\%$ of constitutions in the
region between independence and 1985 prohibited immediate re-election, while
$5.9\%$ forbade re-election altogether.

Nevertheless, adherence to these rules has varied. Countries such as Mexico,
which enshrined a strict non-re-election clause in 1911 at the outset of the
Mexican Revolution, have consistently upheld this restriction [@klesner2019].
Panama and Uruguay have similarly refrained from amending their re-election
provisions, while Costa Rica has permitted immediate re-election only briefly
(1897–1913) since its initial prohibition in 1859 [@marsteintredet2019a]. In
contrast, several states have frequently amended or circumvented their
constitutional term limits.

The pursuit of re-election or immediate re-election has often served as a central
motive for autocoup attempts aimed at consolidating executive power. This study
identifies 22 autocoup cases in Latin America, of which 14 (over $63\%$ )
involved efforts to enable re-election or immediate re-election. Of these, 9 were
successful, yielding a success rate exceeding $64\%$.

Importantly, not all such leaders sought indefinite tenure. Many stepped down
after securing and completing a second term. Notable examples include Fernando
Henrique Cardoso (Brazil, 1995–2003), Danilo Medina (Dominican Republic,
2012–2020), and Juan Orlando Hernández (Honduras, 2014–2022) [@ginsburg2019;
@marsteintredet2019a; @landau2019; @baturo2019; @neto2019].

##### Resistance to further extensions {.unnumbered}

The relative restraint exhibited by many leaders should not be interpreted as a
lack of ambition for further tenure. Rather, it reflects the fact that additional
extension attempts often failed, and incumbents acquiesced to these outcomes
without resorting to overt manipulation or repression.

While autocoups that enable a single additional term tend to be relatively
successful, efforts to prolong tenure beyond two terms encounter greater
resistance and are more likely to fail. Two contrasting cases illustrate these
divergent trajectories.

**Unsuccessful extension–Carlos Menem (Argentina):** President Menem secured a
second term following a 1994 constitutional amendment permitting one re-election,
and he was re-elected in 1995. However, his subsequent attempt to reset the term
count—arguing that his first term (1988–1995) had occurred under a previous
constitutional framework—was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court in 1999
[@llanos2019]. A comparable outcome was observed in the case of President Álvaro
Uribe in Colombia (2002–2010) [@baturo2019].

**Successful extension–Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua):** In contrast, President Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua succeeded in extending his tenure through a series of
judicial and legislative manoeuvres. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice
authorised his candidacy for the 2011 election. Subsequently, in 2014, the
National Assembly passed constitutional amendments abolishing presidential term
limits, thereby enabling Ortega to pursue indefinite five-year terms. He has
remained in office continuously since 2007 [@close2019].

#### As common as classical coups: Autocoups in African countries

Classical coups have historically been widespread across the African continent,
accounting for approximately $45\%$ of all coups globally—219 out of 493 recorded
incidents since 1950—affecting 45 of the 54 African states [@powell2011]. While
autocoups occur less frequently than traditional coups, they nonetheless
represent a significant political phenomenon within Africa. Of the 83 documented
cases of autocoups worldwide, $43\%$ (36 cases) have taken place on the
continent, spanning 29 countries. Notably, the success rate of African autocoups
exceeds $77\%$ (28 out of 36), a figure that significantly surpasses the regional
success rate for classical coups (approximately $50\%$ ) and aligns with the
global average success rate for autocoups ( $77\%$ ).

Identifying a clear and consistent pattern underlying autocoups in Africa proves
challenging—reflecting the broader analytical complexity associated with
classical coups. Several explanatory factors have been proposed in the
literature.

**Natural resource wealth:** States endowed with oil, diamonds, or other
strategic commodities often witness greater incentives and capacities among
incumbents to seek term extensions and consolidate power [@posner;
@cheeseman2015; @cheeseman2019a].

**Democratic quality:** The degree of democratic consolidation strongly
influences respect for constitutional term limits [@reyntjens2016].

**International influence:** External actors, including bilateral donors and
international organisations, may exert diplomatic or economic pressure to
dissuade leaders from subverting term limits [@brown2001; @tangri2010].

**Opposition strength and party cohesion:** The ability of opposition forces to
coordinate effectively, as well as the incumbent’s success in maintaining unity
within the ruling party, are critical factors shaping the feasibility of term
extension efforts [@cheeseman2019].

Drawing on the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, @cassani2020
identifies human rights abuses and the desire to evade legal or political
accountability as key motivations behind efforts to overstay in power. The more
authoritarian a leader’s governing style, the more likely they are to challenge
constitutional constraints. Moreover, incumbents who can secure the loyalty of
the military—often through strategic use of public investment—are significantly
more likely to succeed in extending their tenure.

Although both classical coups and autocoups continue to be features of African
politics, a marked shift has occurred since the end of the Cold War in 1991.
While the incidence of traditional coups has declined, autocoups have become
increasingly prevalent. This trend is partly attributable to the widespread
adoption of multiparty electoral systems in the 1990s, often accompanied by the
formal institutionalisation of presidential term limits [@cassani2020;
@cheeseman2019].

Prior to 1991, personalist and military regimes predominated across much of the
continent, and constitutional term limits were seldom enshrined. The post-Cold
War expansion of democratic frameworks contributed to a rise in the adoption of
such provisions, and, correspondingly, in attempts to circumvent them. However,
it is important to stress that this increase in challenges to term limits should
not be interpreted as indicative of declining compliance. On the contrary,
overall turnover in executive leadership has increased compared to earlier
decades, suggesting that while violations continue to attract attention,
adherence to constitutional rules has become more widespread.

### Summary

This chapter has offered a comprehensive analysis of autocoups, focusing on
political episodes in which incumbent leaders extend their tenure beyond
constitutionally prescribed limits. By refining existing definitions and
distinguishing autocoups from related concepts—such as self-coups, autogolpes,
and executive takeovers—the study introduces a novel dataset cataloguing 83 cases
of autocoups from 1945 to 2023, of which 64 were successful.

The revised conceptual framework, combined with the newly assembled dataset,
enables a more expansive and systematic analysis of irregular leadership
transitions. Whereas traditional scholarship has primarily centred on the
premature termination of leadership through coups, this study broadens the
analytical scope to encompass irregular tenure extensions. This approach yields a
more nuanced understanding of the ways in which incumbents may subvert
constitutional norms and democratic procedures to consolidate their authority.

Nonetheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the proposed
definition of an autocoup warrants further scholarly scrutiny and debate before
it can achieve broader consensus. Despite rigorous efforts to ensure consistency,
certain coding decisions—particularly in ambiguous or borderline cases—may
inevitably entail an element of subjective judgement. Second, while this thesis
concentrates on tenure extensions, instances involving the expansion of executive
power without a formal extension of tenure also deserve deeper conceptual and
empirical investigation.

Despite these constraints, the research makes a substantive contribution to the
literature on political stability, leadership dynamics, and democratic
resilience. The dataset provides a valuable empirical foundation for future
inquiries into the mechanisms and motivations underpinning autocoups.

Several promising directions for further research emerge. Subsequent studies
could utilise the dataset to examine the long-term institutional consequences of
autocoups, including their role in democratic backsliding, authoritarian
entrenchment, and the personalisation of executive power. Additionally,
comparative analyses between autocoups and classical coups may illuminate the
evolving strategies employed by incumbents to consolidate authority across
diverse regime types and political environments.

## Power Dynamics and Autocoup Attempts {#sec-chapter2}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter explores the determinants of autocoup attempts, aiming to deepen
understanding of the political dynamics that underpin tenure extensions by
incumbent leaders. Addressing a notable gap in the existing literature, the study
contends that the balance of power plays a critical role in shaping the
likelihood of autocoup events. In contrast to classical coups—which are often
triggered by unstable or fragmented power structures—autocoups tend to arise in
contexts characterised by stable and concentrated power.

To operationalise the concept of power balance in an observable manner, regime
type is employed as a proxy, reflecting the structural distribution of power
between incumbents and potential institutional constraints or elite challengers.
Using a bias-reduced logistic regression model, the analysis finds that regime
type is a significant predictor of autocoup attempts. Leaders operating within
regimes marked by concentrated power are more prone to extend their tenure
unconstitutionally. In particular, presidential democracies and personalist
autocracies are found to be significantly more susceptible to autocoup attempts
than dominant-party regimes.

The study contributes to the broader literature on irregular leadership
transitions by offering a more systematic and empirically grounded account of the
conditions under which incumbents seek to subvert constitutional term limits.

### Introduction

As outlined in Chapter 2, scholarly engagement with autocoups has been hampered
by conceptual ambiguity and the absence of systematic data, thereby limiting the
scope for rigorous empirical investigation. To address this lacuna, the present
chapter aims to make a substantive contribution through a quantitative analysis
of the determinants of autocoup attempts. Following the methodological precedent
established by empirical studies of classical coups—which have primarily examined
the antecedents of coup initiation [@gassebner2016]—this chapter similarly
explores why some incumbent leaders attempt to extend their tenure through
autocoups, while others do not.

There are three principal reasons for investigating the determinants of
autocoups. First, autocoups constitute one of the most prevalent forms of
irregular leadership transition, with over 80 documented cases since 1945 (as
discussed in Chapter 2). Their frequency has increased notably since 2000,
coinciding with a marked global decline in classical coups [@bermeo2016;
@thyne2019]. Second, autocoups exert profound effects on political stability and
democratic development, often resulting in enduring institutional degradation.
Third, identifying the drivers of autocoup attempts is essential for future
research into their consequences; without a clear understanding of the conditions
under which autocoups occur, efforts to prevent them or mitigate their
detrimental effects remain constrained.

Although autocoups differ fundamentally from classical coups—particularly in that
they are instigated by incumbents rather than external challengers—the two
phenomena share key features as disruptions to established political order.
Accordingly, methodological tools commonly applied in the study of traditional
coups may be fruitfully adapted to analyse autocoups. However, despite the
extensive literature on coup dynamics [@gassebner2016], regime type is frequently
treated as a background condition or control variable rather than a central
explanatory factor.

This chapter advances the argument that the likelihood of autocoup attempts is
shaped significantly by the structural distribution of power inherent in regime
type. In contrast to classical coups, which often emerge from unstable or
contested power structures, autocoups tend to occur in regimes characterised by
concentrated and stable authority. Given the challenges of directly measuring
internal power configurations, regime type is employed as a proxy variable. The
underlying premise is that regime type reflects core institutional arrangements,
including the distribution of authority, the robustness of constitutional
constraints, and the capacity of incumbents to subvert democratic norms.
Analysing cross-regime variation thus facilitates a deeper understanding of the
institutional foundations that condition autocoup risk. These power structures
tend to be relatively stable over time, as they both shape and are shaped by the
regime’s overarching institutional design [@geddes2014].

To empirically test this proposition, the chapter utilises both a standard
logistic regression model and a bias-reduced logistic regression model to assess
how regime type influences the likelihood of incumbents extending their tenure
through extra-constitutional means.

Given the paucity of quantitative research on autocoups, this study offers a
potentially pioneering contribution to the empirical literature by providing a
theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous account of their
determinants.

The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 examines the
dynamics and outcomes of autocoup attempts. Section 3 outlines the research
design, including the methodological approach and variables employed. Section 4
presents and interprets the empirical findings, highlighting key patterns and
implications. Section 5 concludes by summarising the core insights and reflecting
on their broader significance for understanding and mitigating the risks posed by
autocoups.

### Dynamics of autocoup attempts

Like traditional coup attempts, autocoups are shaped by two fundamental elements:
the disposition of incumbent leaders—referring to their motivations and
willingness to act—and their capability, defined by the resources and
opportunities at their disposal. However, autocoups exhibit two notable features
that distinguish them from classical coups. First, whereas traditional coups
occur predominantly in autocracies [@thyne2014], over one-third of documented
autocoups have taken place in democratic regimes, as outlined in Chapter 2.
Second, while the success rate of traditional coups hovers around $50\%$, more
than $77\%$ of autocoup attempts have resulted in success, according to the
dataset introduced in Chapter 2. These distinctions indicate that the dynamics of
disposition and capability underlying autocoups differ significantly from those
of traditional coups.

This section explores the complex dynamics of autocoup attempts, with particular
emphasis on how the motivations of incumbents, the determinants of success, and
the institutional frameworks of various regime types shape the vulnerability of
states to such extra-constitutional power extensions.

#### Motivations for autocoups {.unnumbered}

Incumbents seeking to prolong their tenure may be driven by a range of
motivations, broadly falling into three principal categories: personal ambition,
appeals to national interest, and self-preservation.

First, the pursuit of personal power constitutes a compelling incentive for many
leaders. The capacity to govern free from institutional constraints enables
incumbents to exercise dominance over national policy-making, access state
resources, influence the judiciary and legislature, and retain the prestige
associated with holding high office. For some, the aspiration to secure a lasting
political legacy—to be remembered as a transformative figure—further amplifies
the appeal of extended rule.

Second, tenure extensions are often justified by incumbents in the name of the
national interest. A commonly advanced rationale suggests that a single term is
insufficient for the completion of long-term reforms or development initiatives.
Within this narrative, remaining in power is portrayed as essential to ensuring
the continuity and success of ongoing projects. The autocoup is thus framed not
as an act of self-interest, but as a necessary step for the greater good.

Third, autocoups may serve as mechanisms of self-preservation. Incumbents facing
the prospect of prosecution for corruption, human rights violations, or other
transgressions may view continued tenure as a means of preserving legal immunity.
Additionally, those who have amassed significant political adversaries during
their rule may fear retribution upon leaving office. In such cases, the extension
of power is not merely a product of ambition but also a strategy for
survival—intended to shield the leader from legal or political repercussions.

#### Power dynamics and autocoups {.unnumbered}

While motivations may initiate an incumbent’s decision to pursue an autocoup, the
decisive factor often lies in their ability to implement and sustain such an
action. The relatively high frequency and remarkable success rate of
autocoups—over $77%$, compared to approximately $50\%$ for classical
coups—suggest that incumbents benefit from notable structural advantages when
attempting to consolidate power. These advantages are not limited to autocracies
but are also evident in democratic systems, underscoring the variation in
institutional leverage available to incumbents across different regime types.

This reality necessitates a closer examination of state power structures,
particularly the allocation of control over the military. The allegiance of the
armed forces is a critical determinant of autocoup outcomes. If the military
remains loyal to the executive, resistance—whether from civil society, the
judiciary, or the legislature—can be suppressed or marginalised. Conversely, open
defiance or refusal by the military to support the incumbent may render an
autocoup untenable.

Nevertheless, it is reductive to assume that formal authority as
commander-in-chief guarantees unqualified control. Just as it is overly
simplistic to attribute the success of traditional coups solely to the presence
of military force [@singh2016], it is equally erroneous to presume that
incumbents invariably enjoy the unconditional loyalty of the armed forces.
Nominal titles often obscure the complex and sometimes precarious dynamics
underpinning military allegiance.

In autocratic regimes, while the military may not be bound by constitutional
principles, it is not inherently loyal to the head of state. Executives depend on
military officers to execute their commands; however, these officers may harbour
independent political ambitions or competing loyalties. A case in point is Uganda
in 1971, when President Milton Obote attempted to dismiss General Idi Amin. In
response, Amin exploited his influence within the armed forces to mount a
successful coup, ousting Obote [@sudduth2017].

By contrast, in consolidated democracies, military loyalty is typically
institutionalised through allegiance to the constitution rather than to
individual officeholders. For example, in the United States, following the 2020
presidential election, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, publicly reaffirmed the military’s constitutional commitment:

> “We are unique among militaries. We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a
> tyrant or a dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual. We take an oath
> to the Constitution.”
>
> — (US Army Museum, 12 November 2020[^1])

In hybrid regimes or fragile democracies, attempts to prolong executive tenure
may entail significant political risks. In Niger, for example, President Mamadou
Tandja’s attempt in 2009 to amend the constitution to permit a third term
precipitated a military coup in 2010 [@miller2016]. Similarly, in Honduras the
same year, President Manuel Zelaya was removed from office by the military after
seeking to alter the constitution to allow immediate re-election
[@muñoz-portillo2019].

#### Regime types and autocoups {.unnumbered}

Given the complexities discussed, a more effective analytical strategy entails
evaluating the broader balance of power within political systems. As direct
observation of this balance is inherently challenging, this study adopts regime
type as a proxy—an approach consistent with established methodologies in
comparative politics. Regime types encapsulate the institutional architecture of
power distribution, particularly with respect to control over the military,
political appointments, and policy-making authority.

Following the typology developed by @geddes2014, autocratic regimes can be
categorised as follows:

**Military regimes** are governed by a junta, typically comprising senior
military officers who collectively determine leadership and policy direction.
Notable examples include Brazil (1964–1985), Argentina (1976–1983), and El
Salvador (1948–1984) [@geddes1999].

**Personalist regimes** revolve around a dominant individual who wields unchecked
authority over the military, policy decisions, and succession processes.
Prominent instances include Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic
(1930–1961), Idi Amin in Uganda (1971–1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the
Central African Republic (1966–1979) [@geddes1999].

**Dominant-party regimes** concentrate authority within a structured political
party, with the leader operating either as part of or at the helm of the party
apparatus. Illustrative cases include the PRI in Mexico, CCM in Tanzania, and the
Leninist parties of Eastern Europe [@geddes1999].

Among these regime types, personalist autocracies are particularly conducive to
autocoups. The concentration of power in a single individual weakens
institutional checks and fosters loyalty—particularly from the military—through
mechanisms of personal patronage. While military regimes are rooted in coercive
power, they are often beset by internal factionalism, rendering them more
susceptible to traditional coups than to autocoups. Dominant-party regimes occupy
a more ambiguous position: although party structures can constrain executive
action, exceptionally powerful party leaders may still initiate autocoups, as
exemplified by Xi Jinping’s constitutional amendments in 2018 within a
dominant-party framework.

Monarchies, though technically autocratic, generally render autocoups redundant,
as monarchs typically rule for life by constitutional design.

A key clarification is warranted at this juncture: why might leaders in
personalist regimes—already possessing extensive authority—feel compelled to
extend their tenure further? The answer lies in distinguishing between the scope
and duration of power. While such leaders may exercise considerable de facto
control over state institutions, many initially assume office via legal or
constitutional channels, necessitating a gradual process of consolidation. In
this context, autocoups function as formal mechanisms to institutionalise
existing dominance—transforming informal power into legally sanctioned
permanence. This dynamic is exemplified by the repeated tenure extensions pursued
by Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko.

In post-Soviet Russia, President Boris Yeltsin presided over the transformation
of a parliamentary system into a personalist regime. However, Yeltsin himself did
not overstay his term; instead, he designated Vladimir Putin as his successor.
Upon assuming office in 2000, Putin progressively entrenched his authority,
employing constitutional amendments and legal strategies to circumvent term
limits and extend his rule indefinitely.

Likewise, in Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko was elected president in 1994 under a
party-based system. Within a year, he dismantled the existing institutional
framework and established a personalist regime. Since then, he has remained in
power through successive tenure extensions, steadily consolidating his control
over the state apparatus.

In democratic contexts, autocoups are found exclusively in presidential systems.
This reflects the institutional leverage enjoyed by presidents, who are directly
elected, typically command the armed forces, and may possess the capacity to
override or circumvent legislative opposition. By contrast, prime ministers in
parliamentary systems are considerably more constrained. Their tenure depends on
maintaining legislative confidence and they may be removed through votes of no
confidence. Moreover, they often lack direct control over the military, which is
institutionally separated from their office. As a result, prime ministers are
subject to more frequent leadership turnover and face fewer opportunities to
unilaterally extend their mandates. For instance, the United Kingdom saw three
prime ministers serve in 2022 alone, while Japan has had 36 prime ministers since
1945—an average of one every two years. In contrast, only 14 presidents have
served in the United States over the same period, reflecting greater
institutional continuity. These structural distinctions render presidential
systems more conducive to autocoups—even within well-established democracies—due
to their centralised executive authority and command over the military.

From this analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:

The likelihood of autocoup attempts is significantly shaped by regime type, with
regimes characterised by concentrated and stable executive power—namely,
personalist autocracies and presidential democracies—being the most susceptible,
relative to other regime types.

### Research design

#### Methodology {.unnumbered}

Given the binary nature of the dependent variable—namely, whether an autocoup is
attempted in a given country-year—the study initially employs a logistic
regression model to investigate the determinants of autocoup attempts. This
method enables the identification of statistically significant factors
influencing the likelihood of such events, as well as the direction and magnitude
of their effects.

Nevertheless, the rarity of autocoup incidents—83 cases out of over 9,000
observations—poses a methodological challenge. Standard maximum likelihood
estimation techniques, including conventional logit and probit models, are prone
to underestimating the probability of rare events. To mitigate this limitation
and improve the robustness of statistical inference, the analysis also employs
Firth’s Bias-Reduced Penalised Maximum Likelihood Estimation (commonly referred
to as Bias-Reduced Logit), as outlined by @firth1993.

#### Data and variables {.unnumbered}

The primary dataset, which incorporates information on autocoups and regime
types, spans the period from 1945 to 2023. However, due to data alignment
limitations, the usable data range extends from 1945 to 2018. The dataset
comprises approximately 9,400 country-year observations, of which 83 represent
recorded autocoup attempts.

##### Dependent variable {.unnumbered}

The analysis draws upon the autocoup dataset introduced in Chapter 2, which
covers the period from 1945 to 2023 and includes 83 documented autocoup attempts.
Summary statistics for these events, as well as the corresponding regime
classifications, are presented in Chapter 2.

**Autocoup attempt**: A binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt
occurred (coded as 1) or did not occur (coded as 0) in each country-year
observation.

##### Independent variables {.unnumbered}

The principal independent variable in this analysis is regime type, reflecting
the central analytical focus of the study. Regime classifications are drawn from
the typology developed by @geddes2014 (GWF dataset), which distinguishes among
military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes within autocratic systems. For
democratic systems, regimes are categorised as either parliamentary or
presidential. A residual category—labelled “other”—captures regimes that are
provisional, transitional, or otherwise not easily classified within the primary
typology.

In addition to regime type, a range of control variables is included, selected on
the basis of established scholarship on the determinants of coups. These controls
account for factors such as economic performance, political violence, and the
tenure of incumbents. Further controls comprise the level of democracy,
population size, and a Cold War dummy variable, which captures temporal variation
in the global political environment.

**Economic Level:** Measured by GDP per capita, this variable reflects the
overall economic wellbeing of a country. Data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset
[@fariss2022] and are expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP, per
thousand).

**Economic Performance:** Operationalised via the Current-Trend (CT) ratio
developed by @krishnarajan2019, this measure compares current GDP per capita with
the average of the previous five years. Higher CT values indicate stronger
economic growth. Formally:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \over {1 \over 5} {\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}
    \end{aligned}
$$

**Political violence:** Measured using a violence index based on the “actotal”
variable from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset
[@marshall2005current], this index captures both internal and interstate
conflict. Scores range from 0 (complete stability) to 18 (maximum instability).

**Days in office (log):** The natural logarithm of an incumbent leader’s
cumulative days in office is included as a proxy for power consolidation. Longer
tenures are hypothesised to facilitate the conditions necessary for an autocoup.
Data are drawn from the Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political
Leaders’ Affiliation Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded].

**Democratic level:** This variable employs the Polity V score to measure the
degree of democracy in a country, ranging from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10
(fully democratic). The index, developed by the Center for Systemic Peace,
assesses regime characteristics such as the competitiveness of political
participation, executive recruitment, and constraints on executive authority
[@marshall].

**Population size:** The natural logarithm of a country’s population is included
to account for the potential effects of demographic scale on governance. Larger
populations may present more complex administrative challenges and generate
greater opposition. Data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset.

**Cold War:** Following the precedent of earlier studies [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023], a dummy variable is included to distinguish the
Cold War period (approximately 1960–1990) from the post-Cold War era. This
distinction reflects the relative paucity of autocoup events during the Cold War
and their increased frequency thereafter.

This analysis employs a logistic regression framework to investigate the factors
influencing the likelihood of autocoup attempts. Given the binary nature of the
dependent variable—namely, whether an autocoup attempt occurred in a given
country-year—and the relative infrequency of such events in certain categories, a
bias-reduced logit model is used alongside the standard logit model. The
bias-reduced approach is particularly appropriate for rare event data, as it
mitigates estimation bias associated with standard maximum likelihood techniques.
Accordingly, the discussion that follows focuses primarily on the results derived
from the bias-reduced logit model. These results are presented in the form of
Odds Ratios (ORs), which provide a more intuitive understanding of the
relationships between explanatory variables and the probability of autocoup
attempts than log-odds coefficients.

The estimates obtained from the bias-reduced logit model are summarised in
@tbl-autocoupmodel. The central hypothesis advanced in this study posits that the
likelihood of autocoup attempts is significantly shaped by regime type, with
personalist autocracies and presidential democracies being particularly prone to
such events in comparison with other regime types. The model adopts
"dominant-party" regimes as the reference category for comparison.

The findings offer strong empirical support for this hypothesis. Relative to
dominant-party regimes, personalist autocracies exhibit an estimated odds ratio
of 2.07, which is statistically significant (  $p<0.05$  ). This suggests that
the odds of an autocoup attempt are just over twice as high in personalist
autocracies, holding all other variables constant. Presidential democracies
demonstrate an even greater propensity for autocoup attempts, with an estimated
odds ratio of 4.83 (  $p<0.01$  ), indicating that the odds are nearly 3.8 times
higher than in dominant-party regimes, ceteris paribus. By contrast, military
regimes, parliamentary democracies, and regimes classified as "other" all exhibit
lower odds of experiencing an autocoup relative to dominant-party regimes. Among
these, only the “other” category reaches marginal statistical significance.

These results provide compelling evidence that both personalist autocracies and
presidential democracies are significantly more susceptible to autocoup attempts
than dominant-party regimes. The magnitude of the odds ratios for personalist
autocracies (2.07) and presidential democracies (4.83) is substantially greater
than for other regime types, thereby lending robust support to the central
hypothesis.

With respect to the control variables, several demonstrate statistically
significant relationships with the likelihood of autocoup attempts. The logged
Polity V score—reflecting the level of democratic institutionalisation—is
negatively associated with the probability of an autocoup (  $OR = 0.91$,
 $p<0.01$  ), suggesting that higher levels of democracy reduce the risk of such
occurrences. Similarly, the Cold War dummy variable is associated with a
significantly reduced likelihood of autocoup attempts (  $OR = 0.46$,  $p<0.01$
 ), indicating that these events were comparatively rarer during the Cold War
period. The natural logarithm of population size is marginally significant and
exhibits a negative association with autocoup likelihood, potentially reflecting
the greater organisational complexity and political constraints faced in more
populous states.

By contrast, several variables—including GDP per capita, economic performance (as
measured by the GDP growth trend ratio), political violence, and the logged
number of days the incumbent has been in office—do not exhibit statistically
significant associations with the likelihood of autocoup attempts in this model.

In sum, the bias-reduced logit model confirms that regime type is a critical
determinant of autocoup propensity. In line with the theoretical expectations,
personalist autocracies and presidential democracies are significantly more
vulnerable to autocoup attempts than dominant-party regimes or other regime
types. These findings underscore the institutional fragility inherent in such
systems, particularly in contexts where executive authority is highly
centralised. The analysis also highlights the relevance of broader political and
historical factors, including democratic development and the Cold War period, in
shaping the incidence of autocoup events.

### Summary

This chapter offers a quantitative examination of the determinants of autocoup
attempts, addressing a well-documented lacuna in the existing literature, which
has often been impeded by conceptual ambiguity and a lack of systematic empirical
data. The study advances the argument that the likelihood of autocoup attempts is
significantly influenced by the structural distribution of power within political
regimes, operationalised through regime type. Drawing on both standard logistic
regression and Firth’s bias-reduced logit model, the analysis demonstrates that
personalist autocracies and presidential democracies are substantially more prone
to autocoup attempts than dominant-party regimes. Specifically, the odds of an
autocoup are estimated to be approximately three times higher in personalist
autocracies and four times higher in presidential democracies, relative to the
reference category.

These findings offer empirical support for the hypothesis that such regime types
possess structural vulnerabilities that render them particularly susceptible to
extra-constitutional power consolidation by incumbents. In addition to regime
type, the study identifies further significant covariates: population size, the
degree of democratisation, and the broader historical context of the Cold War
period all exert measurable influence on the probability of autocoup occurrence.
By analysing the strategic incentives faced by incumbent leaders across different
institutional configurations, this research contributes to a more comprehension
understanding of irregular leader transitions.

Nonetheless, the analysis also highlights conceptual and methodological
complexities that merit further scholarly attention. Unlike traditional
coups—which may occur at any point during a regime's lifespan and can potentially
recur within short intervals—autocoups appear to follow distinct temporal logics.
For example, the likelihood of an autocoup may be lower during the early stages
of a leader’s tenure and increase as the end of a constitutional term approaches.
Moreover, while successful tenure extensions may reduce the short-term likelihood
of further attempts, instances of repeated extensions—such as those undertaken by
Presidents Putin and Lukashenko—indicate that some incumbents may engage in
multiple autocoups over time.

To render the analysis tractable, this study adopts the simplifying assumption
that an autocoup attempt occurs only once per leadership tenure. While
analytically necessary, this assumption underscores the need for future research
to investigate the temporal dynamics and sequencing of autocoup behaviour. Such
inquiries would usefully complement the present study by offering deeper insight
into the longitudinal patterns and institutional adaptations that shape
authoritarian resilience and democratic backsliding.

## Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival: A Comparative Analysis of Coup-installed and Autocoup Leaders

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter investigates the impact of power acquisition methods on the tenure
of political leaders who assume office through irregular means, with a particular
focus on individuals installed via coups and those who subsequently extend their
rule through autocoups. It posits that leaders who consolidate their authority
through autocoups are likely to enjoy greater longevity in office than those
installed by coups alone. However, this hypothesis is not supported by the
empirical evidence. A time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model indicates no
statistically significant difference in the risk of removal between
coup-installed and autocoup leaders once key covariates—especially regime
type—are taken into account.

Rather, the analysis underscores the critical role of regime characteristics in
shaping leadership survival. Leaders operating within military or transitional
regimes are found to face significantly higher hazards of removal compared to
their counterparts in dominant-party systems. Furthermore, higher levels of GDP
per capita are associated with increased leadership stability, while greater
levels of political violence correspond with elevated risks of ousting.

These findings suggest that structural and institutional contexts exert a
stronger influence on the durability of irregular leadership than the specific
mechanism through which power is initially acquired. This study contributes to
the literature on political survival by highlighting the significance of regime
type and broader political conditions in accounting for leadership longevity
following non-conventional ascensions to power.

### Introduction

The enduring question of why some political leaders remain in power for decades
while others are deposed within months or even days has long captivated scholars
in political science. Despite the considerable body of research on leadership
longevity, a particular subset of leaders—those who assume power through coups or
consolidate it via autocoups—has received comparatively limited scholarly
attention. Investigating the tenures of these leaders is essential, as it
illuminates the dynamics underpinning irregular transitions of power and their
broader implications for political stability and democratic governance.

Leaders who rise through irregular means, such as coups and autocoups, differ
markedly from those who attain office via institutionalised, constitutional
processes. These irregular leaders often pose more complex analytical challenges,
given the uncertainties surrounding their authority and legitimacy. Data from the
Archigos dataset underscores the prevalence of such irregular transitions:
between 1945 and 2015, more than half of the leaders who entered power
irregularly also exited through irregular means—a rate considerably higher than
that observed for leaders who entered office through regular procedures
[@goemans2009].

Coup-installed and autocoup leaders comprise a significant proportion of these
irregular cases. According to Archigos, 246 of the 374 leaders ( $65.8\%$ ) who
exited power irregularly were removed via coups [@goemans2009]. Additionally,
research by @frantz2016 shows that coups constitute approximately one-third of
all exits in autocracies, representing the most common form of leadership
transition in such regimes. Complementing this, the autocoup dataset introduced
in Chapter 2 documents 83 autocoup attempts between 1945 and 2023, of which 64
were successful.

```

Assessing the tenure of coup-installed and autocoup leaders presents
methodological challenges due to the inherent volatility and uncertainty of their
positions. Nonetheless, comparative evidence—excluding short-lived leaders who
remained in office for fewer than 180 days—suggests that those who extend their
rule through autocoups tend to experience longer average post-autocoup tenures
(approximately `r avg$avg[2]` years) than those who initially assume power via
coups (approximately `r avg$avg[1]` years), indicating a potential tenure gap of
around 3 years.

```

Preliminary survival analysis, using a log-rank test illustrated in Figure
@fig-logrank, reveals a statistically significant difference in tenure length
between these two groups. The survival curve for autocoup leaders consistently
lies above that of coup-installed leaders, suggesting both a lower hazard of
removal and longer durations in office for the former.

This study posits that the method of power acquisition exerts a significant
influence on leadership survival. Coup-installed leaders may encounter greater
resistance or institutional fragility, contributing to shorter average tenures
than those who consolidate power through autocoups. Employing Cox proportional
hazards and time-dependent Cox models, the analysis supports this hypothesis by
demonstrating that autocoup leaders tend to remain in office longer than their
coup-installed counterparts.

This research makes two key contributions to the literature on political
survival. First, it introduces an under-explored explanatory factor: the method
of accession to power. Second, by applying survival models, this study provides
robust empirical evidence of the significant disparity in tenure length between
autocoup and coup-installed leaders. These insights may help account for the
rising incidence of autocoup-driven tenure extensions since 2000, as incumbents
increasingly observe and emulate successful precedents.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the
existing literature on political survival, establishing the theoretical context
for the analysis. Section 3 examines the factors influencing the longevity of
coup-installed and autocoup leaders. Section 4 details the methodological
approach and data sources, including the application of survival analysis
techniques. Section 5 presents the empirical findings and interprets their
implications. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding reflections and considers the
broader consequences of the findings for political stability and democratic
development.

### Literature review

The longevity of political leaders, which varies markedly across regimes,
countries, and historical periods, has long been a focal point of inquiry within
political science. Research in this field is generally categorised into two
interrelated strands: regime survival and individual leader survival. While the
former concerns the endurance of political systems—such as monarchies, dominant
parties, or ideological frameworks—the latter focuses on the duration of
individual leaders’ tenure in office.

Patterns of political survival differ significantly across regime types. For
instance, parliamentary democracies (e.g., Japan and the United Kingdom) often
witness sustained party dominance alongside frequent leadership turnover.
Similarly, communist regimes (e.g., China) are typically characterised by stable
party control but relatively frequent changes in leadership. In contrast,
presidential systems (e.g., the United States) and many military regimes tend to
exhibit more frequent changes in both leadership and ruling entity.

The existing literature on leader survival is both extensive and diverse. Some
studies investigate mechanisms that influence leadership durability within
specific regime types, such as democracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies
[@davenport2021]. Others attempt to formulate more general theoretical frameworks
applicable across various political systems [@buenodemesquita2003]. Despite these
efforts, the ambition of constructing a universal theory of leadership survival
remains elusive due to the inherent complexities across regime contexts.

Mechanisms of leadership transition vary substantially between democracies and
autocracies. In autocratic regimes, leadership selection processes are often
closed, with access restricted to a limited elite. Even when elections are held,
meaningful competition is frequently constrained by structural or legal barriers.
The opacity of leadership transitions in autocracies complicates assessments of
popular support and renders concepts such as selectorates or winning coalitions,
as theorised by @buenodemesquita2003, difficult to operationalise.

Given these challenges, focusing research on specific categories of leaders may
yield more analytically fruitful outcomes. The study of irregular leaders—those
who ascend to power via coups or extend their rule through autocoups—offers a
compelling line of inquiry due to the distinctive uncertainty and volatility that
characterise their tenures.

Two dominant perspectives have emerged in the literature to explain leader
survival. The first emphasises objective structural factors and material
resources, such as individual competence [@yu2016], societal stability
[@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999; @williams2011], natural
resource wealth [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012; @wright2013], and external
support [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017]. The second perspective focuses on
subjective dimensions and strategic choices, including policy decisions,
management of opposition, and mechanisms for consolidating authority
[@gandhi2007; @morrison2009; @escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].

Coups, a critical form of irregular leadership transition, have garnered
substantial scholarly attention. Research has examined strategies for coup
prevention [@powell2017; @sudduth2017; @debruin2020], as well as the effects of
coups on leadership trajectories and the subsequent behaviour of coup leaders
[@sudduth2017; @sudduth2018; @easton2018].

Despite this body of work, a significant lacuna remains in the comparative
analysis of leadership survival between coup-installed and autocoup leaders. This
study seeks to address this gap by examining and comparing the tenure lengths of
leaders emerging from these two distinct forms of irregular power acquisition.

By centring its analysis on the survival of coup-installed versus autocoup
leaders, this research aims to enhance our understanding of political longevity
in the context of irregular leadership transitions. Such a focus promises to
yield important insights into the strategic and structural conditions that
underpin leadership durability in diverse political environments.

### Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-installed leaders

The study of leadership survival within political systems poses significant
methodological and conceptual challenges, owing to the opaque and complex nature
of power transitions. These very challenges, however, underscore the importance
of such inquiry, as it illuminates the often-neglected dynamics of political
leadership. While the survival trajectories of individual leaders vary
considerably, discernible patterns can be identified. Leaders emerging from
similar origins or operating within comparable regime types frequently display
analogous characteristics, thereby enabling systematic and meaningful comparative
analysis.

#### Key definitions and scope

Prior to undertaking a comparative analysis, it is essential to establish clear
definitions of key terms to ensure conceptual clarity and analytical coherence.
The definitions employed in this chapter align with those presented in Chapter 2.

Autocoup leaders are defined as incumbent rulers who utilise extra-constitutional
measures to prolong their tenure in office. In contrast, coup-installed leaders
are those who ascend to power following a successful coup, irrespective of
whether they personally orchestrated or participated in the coup. This inclusive
definition encompasses both coup perpetrators and individuals subsequently
appointed to lead, thereby offering a comprehensive perspective on leadership
following violent or forceful regime change.

Three clarifications are warranted in delineating the analytical scope. First is
about the minimum tenure threshold. To facilitate a meaningful and robust
analysis, the study imposes a minimum threshold of six months in office for both
autocoup and coup-installed leaders. This criterion serves to exclude brief or
interim leadership episodes that are less analytically relevant to the study of
survival dynamics, thereby enhancing the reliability of the findings.

Second is the potential overlap in leadership categories. Some cases may present
ambiguities due to overlapping leadership pathways. A notable example is Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali, who assumed the presidency of Tunisia in 1987 following a
bloodless coup that removed President Habib Bourguiba on grounds of ill health.
In 2002, Ben Ali further consolidated power through a constitutional referendum
that removed term limits and raised the presidential age cap from 70 to 75 years
[@bonci2019]. This latter manoeuvre could be construed as an autocoup.
Nevertheless, since Ben Ali initially came to power via the 1987 coup and
remained in office continuously, he is classified in this study as a
coup-installed leader. To preserve analytical consistency and prevent category
overlap, this study adopts the rule that any leader who initially acquires office
through a coup is categorised as coup-installed, even if they later consolidate
or extend their rule through elections or extra-constitutional means.

Third is the focus on post-event tenure. The analysis compares the post-autocoup
tenure of autocoup leaders with the post-coup tenure of coup-installed leaders.
Any period served by autocoup leaders prior to the tenure-extending manoeuvre is
excluded. This approach ensures a like-for-like comparison by focusing on the
period of leadership characterised by irregular legitimacy and heightened
political uncertainty. Both categories of leaders share key characteristics—such
as limited institutional legitimacy, increased exposure to instability, and
dependence on coercive or extra-legal mechanisms—which render the comparison
analytically fruitful.

#### Challenges in power consolidation

Both autocoup and coup-installed leaders encounter distinct challenges in
consolidating power, largely arising from the differing intensity of issues
related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. These disparities create
an uneven political landscape, placing coup-installed leaders at a marked
disadvantage. @tbl-leaders presents a comparative overview of the principal
characteristics of autocoup and coup-installed leaders, highlighting these
critical differences.

  )

\elandscape

##### Illegitimacy {.unnumbered}

Although both categories of leaders face legitimacy deficits, the nature and
perception of this deficit vary considerably.

For coup-installed leaders, illegitimacy is overt and unequivocal, stemming from
the direct—often violent—seizure of power. Such abrupt disruptions to established
political norms and institutions elicit immediate condemnation, both domestically
and internationally, and cast doubt on the regime's authority from the outset.

By contrast, autocoup leaders adopt a more covert and strategic approach,
utilising legal and institutional mechanisms to simulate democratic legitimacy.
Though often superficial, this legalistic veneer can obscure the authoritarian
nature of their actions, offering a temporary shield from domestic opposition and
international scrutiny while they seek to consolidate power.

##### Uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The irregular accession of both types of leaders generates uncertainty regarding
the durability of their rule and the modalities of succession. However, the
nature and sources of this uncertainty differ markedly.

Coup-installed leaders confront a triad of uncertainties. First, the immediate
post-coup environment frequently involves intense power struggles within the
military or ruling coalition, creating ambiguity over who will ultimately
prevail. Second, their tenure is intrinsically unstable, threatened by internal
rivalries, popular mobilisation, or the prospect of counter-coups. Third, the
absence of institutionalised succession mechanisms exacerbates this
unpredictability, heightening the risk of future instability.

Autocoup leaders, while not entirely insulated from uncertainty, typically face
fewer ambiguities. As incumbents, they retain formal authority post-autocoup,
thereby eliminating immediate succession questions. Moreover, autocoup leaders
often articulate explicit ambitions to prolong their rule indefinitely, or
through gradual extensions, cultivating an image of continuity. This perceived
stability—whether genuine or contrived—may foster a more predictable political
climate in the short term.

##### Instability {.unnumbered}

The combination of legitimacy deficits and enduring uncertainty inevitably
fosters insecurity and a sense of political fragility. Consequently, both
autocoup and coup-installed leaders prioritise strategies to stabilise their
regimes. However, the scale and nature of these challenges differ.

Coup-installed leaders typically face the formidable task of reconfiguring
political power from the ground up. This often involves purging opponents,
suppressing dissent, and restructuring institutional frameworks. Such aggressive
measures can provoke significant resistance, alienate potential allies, and
incite societal unrest. Moreover, the imperative to appease powerful domestic and
international actors may force these leaders into precarious compromises that
further undermine their authority.

In contrast, autocoup leaders often benefit from a degree of institutional
continuity and regime loyalty. This relative stability enables them to pursue
consolidation incrementally, reducing the likelihood of immediate backlash. While
opposition may persist, autocoup leaders are generally less exposed to
existential threats in the early stages of their extended rule, affording them
greater latitude to entrench their authority.

Understanding these contrasting challenges allows for a more refined appreciation
of the strategic environments in which irregular leaders operate. This
comparative lens provides a valuable framework for analysing the divergent
pathways to power consolidation, and the varied tools and tactics employed by
autocoup and coup-installed leaders in navigating the precarious terrain of
non-traditional political ascension.

#### Empirical evidence and hypothesis

Empirical evidence underscores the relative disadvantage faced by coup-installed
leaders, revealing a complex interplay between historical patterns, difficulties
in consolidating power, and variations in leadership longevity. This section
presents key empirical findings and introduces the central hypothesis that guides
this study.

Data analysis indicates a strong correlation between the frequency of coup
attempts within a given country and the likelihood of future coups. Notably, more
than one-third of all coups since 1950 have taken place in the ten countries with
the highest number of coup attempts [@powell2011]. This suggests a
self-reinforcing cycle of political instability, in which each successful coup
increases the probability of further attempts, thereby cultivating an environment
of persistent uncertainty for coup-installed leaders.

The disparity in leadership duration between autocoup and coup-installed leaders
is clearly reflected in survival data. As illustrated in @fig-logrank, leaders
who extend their tenure through autocoups remain in office, on average,
approximately five years longer than those who assume power via coups. This
marked difference in tenure highlights the distinct challenges these two
categories of leaders encounter in retaining power.

The divergent consolidation environments faced by autocoup and coup-installed
leaders contribute to a self-perpetuating cycle with significant implications for
tenure length. Coup-installed leaders confront acute legitimacy deficits and
heightened internal instability; they often struggle to attract and retain
durable support, rendering them more susceptible to both internal dissent and
external pressures. Their comparatively shorter average tenures reinforce
perceptions of volatility and fragility. Autocoup leaders, by contrast,
frequently benefit from a superficial veneer of legality and enjoy a more
favourable starting position as incumbents. This allows them to consolidate
authority more effectively, cultivate elite and public support, and reduce the
immediate risk of displacement. Their longer tenures further contribute to
perceptions of regime stability. This cyclical dynamic suggests that the initial
method of acquiring or extending power has long-term implications for a leader’s
capacity to maintain their position.

Drawing upon these empirical observations and the theoretical framework outlined
in preceding sections, the following hypothesis is proposed:

***H4-1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups
are more likely to enjoy longer extended tenures than those who assume office
through coups.***

This hypothesis encapsulates the anticipated effects of the differing challenges
and advantages faced by coup-installed and autocoup leaders. By empirically
testing this claim, the study seeks to assess the impact of irregular accession
mechanisms on leadership survival, thereby advancing a more nuanced understanding
of political durability in contexts of non-traditional transitions to power.

### Research design

This section outlines the methodological framework employed to test the
hypothesis that autocoup leaders exhibit longer survival times in office than
coup-installed leaders. Survival analysis is utilised to model leadership tenure,
with Cox proportional hazards models employed to estimate the effects of leader
type while controlling for relevant covariates.

#### Methodology: Survival analysis

Two variants of the Cox model are employed to analyse the survival durations of
coup-installed and autocoup leaders.

**Cox proportional hazards (PH) model**: This model incorporates only
time-invariant covariates measured at the time of the leader’s entry into office.
It assumes that the effects of these covariates on the hazard rate remain
constant over time.

**Time-dependent Cox model**: This model allows for the inclusion of covariates
whose values may vary over time, such as indicators of economic performance and
levels of political violence. By incorporating temporal variation, this model
offers a more dynamic and nuanced analysis of leadership survival.

The Cox model is preferred over the Kaplan-Meier estimator due to its capacity to
account for multiple explanatory variables simultaneously. Although the Cox model
does not directly estimate the expected duration of tenure, it estimates the
hazard ratio, which reflects the relative risk of being removed from office. A
higher cumulative hazard corresponds to a lower probability of survival, thereby
capturing critical dynamics of leadership vulnerability over time.

#### Data and variables

The analysis relies on a set of dependent and independent variables, complemented
by a range of controls.

**Survival Time:** Measured in days, this variable captures the length of a
leader’s tenure. For coup-installed leaders, the tenure is measured from the date
of their accession via coup. For autocoup leaders, it begins on the date their
original legitimate term would have expired. For instance, Vladimir Putin assumed
the presidency of Russia in 2000, stepped down in 2008 after completing two
terms, and assumed the post of prime minister while continuing to exert de facto
control. His post-autocoup tenure, therefore, is coded as beginning in 2008.

**End Point Status:** This categorical variable indicates how a leader’s tenure
ended:

-   **0 = Censored:** Denotes leaders who exited office through regular or
    voluntary means, such as electoral defeat, term expiration, voluntary
    resignation due to health, or natural death.

-   **1 = Ousted:** Denotes leaders who were forcibly removed, including through
    coups, resignations under pressure, or assassination.

The key independent variable is the leader type, which categorizes leaders into
two distinct groups:

-   **Group A = Autocoup leader**: An incumbent who extends their tenure through
    extra-constitutional means.
-   **Group B = Coup-installed leader**: A leader who assumes power through a
    coup, whether or not they personally participated in its execution.

This variable serves as the primary explanatory factor, enabling a direct
comparison of survival outcomes between the two categories of irregular leaders.

Data for the dependent and independent variables are drawn from the newly
constructed autocoup dataset introduced in this study, as well as the Archigos
dataset and the Political Leaders and Alliances Dataset (PLAD).

To isolate the effect of leader type on survival, the analysis incorporates a set
of control variables, as identified in the autocoup analysis presented in Chapter
3. These include: regime type which is categorised as democracy, hybrid regime,
or autocracy, to account for institutional differences that may influence
leadership stability; economic performance, measured through macroeconomic
indicators such as GDP growth, which may affect a leader’s ability to retain
support; political violence, captures the extent of civil conflict, repression,
or unrest, which can threaten regime stability and leadership tenure; population
size, controls for structural differences across states that may impact political
dynamics; Polity V scores, feflects the institutional characteristics and degree
of democracy or autocracy within a regime.

These control variables enhance the comparability and robustness of the
statistical models, ensuring that the estimated effects of leader type are not
confounded by broader political, economic, or demographic conditions.

The two models yield divergent findings concerning the central question of this
study. The Cox PH model reveals a marginally statistically significant
relationship between leadership type and the hazard of removal from office (
$p < 0.1$ ). Specifically, this model supports the hypothesis that leaders
installed through coups face a 1.78 times greater hazard of removal compared to
those who came to power via autocoups. However, the time-dependent Cox model,
which incorporates time-varying covariates such as economic performance and
political violence, does not find a statistically significant relationship
between leadership type and survival in office. Given the greater robustness of
the time-dependent specification, the interpretation of the principal findings is
grounded in this model.

According to the time-dependent Cox model, and contrary to the initial hypothesis
and preliminary results, the mode of accession to power does not significantly
influence the tenure of irregularly inaugurated political leaders once relevant
covariates—particularly regime type—are controlled for. Nevertheless, these
results reinforce the broader conclusion of Chapter 3: that the balance of power,
fundamentally shaped by regime characteristics, is central to both the seizure
and retention of political authority.

In particular, regime type emerges as a statistically significant determinant of
political survival. Leaders in military regimes exhibit a hazard ratio of 2.06
relative to their counterparts in dominant-party regimes, suggesting that
military leaders are significantly more likely to be ousted. This implies that,
all else being equal, a military leader faces a $106\%$ greater risk of removal
at any given point compared to a leader within a dominant-party regime. Leaders
operating within regimes classified as “Other”—typically encompassing
transitional or provisional arrangements—display an even higher hazard ratio of
2.57, consistent with the inherent volatility of such political configurations.

Economic development, proxied by GDP per capita, also exerts a statistically
significant influence. A hazard ratio of 0.95 indicates that each additional
\$10,000 in GDP per capita is associated with a $5\%$ reduction in the risk of
removal, ceteris paribus. Conversely, political violence, measured via the
violence index, demonstrates a positive relationship with leader removal: a
one-unit increase in the index raises the hazard of removal by approximately
$9\%$.

Other control variables—including GDP growth, the logarithm of population size,
and Polity V scores—do not reach statistical significance in the time-dependent
Cox model. Although these factors are theoretically salient and frequently
employed in studies of political survival, their lack of significance in this
context suggests that, under conditions of irregular leadership transitions, more
immediate variables such as regime type and political violence may play a more
decisive role. It is plausible that the effects of structural economic growth,
demographic scale, and institutional quality are either mediated through more
proximate mechanisms or unfold over longer time horizons, rendering them less
visible in short- to medium-term analyses of leader tenure.

It is important to note that the results are contingent upon the exclusion of
very short-lived leaders—those who remained in office for fewer than 180 days
following a coup or autocoup. A significant number of coup-installed leaders
survive only for brief periods—often mere days or months—a phenomenon that is
comparatively rare among autocoup leaders. Consequently, the exclusion criterion
introduces a slight bias in favour of coup-installed leaders. Nevertheless, this
study contends that the inclusion of such short-lived tenures would be
methodologically inappropriate. Although these leaders technically meet the
minimal threshold for a successful coup (i.e., retaining power for more than
seven days), their failure to consolidate authority suggests they did not truly
succeed in establishing post-coup rule in a meaningful or sustained manner.

@fig-coxHR illustrates the hazard ratios and their associated 95% confidence
intervals for the variables included in the Cox proportional hazards model. The
proximity of each hazard ratio (represented by a dot) to 1 denotes minimal effect
on the risk of removal from office; a hazard ratio of 1 indicates no effect. The
horizontal lines denote the $95\%$ confidence intervals, and variables whose
intervals cross the vertical reference line at 1 are not statistically
significant at the $5\%$ level.

As previously discussed, the hazard ratios for leaders in military regimes and
“Other” regimes are both substantially above 1 and statistically significant at
the $5\%$ level, confirming their heightened vulnerability to removal. GDP per
capita also attains statistical significance, albeit with a hazard ratio very
close to 1, indicating a relatively modest substantive effect.

Although the hazard ratios for GDP growth and regime type (e.g., presidential or
parliamentary) appear visually distant from 1, their respective confidence
intervals intersect the vertical line, indicating a lack of statistical
significance at conventional thresholds.

Most other variables display hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting that marginal
changes in these predictors do not substantially alter the likelihood of
political removal for leaders emerging from coups or autocoups.

#### Assessing the proportional hazards assumption

Evaluating the proportional hazards assumption is essential to ensure the
validity of the Cox model estimates. This assumption was tested using a
chi-squared test based on Schoenfeld residuals, which assesses whether the
effects of covariates remain constant over time. The results indicate that
neither the standard Cox PH model nor the time-dependent Cox model violates this
assumption. The global p-values—0.12 for the standard model and 0.23 for the
time-dependent model—exceed the conventional $5\%$ significance threshold,
thereby confirming that the proportional hazards assumption holds in both cases.

### Summary

This chapter has examined the survival durations of political leaders who assumed
office through irregular means—specifically coups and autocoups—by employing
survival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a
time-dependent Cox model. While the standard Cox model indicated a marginally
significant difference in the risk of removal between autocoup and coup-installed
leaders, this association did not attain statistical significance in the
time-dependent model, which offers a more rigorous specification by accounting
for time-varying covariates.

The findings suggest that, once regime type and other pertinent covariates are
controlled for, the method of accession—whether via coup or autocoup—does not
independently determine leader survival. Rather, regime type emerges as a key
determinant. Leaders operating within military or transitional (“other”) regimes
face significantly higher risks of removal than those in dominant-party systems.
Furthermore, economic development, as measured by GDP per capita, and political
violence significantly influence tenure length, whereas GDP growth, population
size, and democratic quality (as captured by Polity V scores) do not exhibit
statistically significant effects.

These results reinforce the central argument that institutional
context—particularly regime characteristics—plays a more decisive role in shaping
political longevity than the initial method of seizing power. This conclusion is
consistent with earlier qualitative assessments and underscores the importance of
integrating institutional and structural variables into analyses of political
survival.

Methodologically, the chapter illustrates the utility of time-dependent modelling
in political science, particularly where covariates evolve over time. It also
contributes to the emerging literature on autocoups by offering one of the first
systematic empirical assessments of their implications for political survival.
However, reliance on a newly constructed dataset for autocoups introduces certain
limitations, underscoring the need for further refinement and expansion in future
research.

In sum, this chapter provides empirical evidence supporting the proposition that
regime characteristics, more than the mode of accession alone, shape the
durability of irregular political leadership. These insights contribute to
broader debates on authoritarian resilience, democratic backsliding, and the
institutional foundations of political authority.

## Coups, Autocoups, and Democracy

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter explores the impact of autocoups on political institutions, drawing
comparisons with traditional coups through an analysis of changes in Polity
scores. I contend that, first, incumbent leaders frequently consolidate power by
undermining established institutions in anticipation of an autocoup, resulting in
a decline in Polity scores even prior to the event. Second, unlike coups, which
produce mixed outcomes regarding democratization, autocoups almost invariably
lead to democratic backsliding or authoritarian entrenchment, as they are
specifically designed to dismantle institutional checks, enabling leaders to
maintain power for significantly longer periods than those installed via coups.

Employing a country-fixed effects model and utilizing datasets on both autocoups
and coups, this study reveals that Polity scores decline both preceding and
following an autocoup, while coups tend to trigger an immediate decrease that may
allow for some degree of democratic recovery over time. These findings underscore
the divergent political trajectories associated with coups and autocoups. This
research not only addresses a critical gap in the empirical analysis of autocoups
but also significantly raises awareness within academic and policy-making circles
regarding their potential adverse effects, including democratic backsliding and
further authoritarian deterioration.

### Introduction

In the preceding chapters, I clarified the definition of an autocoup, introduced
a novel dataset on autocoups, conducted empirical analyses on the determinants of
autocoup attempts, and compared the post-event survival times of leaders
established through coups versus autocoup leaders. A natural follow-up question
emerges: What are the broader impacts of autocoups? Specifically, from a
political science perspective, how do autocoups affect the process of
democratization?

As previously noted, due to the absence of a widely recognized dataset on
autocoups, most existing discussions on their impact have relied on case studies
[@baturo; @baturo2022]. To move beyond case-specific analyses and adopt a more
systematic and comparative approach, this chapter aims to pioneer empirical
research on the democratic consequences of autocoups. The first objective of this
chapter, therefore, is to examine whether autocoups reinforce authoritarianism,
promote democratization, or have no significant effect on political regimes.

Given the conceptual and empirical connections between coups and autocoups,
another key objective is to compare their respective effects on democratization.
While both events disrupt existing political orders, their immediate and
long-term consequences may vary significantly. Understanding these distinctions
is essential for evaluating their broader implications.

To address these questions, this study leverages data from a widely recognized
coup dataset alongside a newly compiled dataset on autocoups. Employing a
fixed-effects model, it evaluates their effects on democracy, as measured by the
Polity Index. The findings reveal that both coups and autocoups lead to an
immediate decline in democratic levels. However, coups have a more pronounced
negative short-term impact. Notably, three years after these events, democracies
affected by coups tend to show significant recovery, whereas those experiencing
autocoups exhibit no meaningful improvement.

This study offers two significant contributions to the field of political
science. First, it provides the inaugural empirical analysis of the impact of
autocoups on democratization, effectively addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature. Second, by directly comparing the effects of coups and
autocoups, this research highlights autocoups as a distinct phenomenon that
demands increased scholarly inquiry and policy focus.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 analyzes the
impact of autocoups on democratization, by comparing the effects with traditional
coups. Section 3 outlines the research design, methodology, and variables used in
this study. Section 4 presents and interprets the empirical findings, followed by
a discussion of their implications. Finally, Section 5 concludes by summarizing
the key results and exploring their significance for understanding and mitigating
the occurrence of autocoups.

### Impact of autocoups on political change

According to the definition in Chapter 2, an autocoup refers to an incumbent
leader extending their tenure in power beyond the originally mandated limits,
whether through legal or illegal means. While the leader may assume a different
title or position, the individual in power remains unchanged. Therefore, unlike
traditional coups, an autocoup does not result in real leadership turnover, elite
restructuring, or regime change. In other words, the fundamental ruling structure
remains intact.

This distinction has important implications. Since regime change rarely occurs
following an autocoup, its impact on politics cannot be assessed using
conventional methods. Typically, studies on coups and democratization measure
their effects by estimating the probability of regime transition—either from
autocracy to democracy or vice versa—as seen in previous research on coup
outcomes [@thyne2014; @derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016]. However, this approach is
not suitable for autocoups, as they do not directly trigger regime transfers.

Although autocoups rarely lead to formal regime change, this does not mean they
have no impact on political dynamics. In fact, they inevitably shape political
trajectories in various ways and, on occasion, can even lead to significant
transformations. Therefore, a more appropriate method for assessing the political
impact of autocoups is to analyze democratic indices, such as those measured by
Polity5 [@p1]. The Polity Score, ranging from -10 (full autocracy) to +10 (full
democracy), captures gradual shifts in political regime characteristics rather
than abrupt transitions. Thus, even if an autocoup does not result in a formal
regime change, subtle shifts in political openness and institutional constraints
can still be assessed by examining variations in Polity scores before and after
the event. This approach has also been employed in previous studies [@dahl2023].

Although autocoups may not lead to significant regime change, their impact on
democratization should not be overlooked. However, their influence differs from
that of traditional coups in at least two key ways.

#### **The pre-emptive effects of autocoups on political dynamics**

First and foremost, unlike coups, which are marked by clear, decisive events—such
as the removal of a leader—autocoups typically unfold gradually, through
incremental steps rather than a singular, dramatic event. Incumbent leaders
seeking to extend their tenure often lay the groundwork well in advance before
executing their final move to remain in power. To reduce resistance and
opposition, they engage in extensive preparation, which may include purging
officials, suppressing political opposition, cracking down on dissent and
protests, and restricting press freedom. Without such measures, an autocoup might
face strong internal resistance, and in the worst case, provoke a backlash that
not only derails the leader’s attempt to extend their rule but also results in
their immediate removal from office.

However, once an incumbent successfully secures an extension of their rule,
continued repression is not always necessary. On the contrary, some leaders relax
political pressure to ease internal dissent and mitigate opposition from external
actors. This adaptive approach helps maintain stability after the autocoup is
complete.

As a result, the primary impact of autocoups on political change is often
reflected in shifts in political scores before the final stage of the autocoup is
enacted. Once the process is completed, further shifts may be minimal. In
contrast, coup plotters, unlike incumbents, lack the ability to influence
political institutions beforehand, meaning their impact on politics is often felt
in the aftermath rather than before the event.

This distinction is evident in empirical cases of autocoups.

One of the most frequently cited examples of an autocoup is Peru’s 1992 case, in
which President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the
1979 Constitution, and ruled by decree until November of that year, when a
*Democratic Constituent Congress* was elected to draft a new constitution
[@cameron1998]. However, these moves did not immediately grant Fujimori a longer
tenure in office.

Under the 1979 Peruvian Constitution, immediate presidential re-election was
prohibited. To bypass this restriction, Fujimori initiated a constitutional
overhaul, leading to the adoption of a new constitution in 1993, which permitted
re-election. Consequently, he secured a second term in 1995 [@baturo2019].

An analysis of Peru’s Polity5 scores during this process reflects these political
changes. Upon taking office in 1990, Peru’s Polity score was 8, remaining
unchanged in 1991. However, a dramatic shift occurred in 1992, when Fujimori
dissolved Congress, causing the Polity score to plummet from 8 to -4.
Interestingly, when he formally extended his rule by amending the constitution in
1993, the score rebounded slightly to -1. This -1 score remained unchanged
throughout Fujimori’s tenure until 2000, indicating a lack of further
institutional transformation after the constitutional amendment.

A similar pattern emerges in Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko. Upon assuming
office as president in 1994, Belarus had a Polity5 score of 8. However, in 1995,
when Lukashenko moved to hold a referendum—defying opposition in the Supreme
Council and threatening to suspend its activities—the score dropped sharply to 0.
Following the 1996 referendum, which extended his term by two additional years,
Lukashenko officially overstayed his tenure. Consequently, the Polity5 score
further declined to -7 in 1996, where it has remained ever since, despite two
additional term extensions [@ash2014; @baturo].

These cases illustrate a broader pattern: the impact of autocoups on political
change is often reflected before the final stage of the autocoup is enacted,
whereas the impact of coups tends to materialize afterwards, as have been fully
discussed by previous studies.

Based on this analysis, I propose the first hypothesis:

> *H1*: Autocoups primarily shape political change in advance, whereas coups
> typically drive political change only after they are executed.

#### **The singular nature of autocoups**

Secondly, in contrast to the ambiguous nature of coups [@dahl2023], the impact of
autocoups on political change rarely contributes to democratization.

The influence of coups on democratization has been extensively examined in
existing literature. Some scholars argue that coups—and even the mere threat of
them—can act as catalysts for democratization. One argument suggests that coups
deliver a political "shock" that may create opportunities for liberalization that
would not have otherwise materialized [@thyne2014]. In a critical examination,
@derpanopoulos2016 questioned the role of coups in promoting democracy, engaging
in multiple rounds of debate with @miller2016. More recently, @dahl2023 further
explored this ongoing discussion, arguing that both democratic and autocratic
transitions are likely to follow a coup, with popular mobilization playing a
decisive role in shaping post-coup trajectories.

A frequently cited example of a “pro-democracy coup” occurred in February 2010,
when Nigerien troops ousted President Mamadou Tandja after he extended his rule
autocratically. The Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD) took
control, pledging democratic reforms. Their actions were widely celebrated, with
both citizens and political opposition viewing the coup as an opportunity to
restore democracy. The CSRD fulfilled its commitment by overseeing free and fair
elections in 2011, resulting in Mahamadou Issoufou assuming the presidency
[@miller2016].

While the debate on the democratic consequences of coups remains ongoing, it is
evident that their impact is not uniform. In contrast, autocoups almost never
lead to democratic transitions, nor do they even marginally enhance political
freedoms. This stems from the intrinsic nature of autocoups, which disrupt the
established process of political leadership transition, particularly term limits.

Term limits are constitutional provisions that restrict the maximum duration a
leader can remain in office. They play a crucial role in both democracies and
autocracies by preventing the excessive concentration of power and ensuring
political stability. In democracies, term limits promote accountability,
leadership renewal, and reduce the risks of corruption and authoritarian
entrenchment. In autocracies, when enforced, they can curb indefinite rule,
mitigate succession crises, and provide rare opportunities for political
transitions. However, without term limits, leaders can entrench themselves in
power, undermining institutions and hindering political progress.

As shown in @tbl-autocoup_method in Chapter 3, autocoups are executed through
either façade legal mechanisms or blatantly illegal methods. This includes
amending or disregarding term limits, delaying or cancelling elections, rigging
electoral outcomes, or outright refusing to accept election results. While many
autocoups maintain a veneer of legality, their defining characteristic is the
violation of term limits, which are intended as safeguards against prolonged and
unchecked rule.

As previously discussed, before an incumbent leader formally overstays their
term, they often inflict significant damage on political institutions.
Furthermore, to secure their prolonged rule, they are unlikely to fully restore
political freedoms even if they temporarily ease political repression once they
have consolidated power.

Case studies from Peru and Belarus illustrate how autocoups lead to a decline in
Polity scores, reflecting democratic backsliding. However, most autocoups occur
in already autocratic regimes where Polity scores are low. This aligns with
trends observed in coups, which also primarily occur in autocracies.

For instance, in China’s 2018 constitutional amendment, Xi Jinping abolished
presidential term limits, effectively allowing himself to remain in power
indefinitely[^2]. However, China’s Polity score remained unchanged at -7 before
and after the amendment. This pattern is common in autocratic regimes with Polity
scores below -6, as they already lack significant democratic features, leaving
little room for further decline.

While most autocoups occur in low-Polity-score countries, some have taken place
in relatively democratic settings, where the Polity score remains stable despite
term limit extensions. This is particularly evident in Latin America, where
presidents have amended "no immediate re-election" rules to allow for a second
consecutive term, but voluntarily stepped down afterwards. Examples include:
Argentina (1993), Polity score remained at 7; Brazil (1997), Polity score
remained at 8, Colombia (2004), Polity score remained at 7. In these cases,
leaders extended their tenure within a structured political framework without
further dismantling democratic institutions [@baturo2019].

Across all cases—whether in Peru, Belarus, China, Argentina, Brazil, or
Colombia—there is no instance where a Polity score increased following an
autocoup. In the autocoup dataset which I introduced in Chapter 3, only four
cases—Guinea-Bissau (1988), Burkina Faso (1997), Congo-Brazzaville (2001), and
Lebanon (2004)—saw minor increases in Polity scores, but the changes were
insignificant.

Thus, unlike some coup leaders who justify their actions by claiming to restore
democracy (as seen in Niger’s 2010 case), leaders who execute autocoups lack any
democratic justification. If their true intention were to advance democracy, they
would transfer power peacefully rather than violate term limits.

Based on this analysis, I propose the second hypothesis:

> *H2*: Autocoups are more likely to entrench autocracy than coups.

### Methodology and variables

#### Methodology

As discussed earlier, autocoups are less likely to result in full regime
transitions—either from democracy to autocracy or vice versa. Therefore, it is
inappropriate to assess their effects solely based on regime transitions or
changes that cross a critical threshold. Instead, this study examines political
changes through fluctuations in Polity5 scores.

Unlike coup analysis, which primarily focuses on post-event effects, this study
examines both pre-event and post-event impacts of autocoups. Specifically,
pre-event effects are measured by the change in Polity5 scores three years before
the autocoup compared to the year of the autocoup, expressed as:

$Polity_t - Polity_{t-3}$

Post-event effects are measured by the change in Polity5 scores three years after
the autocoup compared to the year of the autocoup, expressed as:

$Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t$

The three-year window is chosen for two key reasons. Pre-event political changes
typically occur incrementally, as incumbents consolidate power gradually over
several years rather than through a single, abrupt action. Post-event analysis
focuses on medium-term effects rather than short-term shocks, as autocoups rarely
trigger immediate regime transitions and instead reinforce existing political
structures. Short-term fluctuations may be too minor to capture meaningful
institutional change empirically.

To estimate how political institutions change before and after autocoups, I
employ a linear model with country-case fixed effects. For pre-event effects, I
analyze attempted autocoups, since before the event, no one knows whether the
autocoup will succeed or fail.

For post-event effects, I analyze only successful autocoups for three reasons:
The majority of autocoups succeed (87 out of 110 cases); failed autocoups tend to
produce immediate political shocks, rather than medium- or long-term effects;
failed autocoups are often followed by major disruptive events, such as coups,
insurrections, or mass protests, making it difficult to isolate their impact. For
example, in Niger's case, a failed autocoup in 2009 was followed by a coup in
2010, creating overlapping political effects. In contrast, successful autocoups
provide a clearer analytical framework, as their effects are less entangled with
other disruptions, allowing for a more systematic assessment of institutional
change.

#### Variables

This study uses a global sample of all country-year data from 1950 to 2020,
applying a linear model to examine the effects of autocoups on political change.
The dependent variable is the change in Polity scores, while the main independent
variable is autocoups. The dataset includes approximately 7,500 observations.

The dependent variable measures political change using three-year differences in
Polity scores. Model 1 (Pre-event effects): $Polity_t − Polity_{t − 3}$. Model 2
(Post-event effects): $Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t$.

The Polity score ranges from -10 (full autocracy) to 10 (full democracy). Some
values in the dataset, such as -66, -77, and -88, represent transitional regimes
or special periods. To prevent excessive data loss, I replace these values with
the closest valid Polity scores. This approach ensures that the model captures
all changes in Polity scores, rather than focusing solely on transitions that
cross a democratic threshold.

The main independent variable is autocoups, as introduced in Chapter 3. The
dataset includes110 attempted autocoups (used for pre-event analysis) and 87
successful autocoups (used for post-event analysis). For pre-event analysis, the
autocoup variable is binary, where: 1 indicates the presence of an attempted
autocoup and 0 indicates no autocoup event.

For post-event analysis, I apply decay functions to account for both immediate
and delayed effects, following the methodology of @dahl2023. To assess the
persistence of autocoup effects, I consider a half-life specification of five
years, analysing the impact from the autocoup year ($y_t$) to four years after
($y_{t+4}$).

I also include traditional coups as a secondary independent variable for two
reasons. Comparative significance: It is essential to compare the effects of
autocoups and coups. Overlapping events: In many cases, coups and autocoups are
interconnected, as autocoups can trigger coups. Distinguishing their effects is
necessary for a clear empirical analysis.

As in previous chapters, I use the coup dataset from @powell2011. To maintain
consistency, I apply the same methodological approach to coups as to autocoups:
Binary coding for pre-event effects and decay function coding for post-event
effects.

Control variables include economic performance, political violence, and
population size, all of which have been analysed in previous chapters.
Additionally, I incorporate two dummy variables. The first,
**"**non_democracy**,"** accounts for regime type, recognizing that
non-democratic regimes with Polity scores below -6 have limited room for further
decline, while democracies with scores above 6 are less likely to experience
significant increases. The second, **"**cold_war**,"** follows the approach used
in prior studies on the impact of coups on democratization [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023] and accounts for the Cold War period. This
variable captures the observable trend of declining Polity scores from the 1960s
to 1990, followed by an upward shift after 1990.

### Results and discussion

#### Pre-event effects

Initially, I analyse the trajectory of Polity scores leading up to these events.
As presented in @tbl-demomodel, columns 1 and 2 display the empirical results for
pre-event effects, examining changes over two years (model 1) and three years
(model 2) prior to the event. Consistent with the first hypothesis, Polity scores
exhibit a significant decline in the 2–3 years preceding an autocoup. Notably,
this downward trend is both more pronounced and statistically significant for
autocoups compared to traditional coups.

Column 1 examines the pre-event changes, specifically the difference between
Polity scores at time $t-1$ and $t-3$ ($Polity_{t-1} - Polity_{t-3}$). The
results reveal a statistically significant decrease in Polity scores prior to
autocoups. On average, Polity scores decline by 0.45 in the two years before an
autocoup, holding other factors constant. In contrast, no significant changes are
observed before traditional coups, indicating that pre-coup periods do not
measurably affect democratization levels.

Column 2 assesses the cumulative impact from three years prior to the event year,
calculated as $Polity_{t} - Polity_{t-3}$. As previously discussed, the year of
an autocoup or coup witnesses a substantial shock to political institutions.
Consequently, both types of events result in a decline in Polity scores relative
to three years earlier. However, the negative effect of autocoups is more severe.
Polity scores decline by an average of 1.53 in the three years leading up to an
autocoup, compared to 1.27 for coups, all else being equal. This disparity
reinforces our hypothesis that autocoups have a more detrimental pre-event effect
on democratic institutions as incumbents overextend their legitimate tenure.

#### Post-event effects

Columns 3 and 4 present the empirical results for post-event effects, analysing
changes in Polity scores following attempted (column 3) and successful (column 4)
autocoups.

Column 3 examines the impact of attempted autocoups. The results indicate that
attempted autocoups do not have a statistically significant effect on Polity
scores. This contrasts with coup attempts, which lead to an average increase of
0.48 in Polity scores over three years, all else being equal.

Column 4 evaluates the impact of successful autocoups. In contrast to attempted
autocoups, successful autocoups demonstrate a significant negative effect on
Polity scores, with an average decline of 0.33 over three years, holding other
factors constant. Conversely, successful coups continue to exhibit positive
effects on democratization, resulting in an average increase of 0.72.

These findings yield several key insights. First, while both successful and
attempted coups influence Polity scores, only successful autocoups produce
statistically significant effects—and exclusively in a negative direction.
Second, the impact of coups on democratization is more nuanced. Although
post-coup Polity scores may improve, the pre-coup period often involves
significant democratic backsliding. My models indicate that, on average, the
democratic gains following a coup fail to offset the losses incurred before it.

#### Effects of control variables

To ensure robust results, I incorporated several control variables into the
models. While economic trends and political violence do not exhibit statistically
significant effects on Polity scores, other factors warrant further discussion.

The impact of the Cold War is relatively straightforward. As outlined in the
research design section, global democracy experienced a general decline during
the Cold War period. Consistent with this trend, all four models indicate that
the Cold War era is associated with an average decrease of 0.23 in Polity scores.

The effects of GDP per capita, population size, and regime type, however, present
a more complex pattern. Counter-intuitively, higher GDP per capita correlates
with lower Polity scores, whereas non-democratic regimes and larger populations
correspond with positive changes in Polity scores. This pattern may be explained
by considering baseline differences between democracies and non-democracies. In
established democracies, Polity scores are already high, leaving limited room for
further increases. These countries also tend to have higher GDP per capita and
lower birth rates, further reinforcing stability in their democratic scores. In
contrast, non-democracies start from lower Polity scores, providing greater
potential for upward movement. Given that authoritarian regimes often exhibit
weaker economic performance and higher population growth rates, their Polity
scores may increase as they undergo political transitions or reforms.

Taken together, these results support both hypotheses. First, the primary effects
of autocoups on Polity scores manifest before the events occur. Second, whereas
coups have ambiguous consequences for democratization, the effects of autocoups
are unidirectional—consistently negative.

#### Robustness tests

To assess the sensitivity of my key findings to model specifications, I conduct a
series of robustness tests. The results indicate that the findings remain
consistent across these variations.

First, I compare the effects of autocoups over a period ranging from one to five
years after the event. The results show that the effects of coups are positive
and statistically significant throughout all five years, with a general trend of
increasing magnitude as time progresses. In contrast, the effects of autocoups
are negative across all five years but reach statistical significance only three
years after the event. This finding aligns with the earlier hypothesis: autocoups
never contribute to an increase in Polity scores.

Second, I refine the treatment of autocoups by replacing the decay effects of
autocoups with a dummy variable that distinguishes between attempted and
successful autocoups. Additionally, I disaggregate the ‘Non-democracy’ category
into specific regime types—democracy, dominant-party, military, monarchy, and
personal—consistent with the analysis of coup determinants, setting democracy as
the reference category.

Columns 1 and 2 in @tbl-demomodel2 examine the effects of attempted autocoups,
measured two and three years after the event, respectively, while Columns 3 and 4
focus on successful autocoups. As in previous models, these adjustments do not
alter the core findings across all four models. However, while they lead to
differences in regression coefficients, the results consistently show that Polity
scores decline following autocoups in all models, in contrast to the increase
observed after coups.

Comparing Columns 3 and 4 in @tbl-demomodel2 and @tbl-demomodel, it becomes
evident that replacing the decay factor for autocoups and coups with a dummy
variable significantly amplifies the estimated effects—nearly doubling them. This
result aligns with expectations, as the decay factor distributes the influence of
events over subsequent years, whereas the event dummy captures their impact
exclusively in the year of occurrence.

Furthermore, @tbl-demomodel2 reveals distinct regime-specific variations.
Military regimes exhibit the largest increase in Polity scores, followed by
monarchies and personalist regimes, with dominant-party regimes showing the
smallest but still statistically significant positive effect compared to
democracies. This finding corroborates the results in Chapter 2, which indicate
that military and personalist regimes are more prone to coups. The analysis in
this chapter proves that Polity scores increase significantly following coups.

### Summary

This chapter examines the impact of autocoups on political institutions,
particularly in contrast to coups, by analysing their effects on changes in
Polity scores. It tests two central hypotheses: first, that unlike coups, the
effects of autocoups on Polity scores manifest primarily before the event,
indicating that leaders consolidate power in anticipation of their autocoups; and
second, that while coups produce ambiguous effects—sometimes leading to
democratization and other times reinforcing authoritarianism, as suggested by
previous literature—autocoups consistently result in democratic backsliding or
authoritarian entrenchment.

To evaluate these hypotheses, the chapter employs multiple robustness checks,
including varying time horizons, alternative model specifications, and different
variable treatments. A key finding is that Polity scores begin to decline in the
years leading up to an autocoup, underscoring a pre-emptive process of
authorization. In contrast, coups initially cause a sharp drop in Polity scores
due to the shock of leadership change, but over time, scores often rise,
suggesting that in some cases, coups can contribute to an improvement in the
level of democracy. These findings highlight the fundamentally different
political trajectories triggered by coups and autocoups.

The implications of these results are significant for both academic research and
political practice. While coups have long been a focal point of democratization
studies, this chapter argues that autocoups demand equal, if not greater,
attention due to their systematic role in reversing democratic progress. Unlike
coups, which can sometimes serve as catalysts for political reform, autocoups
almost always reinforce authoritarianism, weakening institutions and eroding
democratic governance. This underscores the urgent need for scholars and
policy-makers to closely monitor the conditions that enable autocoups and their
broader consequences for democratic stability.

Methodologically, this chapter contributes to the study of political transitions
by demonstrating the importance of pre-event trends in analysing regime change.
It also highlights the necessity of distinguishing between different types of
irregular power transitions when assessing their long-term effects. While the
findings reinforce the study’s core arguments, they also raise questions for
future research—particularly regarding leader survival. As shown in Chapter 4,
autocoup leaders tend to survive in power for nearly 11 years on average, while
coup-installed leaders last only about 5 years. This suggests that coups and
autocoups not only differ in their immediate effects but also have distinct
long-term political consequences.

In conclusion, this chapter strengthens the argument that autocoups are a
critical yet under-explored mechanism of authoritarian survival, one that
warrants further investigation to fully understand its implications for global
democratization and authoritarian resilience.

## Conclusion

### Main findings

This study provides critical insights into the dynamics and implications of
irregular power transitions, with a specific focus on coups and autocoups. The
research illuminates the complex interplay between incumbents and challengers
vying for power, yielding three key findings.

-   **Coup attempt determinant**: The expected success rate significantly
    influences the likelihood of a coup attempt. This success rate is largely
    determined by the balance of power between incumbent leaders and challengers,
    which varies by regime type. Notably, the findings show that military regimes
    are approximately 277.7% more likely, and personalist regimes 94% more
    likely, to experience coups compared to dominant-party regimes, all else
    being equal.

-   **Autocoup concept and dataset**: I introduce a refined concept of
    "autocoup", defined as an incumbent leader's refusal to relinquish power as
    mandated. We present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events
    from 1945 to 2023, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups.
    Case studies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset's utility for
    quantitative research.

-   **Leader longevity**: Survival analysis techniques reveal clear differences
    in leader longevity between coup-installed leaders and autocoup leaders. The
    findings reveal that, on average, coup-installed leaders are 2.23 times more
    likely to be ousted from power than autocoup leaders, all else being equal.

### Policy implications

The examination of irregular power transitions and leadership survival offers a
crucial perspective on the interrelated phenomena of democratic backsliding,
breakdown, and autocratic intensification. The findings of this study provide
logical explanations for several political trends:

-   **Global democracy regression:** This study elucidates why global freedom has
    declined for the 18th consecutive year. Irregular power transitions, whether
    through coups or autocoups, inherently violate democratic norms and disrupt
    the trajectory toward stable democracies.

-   **Within-regime democratic erosion:** The research explains why democratic
    backsliding often occurs within regimes [@mechkova2017], rather than through
    regime change. Democracies are becoming less liberal and autocracies less
    competitive, particularly due to the prevalence of autocoups since 2000
    [@bermeo2016]. As discussed in Chapter 3, autocoups extend the tenure of
    incumbent leaders without overturning the regime itself.

-   **Rise of autocoups since 2000:** The analysis also clarifies why autocoups
    have been on the rise since 2000. Incumbent leaders possess several strategic
    advantages: firstly, they have a significantly higher probability of success
    due to their incumbent vantages compared to coup plotters. Secondly, the
    consequences of failed autocoups are relatively milder than those for failed
    coup plotters, resulting in lower costs even if they fail. Lastly, leaders
    who manage to extend their rule through an autocoup often enjoy considerably
    longer tenures compared to coup-installed leaders, thus benefiting more
    substantially.

-   **Role of external pressure:** Due to the challenges of internal opposition
    to autocoups, where power is concentrated in the hands of incumbent leaders,
    external pressure from regional or international communities may play a vital
    role in encouraging adherence to constitutional processes of power
    transition. For instance, after the general election in Venezuela on July 29,
    2024, at least nine Latin American countries rejected the election results
    and called for dialogue[^3]. Although this pressure might not be effective in
    every case, it showcases the potential influence of the international
    community in discouraging future autocoup attempts.

### Limitations and directions for future research

While the study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular leadership
transitions, several limitations require further exploration:

-   **Data refinement:** Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach.
    Future research should validate this classification system through additional
    studies and expert evaluations.

-   **Data harmonization:** The current analysis faces challenges due to
    mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup
    datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for
    more robust comparisons.

-   **Democratic backsliding:** While this study establishes a connection between
    irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical
    evidence is needed to solidify this link.

Future research avenues include:

-   **Terminology and data collection:** Refining the "autocoup" concept and
    achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive
    data collection.

-   **Dataset expansion:** Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and
    integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can
    provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.

-   **Power dynamics and long-term impacts:** Utilizing this dataset, future
    studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the
    long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems,
    particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization
    of power.

In conclusion, this study significantly contributes to our understanding of
irregular leadership transitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining
autocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader
longevity, I establish a robust framework for understanding irregular power
transitions and leadership survival. This work deepens our comprehension of
democratic resilience and political stability, providing a foundation for future
research to conduct further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup
dataset and continue refining the framework.
