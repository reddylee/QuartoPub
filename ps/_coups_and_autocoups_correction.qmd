## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This thesis addresses a notable lacuna in the study of irregular leadership
transitions by systematically incorporating autocoups—instances wherein incumbent
leaders extend their constitutionally mandated terms through extra-constitutional
means. It refines the conceptual definition of autocoups by resolving prevailing
ambiguities, thereby aligning them more closely with conventional coup
frameworks. On the basis of this refined definition, the thesis introduces a
novel global dataset of autocoup events spanning the period from 1945 to 2023,
comprising 83 documented cases, 64 of which were successful.

Utilising this dataset, the study conducts a large-N empirical analysis to
examine the structural determinants of autocoups. The findings indicate that most
power-centred regimes–presidential democracies and personalist regimes–are
significantly more susceptible to employing autocoups as a strategy for power
retention, in contrast to other regime types. This pattern diverges from that of
traditional coups, which have historically been more prevalent in military
regimes.

The analysis then shifts to the question of leadership survival, employing
survival analysis techniques to compare the political longevity of leaders who
assumed office via traditional coups with those who retained power through
autocoups. Contrary to the hypothesis that autocoup leaders survive longer than
their coup-installed counterparts, the results reveal that—once very short-lived
leaderships (less than 180 days) are excluded—the method of power acquisition
does not exert a statistically significant effect on leadership duration.
Instead, regime type emerges once again as the critical determinant: military
regimes exhibit a significantly higher hazard ratio for leadership removal
compared to the reference category of dominant-party regimes, mirroring trends
observed in classic coups.

The thesis also assesses the broader institutional ramifications of such
irregular power transitions, particularly with respect to democratisation. Using
Polity scores as a proxy for democratic quality and applying a country-fixed
effects model, the analysis demonstrates that autocoups are associated with a
sustained erosion of democratic institutions both preceding and following their
occurrence. In contrast, while traditional coups often precipitate an immediate
and sharp decline in democratic quality, they are frequently followed by
democratic recovery or transitions over time. These findings highlight the
divergent political trajectories engendered by coups and autocoups and call for
greater scholarly and policy attention to the consistently negative consequences
of autocoups for democratic governance.

Taken together, the findings underscore the distinct nature, drivers, and
consequences of coups and autocoups. This research makes several substantive
contributions: it clarifies the conceptual boundaries of autocoups; provides a
new empirical basis for their systematic study; and offers robust comparative
insights into how different modes of irregular power transition influence both
leadership survival and institutional development. The implications are
substantial for academic scholarship and policy-making alike, particularly in the
context of global democratic backsliding and the resilience of political
institutions.

## Introduction

At the heart of contemporary political dynamics lies a fundamental question: why
are some political leaders prematurely removed from office, while others succeed
in extending their tenure beyond constitutionally mandated limits? Furthermore,
how does the mode of their survival or removal shape political stability and
democratic institutions? This thesis seeks to address these critical questions by
analysing the structural and strategic foundations of irregular leadership
transitions.

### Motivations

The stability and resilience of political systems depend crucially on the orderly
transfer of power. When leadership transitions occur within established
institutional frameworks, they reinforce political legitimacy and contribute to
regime durability. In contrast, the breakdown of conventional mechanisms for
political succession often precipitates instability, violence, and democratic
backsliding. Among the most disruptive of such breakdowns are irregular
leadership transitions, which leave lasting institutional legacies and
fundamentally alter the political trajectory of regimes. Understanding the causes
and consequences of these events remains central to the study of political order
and regime change.

The extant literature identifies a broad array of catalysts for irregular
leadership exits, including civil wars [@kokkonen2019], international conflict
[@demesquita1995], ethnic divisions [@londregan1995], economic crises
[@miller2012; @krishnarajan2019], and natural disasters [@quirozflores2012].
Among these, coups d’état are particularly consequential due to both their
frequency and their direct displacement of incumbent leaders. In autocratic
regimes, coups account for nearly one-third of all leadership exits—exceeding
regular transitions, which constitute just over one-fifth [@frantz2016].
Furthermore, over 63% of non-constitutional removals in dictatorships are
attributable to coups [@svolik2009].

Consequently, coups have received extensive scholarly attention. A substantial
body of research explores their causes, outcomes, and long-term implications for
democracy and development [@thyne2019]. In particular, the study of coup
determinants has flourished, with scholars proposing nearly one hundred
explanatory variables. Yet, a widely accepted baseline model remains elusive
[@gassebner2016].

By contrast, another form of irregular power transition—the autocoup—has received
comparatively limited academic scrutiny. In an autocoup, an incumbent extends
their tenure by circumventing or overriding constitutional term limits through
extra-constitutional means. While autocoups do not immediately result in
leadership change, they constitute a fundamental breach of institutional
succession norms and obstruct the expected regular transfer of power. As such,
they warrant classification as a critical, albeit understudied, variant of
irregular leadership transition.

This thesis argues that autocoups deserve systematic analysis alongside
traditional coups within a unified analytical framework. Despite differences in
execution, both coups and autocoups involve extra-constitutional efforts to
acquire or retain power, and both have significant implications for leadership
survival, regime stability, and democratic integrity. Comparative analysis of
these two forms of irregular transition can reveal shared drivers, divergent
outcomes, and broader lessons for democratic resilience.

The urgency of this inquiry is underscored by the serious risks associated with
irregular transitions. Both coups and autocoups may trigger immediate
crises—ranging from institutional paralysis to civil unrest—and leave deep
institutional scars. More fundamentally, they tend to dismantle constitutional
checks and balances, undermine electoral processes, and accelerate democratic
decline or authoritarian consolidation.

Historical cases illustrate these dangers vividly. Ghana’s turbulent era from
1979 to 1984 reflects the destabilising effects of classic coups. Following Jerry
Rawlings’s 1979 coup, eight individuals, including three former heads of state,
were executed [@pieterse1982]. Rawlings launched another coup in 1981 and
subsequently quashed three further coup attempts [@haynes2022d]. In contrast, the
1992 autocoup in Peru, orchestrated by President Alberto Fujimori, exemplifies
how an incumbent can dismantle democratic institutions without a change in
leadership. Fujimori dissolved Congress, suspended the constitution, and ruled by
decree [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998].

These patterns are increasingly salient in today’s global political landscape.
According to Freedom House’s Freedom in the World 2024 report, global political
rights and civil liberties declined for the eighteenth consecutive year in 2023,
with setbacks recorded in 52 countries and improvements in only 21
[@freedomhouse2024freedom]. The persistence of democratic erosion highlights the
pressing need to understand the mechanisms that facilitate it—including both
coups and autocoups.

This thesis seeks to advance both theoretical and empirical understanding of
irregular leadership transitions. It offers insights with substantial
implications for scholarly research and policy formulation in fragile or
democratising regimes.

### Research objectives and contributions

In response to the pressing challenges posed by irregular leadership transitions,
this study undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis structured around four
core research objectives. First, it seeks to refine the conceptual definition of
autocoups and introduce a novel dataset amenable to large-N empirical analysis.
Second, it aims to identify the structural and institutional determinants of
autocoups through a systematic quantitative investigation. Third, it compares the
survival prospects of leaders who ascend to power via traditional coups with
those who extend their tenure through autocoups. Finally, it assesses the
divergent impacts of coups and autocoups on democratisation trajectories and the
resilience of political institutions.

By examining both coups and autocoups from 1950 to 2023, this thesis addresses a
significant gap in political science by developing and applying a unified
analytical framework that treats these events as distinct yet interrelated forms
of extra-constitutional power transition. Through this lens, the study makes four
principal contributions to the literature on leadership dynamics, regime
stability, and institutional development.

#### Conceptual clarification and empirical foundation for autocoups {.unnumbered}

This thesis advances conceptual clarity by situating autocoups within the broader
typology of irregular power transitions. It offers a refined definition of
autocoups—centred on the executive's unilateral extension of tenure—and clearly
differentiates them from both executive aggrandisement and traditional military
coups. Building upon this conceptual framework, the study introduces an original
dataset of autocoups spanning the period from 1945 to 2023, documenting 83
incidents, of which 64 were successful. This dataset addresses a long-standing
empirical lacuna and provides a foundational basis for systematic comparative
analysis, thereby enabling future research into a previously under-examined form
of institutional disruption.

#### First emipirical analysis of determinants of autocoups {.unnumbered}

Utilising this newly compiled dataset, the thesis undertakes the first empirical
examination of the structural and institutional conditions under which autocoups
are likely to occur. The analysis finds that leaders operating within
power-concentrated systems—particularly presidential democracies and personalist
regimes—are significantly more prone to extending their tenure through autocoups
than those operating in other regime types. These findings contribute to the
literature on the relationship between regime characteristics and irregular power
retention, highlighting the critical role of institutional structures in shaping
leaders' strategic decisions to override term limits.

#### Comparative analysis of leadership longevity: Coup vs autocoup leaders {.unnumbered}

The research further contributes to the study of leadership survival by comparing
the tenure durations of leaders who attain power through coups with those who
retain it via autocoups. Employing survival analysis on both the coup and
autocoup datasets, the study finds that, contrary to the assumption, the method
of power acquisition is not a significant predictor of leadership longevity.
However, it reaffirms that regime type plays a decisive role in leader survival,
irrespective of the mode of accession or retention. The survival models indicate
that leaders within military regimes exhibit a higher hazard ratio of removal
compared to those in dominant-party regimes. These results underscore the
influence of regime structure on leadership durability and elite turnover.

#### Comparative democratic implications of coups and autocoups {.unnumbered}

The thesis also investigates the differential impacts of coups and autocoups on
democratic development. Employing country-fixed effects regression models and
utilising Polity V scores as an indicator of democratic quality, the analysis
finds that autocoups are consistently associated with gradual and sustained
democratic erosion—both preceding and following the event. In contrast, coups
yield more heterogeneous institutional outcomes. While they often result in
immediate setbacks to democratic norms, in certain instances they facilitate
democratic transitions, including shifts from autocracy to democracy. This
disaggregated analysis reveals the distinct trajectories and institutional
consequences engendered by different forms of irregular power transitions.

### Policy implications

Although scholarly debate persists regarding the potential for coups to
inadvertently foster democratisation under certain conditions [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016], there exists a strong policy consensus that
coups constitute inherently illegitimate mechanisms of political change. As
violent disruptions of constitutional order, they tend to inflict immediate
institutional damage, precipitate instability, and lead to unpredictable
political trajectories. Accordingly, both international and domestic policy
responses have rightly prioritised prevention—most notably through
“coup-proofing” strategies designed to insulate regimes from military
intervention or elite defection [@quinlivan1999; @pilster2012; @powell;
@albrecht2014; @carey2015; @brown2015; @sudduth2017]. However, as this thesis
demonstrates, such approaches have well-documented limitations [@albrecht2014a;
@reiter2020], and deeper structural power dynamics within regimes are frequently
more decisive in determining vulnerability to both coups and autocoups.

From this vantage point, the findings of the study generate several important
policy implications.

The first, and most immediate, implication concerns the design and architecture
of political institutions. Regimes characterised by robust horizontal
accountability mechanisms—such as independent legislatures, judiciaries, and
oversight bodies—demonstrate greater resilience to irregular power seizures. A
carefully calibrated balance of power reduces both the opportunity and the
incentive for executive actors to override constitutional constraints.
Institutional designs that disperse authority, limit executive aggrandisement,
and embed strong checks and balances may therefore serve as the primary bulwark
against both coups and autocoups. Promoting sound governance practices—through
the enforcement of constitutional term limits, the strengthening of civil
society, and the institutionalisation of transparent succession procedures—is
essential to mitigating the risk of authoritarian entrenchment.

A second major policy implication concerns the role of external actors and
international institutions. Regional and global organisations—including MERCOSUR,
the Organization of American States (OAS), the African Union (AU), ECOWAS, the
European Union, and the Council of Europe—have played a significant role in
deterring unconstitutional leadership changes. By establishing legal frameworks
that uphold democratic governance and deploying instruments such as sanctions,
diplomatic isolation, and suspension of membership, these bodies can exert
meaningful pressure on regimes that come to power via military coups or other
overt breaches of constitutional norms [@wobig2014; @shannon2014; @thyne2017].

Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these mechanisms is often more limited in the
context of autocoups. Unlike traditional coups, autocoups are typically executed
through procedural manipulation—such as emergency decrees, rigged referenda, or
constitutional amendments—rather than overt displays of force. This legalistic
façade complicates international responses: the absence of visible violence or
abrupt leadership change often leads to delayed or inadequate intervention,
hampered by political ambiguity and the absence of consensus.

Given the rising incidence of autocoups since the early 2000s and their central
role in contemporary democratic backsliding [@bermeo2016; @mechkova2017],
international actors must adapt their monitoring and response frameworks
accordingly. A third and urgent policy recommendation thus emerges: regional and
international organisations must shift from reactive to proactive modes of
engagement, developing criteria that capture gradual institutional erosion—a
defining feature of modern authoritarian consolidation. Rather than awaiting
clear-cut disruptions, policymakers should utilise existing democratic monitoring
instruments—such as Polity scores, Freedom House ratings, and V-Dem indices—to
track sustained declines in institutional quality, media freedom, judicial
independence, and electoral competitiveness. Observable patterns of democratic
regression should be treated as early warning indicators, prompting calibrated
responses such as diplomatic engagement, conditional aid adjustments, public
condemnation, or targeted sanctions. Such measures would enable the international
community to act before constitutional frameworks are irreparably degraded.

In sum, this thesis underscores the evolving nature of threats to democratic
governance. While coups remain a visible and disruptive threat to political
order, autocoups represent a more insidious form of democratic erosion—one that
proceeds incrementally and often under the guise of legality. To safeguard
constitutional rule in an era marked by creeping authoritarianism, both domestic
institutions and international mechanisms must be reconfigured to detect and
counteract the gradual unraveling of democratic norms, not merely their sudden
collapse.

### Limitations and future research

Whilst this study proposes a novel analytical framework for understanding coups
and autocoups, their effects on leadership survival, and their broader
institutional implications, several limitations remain, indicating important
directions for future research and refinement.

First, although the definition and classification of autocoups advanced herein
represent a meaningful conceptual contribution, broader scholarly consensus on
these parameters remains underdeveloped. The definitional boundaries and the
empirical dataset introduced in this study serve as foundational contributions;
nonetheless, they are necessarily preliminary. Future research should seek to
further elaborate and refine these components to enhance the reliability,
validity, and comparability of findings across different analytical contexts.

A core challenge concerns the conceptual ambiguity that surrounds the very
definition of autocoups—particularly in borderline cases where incumbents extend
their authority through legal or quasi-legal mechanisms. Future work might
explore the normative and analytical trade-offs involved in including such cases
within the autocoup category. Comparative analyses of ‘unconstitutional’ versus
‘extra-constitutional’ extensions of executive tenure may assist in clarifying
whether these actions constitute variants of the same phenomenon or represent
analytically distinct processes.

This ambiguity in conceptual boundaries directly affects the construction of
empirical datasets. Minor alterations in inclusion criteria may lead to
substantial variation in the number and classification of identified cases,
particularly where intentions, timing, and legal interpretations are contested. A
case in point is that of President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras in 2009. Zelaya
proposed a referendum to amend the 1965 Constitution, which prohibited
presidential re-election, ostensibly to allow future leaders to seek an
additional term. As the referendum was scheduled for the same day as the national
election, its immediate passage would not have benefited Zelaya directly.
Nevertheless, questions persist regarding his underlying intent: by promoting a
reform that appeared not to advantage him personally, Zelaya may have sought to
cultivate public support for a subsequent reinterpretation or further amendment
aimed at extending his own rule. Ultimately, he was removed by a military coup,
precipitating a severe constitutional crisis [@muñoz-portillo2019]. This case
illustrates the analytical complexity of identifying autocoups and underscores
the necessity of refining coding criteria and interpretive clarity in future data
collection efforts.

Accordingly, both the conceptual framework and empirical foundation developed in
this study would benefit from sustained theoretical debate and methodological
refinement. Several promising avenues for future inquiry emerge.

Given the long-term decline in traditional coups and the parallel rise of
autocoups, increased scholarly attention to the latter is imperative. While this
study focuses on tenure extension as the defining feature of autocoups, broader
forms of executive power expansion—whether within or beyond the formal
constitutional framework—merit systematic investigation. These dynamics are both
frequent and damaging to institutional resilience, yet remain comparatively
under-explored in the literature on regime change and executive aggrandisement.
To capture the full range of such practices, the development of a dedicated
dataset on executive power expansion represents a crucial next step.

Moreover, the decreasing frequency of overt and dramatic regime transitions since
the early 2000s has coincided with a decline in unambiguous shifts between
democracy and autocracy. This trend highlights the necessity of more sensitive
instruments capable of detecting incremental changes within regimes. Future
empirical research should focus on identifying and measuring such subtler
transformations, including minor but sustained variations in Polity scores or
other disaggregated institutional indicators. By doing so, scholars will be
better equipped to monitor the gradual erosion—or potential recovery—of
democratic governance in contexts where abrupt regime change is no longer the
dominant mode of political transformation.

### Overview of the thesis

This thesis examines the complex power dynamics underlying coups and autocoups,
with a particular focus on their consequences for leadership survival and the
democratisation or authoritarian transformation of political regimes. It develops
a unified analytical framework to study these phenomena as distinct yet
interconnected forms of irregular power transition. Each chapter contributes to
this overarching inquiry by offering conceptual clarifications, empirical
innovations, and comparative insights.

#### Chapter 2: Conceptualising autocoups and data introduction {.unnumbered}

Despite the increasing incidence of autocoups—particularly in the post-Cold War
era—their systematic study remains underdeveloped. Existing scholarship suffers
from conceptual fragmentation, characterised by a proliferation of overlapping
and inconsistently defined terms (‘self-coup’, autogolpe, ‘executive
aggrandisement’, etc.) [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This conceptual
ambiguity complicates empirical analysis, as many datasets fail to distinguish
between tenure extension and other forms of executive power consolidation—an
essential distinction for this study. As a result, methodological progress has
been hindered, with most existing research relying on qualitative case studies
[@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], rather than large-N analyses.

This chapter addresses these limitations by proposing a more precise and
theoretically grounded definition of the autocoup. It contends that autocoups
should be defined as attempts by incumbents to extend their constitutionally
mandated terms of office. By centring the definition on tenure extension, the
concept excludes broader forms of executive aggrandisement that occur within
existing constitutional time-frames, and aligns autocoups conceptually with
classic coups, both of which involve disruptions to constitutionally prescribed
leadership succession. Accordingly, this study defines **an autocoup as the
extension of an incumbent leader’s tenure beyond its original constitutional
limit, achieved through extra-constitutional means**.

Based on this refined definition, the chapter presents a significant empirical
contribution: a newly compiled global dataset of autocoups spanning the period
1945 to 2023, identifying 83 distinct events, of which 64 were successful. This
dataset facilitates systematic quantitative analysis and opens new avenues for
comparative research on irregular retention of power.

#### Chapter 3: Determinants of autocoup attempts {.unnumbered}

Due to long-standing conceptual and empirical constraints, existing discussions
of autocoups have relied largely on case-based approaches [@baturo;
@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. The dataset introduced in Chapter 2 enables,
for the first time, a large-N analysis of the structural conditions underpinning
autocoup attempts.

Drawing upon insights from the coup literature, this chapter investigates a range
of potential predictors—including economic performance, succession rules,
military influence, protest activity, and media freedom. While these variables
have been analysed in the context of traditional coups, they often fail to
account for persistent cross-regime variation or the limited efficacy of
so-called ‘coup-proofing’ strategies [@albrecht2014a; @reiter2020]. Moreover,
many studies adopt overly simplistic regime typologies (e.g. democracy vs.
autocracy, or civilian vs. military), thereby obscuring important variation
within regime types [@hiroi2013; @schiel2019].

This chapter advances the argument that autocoup risk is shaped fundamentally by
the structural balance of power embedded in a regime’s founding configuration.
Specifically, the likelihood of an autocoup is determined by the equilibrium
between incumbents and potential institutional challengers—a balance largely set
at regime inception [@geddes2014]. To test this proposition, regime typologies
are employed as proxies for internal power structures.

Using both a standard logit model and a bias-reduced logit model (Firth’s
penalised maximum likelihood estimation), the analysis reveals that presidential
democracies and personalist regimes are significantly more prone to autocoup
attempts than dominant-party regimes, when other variables are held constant.
Leaders in dominant-party and military regimes, by contrast, do not significantly
differ in their likelihood of attempting an autocoup. These findings underscore
the centrality of regime type in shaping elite incentives for irregular tenure
extension.

#### Chapter 4: Power acquisition methods and leadership survival {.unnumbered}

Although a substantial body of literature has explored the tenure survival of
leaders who come to power through coups [@gandhi2007; @sudduth2017; @easton2018],
the absence of comparable data on autocoups has long precluded systematic
comparisons between coup-installed leaders and those who prolong their rule via
autocoups. This chapter addresses that gap by offering the first comparative
survival analysis of these two categories within a unified theoretical framework.

It argues that coup leaders typically face heightened legitimacy deficits,
political uncertainty, and institutional instability, whereas autocoup leaders
benefit from institutional continuity while simultaneously removing key
constraints. These distinct conditions shape divergent pathways to political
consolidation.

Surprisingly, the time-dependent Cox model shows no statistically significant
difference in survival risk between coup-installed and autocoup leaders once
relevant covariates—especially regime type—are taken into account. Rather, regime
characteristics exert a decisive influence on leadership tenure: leaders in
military and transitional regimes face significantly higher risks of removal than
those in dominant-party regimes.

#### Chapter 5: Coups, autocoups, and democracy {.unnumbered}

While the impact of coups on democratisation has received considerable scholarly
attention [@clayton2000; @powell2014a; @thyne2020], the consequences of autocoups
remain understudied due to the historical absence of relevant data. This chapter
addresses this lacuna through a quantitative analysis of how coups and autocoups
affect democratic institutions.

Whereas coups may produce leadership turnover or even regime change, autocoups
typically involve incumbents dismantling institutional constraints without
altering the core ruling coalition. Consequently, their effects are best assessed
not by regime-type transitions, but by shifts in continuous measures of
democratic quality, such as Polity V scores.

Two key claims are advanced. First, leaders often begin to erode institutional
checks in anticipation of an autocoup, resulting in declines in Polity scores
prior to the event itself. Second, while coups exhibit mixed outcomes—sometimes
enabling democratisation—autocoups almost invariably result in democratic erosion
or deeper authoritarian consolidation.

Empirical analysis using a country-fixed effects model confirms that autocoups
are associated with consistent declines in democratic quality both before and
after the event. By contrast, coups tend to cause an immediate drop in Polity
scores, although in some cases democratic recovery follows. These findings
highlight the uniquely insidious nature of autocoups, which often proceed
incrementally and under a legalistic façade.

#### Chapter 6: Conclusion and future research directions {.unnumbered}

The concluding chapter synthesises the findings of the preceding chapters,
drawing attention to the structural, strategic, and institutional dynamics that
underpin irregular leadership transitions. It contends that coups and autocoups
are not simply disruptive events, but strategic tools employed by elites to
recalibrate or entrench political authority. Their institutional legacies
diverge: while coups often destabilise regimes, autocoups typically consolidate
autocratic rule.

This chapter outlines the broader implications of these findings for
understanding the resilience of autocracy, the vulnerability of democratic
institutions, and the strategic calculus of political leaders. It also proposes
several directions for future research.

First, the broader phenomenon of executive power expansion—whether or not it
involves tenure extension—warrants systematic investigation. Given its increasing
frequency and corrosive institutional effects, the development of a dedicated
dataset on power expansions is strongly recommended.

Second, as full regime transitions become less common, future research should
focus on detecting subtle, incremental changes in political quality. Fine-grained
indicators—such as modest shifts in Polity scores—will be essential for
monitoring democratic backsliding and institutional recovery in hybrid or
semi-authoritarian regimes.

## Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Dataset Introduction {#sec-chapter3}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter presents a refined conceptualisation of autocoups, defined as
instances in which incumbent leaders extend their constitutionally mandated
tenure through extra-constitutional means, typically by circumventing or
violating term limits. By critically reviewing and synthesising overlapping
terms—such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive takeover—the chapter delineates
the conceptual boundaries of the phenomenon, identifying tenure extension as its
defining characteristic. In distinguishing autocoups from broader and more
ambiguous forms of executive aggrandisement, it advances a more analytically
precise framework for studying irregular power extensions. Building on this
conceptual foundation, the chapter introduces a novel global dataset of autocoup
events from 1945 to 2023, identifying 83 distinct cases, of which 64 were
successful. This empirical contribution enables systematic, large-N analysis of
an increasingly salient mode of authoritarian consolidation.

### Introduction

The stability and resilience of political systems rest fundamentally on the
orderly transfer of power. When leadership succession takes place within
established constitutional frameworks, it reinforces the legitimacy and
durability of governing institutions. Conversely, the breakdown of these norms
and mechanisms often precipitates political violence, institutional erosion, and
prolonged instability.

While many leadership transitions occur without disruption, a considerable
proportion do not. In particular, authoritarian regimes and fragile democracies
frequently experience two principal forms of irregular leadership outcomes: the
premature removal of incumbents and the extension of power beyond constitutional
limits.

The former—forced removals of leaders prior to the completion of their terms—has
been extensively examined under the broader category of irregular leadership
transitions. These events have profound consequences for regime stability,
democratic legitimacy, and institutional development. Accordingly, understanding
their causes and implications remains a core concern within political science.

The extant literature identifies a range of precipitating factors, including
civil war [@kokkonen2019], international conflict [@demesquita1995], ethnic
cleavages [@londregan1995], poor economic performance [@miller2012;
@krishnarajan2019], and natural disasters [@quirozflores2012]. Among these,
however, coups d’état—typically defined as illegal and overt attempts by the
military or state elites to depose a sitting executive [@powell2011]—stand out as
the most frequent and consequential source of leadership change. In autocratic
contexts, they account for approximately one-third of all leader exits,
surpassing even regular transitions [@frantz2016], while roughly two-thirds of
non-constitutional removals in dictatorships are attributable to coups
[@svolik2009]. Unsurprisingly, coups have attracted considerable scholarly
attention. Researchers have explored their structural determinants, proximate
triggers, aftermath, and effects on democratic consolidation and economic
development [@thyne2019].

Yet this focus on traditional coups risks overlooking a distinct and increasingly
salient form of irregular transition: the autocoup. In this chapter, an autocoup
is defined as an instance in which an incumbent leader extends their tenure by
subverting or bypassing constitutional term limits through extra-constitutional
means. Despite their rising incidence—particularly since the end of the Cold
War—autocoups remain under-theorised and under-examined. Conceptual fragmentation
has impeded progress, with a proliferation of overlapping and inconsistently
applied terms such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive aggrandisement
[@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This lack of definitional precision
complicates data collection and comparative analysis. Existing datasets often
conflate tenure extensions with broader forms of executive power consolidation,
thereby failing to isolate the specific mechanisms this study seeks to analyse
[@baturo2022]. Consequently, scholarship has tended to rely on qualitative case
studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], limiting the field’s
capacity for broader generalisation.

This chapter contends that these conceptual and empirical limitations obscure a
crucial dimension of contemporary politics. It thus proposes a unified analytical
framework for examining coups and autocoups as distinct yet comparable strategies
for undermining constitutional norms governing leadership succession. This
comparative approach is warranted on three grounds.

First, both coups and autocoups constitute fundamental breaches of constitutional
order, with significant implications for democratic resilience, political
legitimacy, and institutional integrity. Analysing them in tandem facilitates a
systematic examination of how different forms of irregular power transition shape
trajectories of political development and democratisation.

Second, while both disrupt established norms of succession, they operate in
opposite directions relative to the incumbent: coups terminate leadership
prematurely, whereas autocoups extend it beyond its constitutionally mandated
limit. This contrast offers a valuable lens through which to explore the
mechanisms of political survival and authoritarian consolidation.

Third, a comparative framework helps to illuminate pressing contemporary puzzles.
For instance, how can the marked decline in coup frequency since the 1990s
[@bermeo2016] be reconciled with the sustained erosion of democratic
governance—now in its eighteenth consecutive year [@freedomhouse2024freedom]? By
incorporating autocoups into the analytical schema, this study highlights the
growing significance of incremental, procedural subversions of democracy, often
orchestrated from within the existing legal and institutional architecture.

To address these gaps, the chapter makes two principal contributions. First, it
offers conceptual clarification by redefining autocoups as a subtype of irregular
leadership transition centred specifically on extra-constitutional tenure
extension. This refined definition distinguishes autocoups from broader, more
diffuse forms of executive aggrandisement. Second, it introduces a novel global
dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2023, compiled in accordance with this
reconceptualised framework, thereby enabling the first systematic large-N
analysis of the phenomenon.

The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews existing
definitions related to power extension and executive aggrandisement, culminating
in a revised conceptualisation of autocoups. Section 3 introduces the new
dataset, detailing its scope, coding criteria, and methodological foundations.
Section 4 presents an initial analysis through descriptive statistics and
illustrative case studies. The conclusion synthesises the chapter’s key
contributions and outlines directions for future research.

### literature review and clarification of definitions

A significant limitation in the study of irregular leadership transitions lies in
the insufficient integration of research on conventional coups and autocoups.
While both constitute critical mechanisms of extra-constitutional power transfer,
they have typically been examined in isolation, with limited attention paid to
their conceptual and empirical intersections.

This disjunction primarily arises from two factors: the historical
under-recognition of autocoups as a distinct subtype of irregular transition, and
the enduring conceptual ambiguity surrounding their definition. Whereas classic
coups are generally characterised by the abrupt removal of incumbents, autocoups
typically involve incumbent-led efforts to retain or expand power by
circumventing constitutional constraints. However, the inconsistent usage of
overlapping terms—such as ‘self-coup’, autogolpe, and ‘executive
aggrandisement’—has further muddied these distinctions.

Clarifying the definition of autocoups is thus a necessary step towards
constructing a comparative framework capable of capturing the full spectrum of
irregular power transitions. This section undertakes that task by distinguishing
autocoups from broader forms of executive power consolidation, and by
conceptually aligning them with traditional coups through their shared
transgression of constitutional norms.

#### Terminology {.unnumbered}

Studies of autocoups employ a wide range of terms to describe the extension of
power or tenure by incumbent leaders. The most commonly used is ‘self-coup’, or
autogolpe in Spanish [@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017;
@marsteintredet2019]. This term gained scholarly prominence following the actions
of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 1992, who dissolved Congress,
temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree [@mauceri1995;
@cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 rightly notes, ‘self-coup’ is a
potentially misleading label, as it implies that the leader acts against
themselves, whereas such moves are typically aimed at other state institutions or
constitutional constraints.

A second category of terminology includes expressions such as ‘presidential
coup’, ‘executive coup’, ‘constitutional coup’, ‘electoral coup’, ‘judicial
coup’, ‘slow-motion coup’, ‘soft coup’, and ‘parliamentary coup’
[@marsteintredet2019]. While these descriptors may offer insights into specific
mechanisms or contexts, their proliferation often leads to conceptual confusion.
Many centre on the method of power acquisition but fail to consistently identify
the perpetrator. Moreover, such mechanisms—judicial rulings, legislative
manoeuvres, or administrative decrees—may be employed either by or against
executive actors, further complicating classification.

A third group of terms includes phrases such as ‘incumbent takeover’, ‘executive
takeover’, and ‘overstay’. For instance, incumbent takeover refers to “an event
perpetuated by a ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or
informal constraints on his/her power” [@baturo2022, p. 374], drawing on earlier
work by @svolik2014. Similarly, overstay denotes “staying longer than the maximum
term as it stood when the candidate originally came into office”
[@ginsburg2011evasion, p. 1844]. These terms help to clarify the identity of the
actor (the incumbent) and the nature of the action (power consolidation or term
extension), yet they often fail to convey the illegality or unconstitutionality
of such actions. In contrast to ‘coup’, which inherently implies an unlawful
seizure of power, labels such as ‘takeover’ or ‘overstay’ may inadvertently
understate the normative gravity of the events they describe.

Given that many existing terms tend to prioritise procedural mechanisms over
normative considerations, or indeed conflate legal and extra-legal practices,
this study posits 'autocoup' as the most precise and analytically coherent term.
This term offers several key advantages.

**Definitional clarity and addressing the core essence:** 'Autocoup' precisely
denotes an incumbent leader's extension of their political tenure through
extra-constitutional means. This definition clearly distinguishes it from
conventional coups, typically initiated by external actors such as the military,
and from other, more diffuse or ill-defined instances of executive
aggrandisement.

**Emphasis on severity and normative implications:** The suffix '-coup'
powerfully signifies the grave breach of constitutional order inherent in such
actions. In both academic research and policy assessment contexts, the level of
disruption and impact is no less than, and may even exceed, that of conventional
coups, thereby imbuing the term with appropriate normative and critical weight.

**Accurate identification of the perpetrator:** The prefix 'auto-' directly
identifies the incumbent leader as the instigator of such events. This stands in
stark contrast to conventional coups, which are typically orchestrated by actors
external to the incumbent's immediate circle, such as the military or opposition
factions, thereby facilitating precise attribution.

**Promotion of conceptual coherence and comparative analysis:** 'Autocoup' shares
an etymological root with 'coup', ensuring an intrinsic conceptual link and
logical consistency. This enables systematic comparative analysis of different
yet related forms of irregular leadership transition within a unified analytical
framework, thereby deepening the understanding of these phenomena.

In summary, the term 'autocoup' not only pinpoints with precision both the actor
and the act itself but also clearly reveals the illegitimacy and gravity of the
behaviour, alongside its intrinsic theoretical connections to conventional coups.
It therefore stands as the most accurate and analytically potent conceptual tool
for capturing and analysing such political phenomena, aligning perfectly with the
unified analytical framework this study seeks to establish.

#### Definition {#sec-definition .unnumbered}

While the use of precise terminology is undoubtedly important, a further
significant issue in previous definitions of autocoups lies in the identification
of their primary characteristic: is the central feature the expansion of power,
the extension of tenure, or a combination of both? This question arises from the
marked ambiguity surrounding existing definitions of autocoups and related
concepts.

Within political science, the notions of power expansion and tenure extension
frequently overlap or are applied ambiguously, thereby contributing to conceptual
confusion. To promote greater clarity, it is essential to delineate these two
frameworks more rigorously. Power expansion refers to the process by which an
incumbent accrues authority beyond their original constitutional remit—typically
through centralisation, the weakening of institutional checks and balances, or
encroachments upon other branches of the state, such as the legislature or
judiciary. Tenure extension, by contrast, concerns efforts by a leader to remain
in office beyond the term originally prescribed, often via constitutional
amendments, the postponement or manipulation of elections, or other mechanisms
intended to bypass term limits.

Many existing definitions of autocoups conflate these dynamics or
disproportionately emphasise power expansion. For instance, @cameron1998a defines
a self-coup as “a temporary suspension of the constitution and dissolution of
congress by the executive, who rules by decree until new legislative elections
and a referendum can be held to ratify a political system with broader executive
power” (p. 220). Yet the concept of “broader executive power” is inherently vague
and open to contestation. Similarly, the term incumbent takeover, defined as “an
event perpetuated by a ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal
and/or informal constraints on his/her power” [@baturo2022, p. 374], builds on
earlier work by @svolik2014 and centres on power expansion as well. However, the
dataset employing this definition encompasses both power expansion and tenure
extension. By contrast, the term overstay is clearly defined as “staying longer
than the maximum term as it stood when the candidate originally came into office”
[@ginsburg2011evasion, p. 1844], thereby focusing specifically on tenure
extension.

This thesis contends that tenure extension ought to be regarded as the primary
and defining characteristic of an autocoup, for several reasons. First, this
focus aligns autocoups conceptually with traditional coups. A classic coup is
typically characterised by the forcible and premature removal of a sitting
executive; it does not necessarily entail a reduction in the leader’s powers, but
rather a disruption of their tenure. By the same logic, an autocoup should be
defined by the prolongation of tenure, not solely by the expansion of executive
authority. An incumbent may experience a diminution of power while remaining in
office—such an instance would not be coded as a coup. Similarly, a leader who
consolidates authority without exceeding term limits would fall under the
category of executive aggrandisement, but not that of an autocoup.

Second, in practice, power expansion often functions as a strategic means to
enable tenure extension. The widely cited case of President Alberto Fujimori in
Peru exemplifies this dynamic. Although his 1992 actions involved the suspension
of the constitution and the dissolution of Congress, the ultimate objective was
to ensure continued rule. The 1993 Constitution permitted him to seek a second
term, which he won in 1995. Subsequently, a law of “authentic interpretation”
passed by his congressional allies enabled him to run again in 2000—a move
steeped in controversy. Although he secured re-election, his regime collapsed in
2000 amidst corruption and human rights scandals, prompting his flight to Japan
[@ezrow2019]. In this light, it is illogical for incumbents to consolidate power
unless they intend to overstay in office; such actions merely strengthen their
successors, whose interests may diverge from their own.

Third, the measurement of power expansion presents greater methodological
challenges than the identification of tenure extension. For example,
@cameron1998a defines a self-coup as involving both constitutional suspension and
congressional dissolution. Yet it remains unclear whether either act alone
constitutes an autocoup, whether both are required, or whether they should be
treated as distinct events. While the complexity of measurement ought not to
preclude the consideration of power expansion, a clear point of departure is
required. This study therefore designates tenure extension as the definitional
core of autocoups, leaving the broader discussion of power expansion (and its
inverse, power contraction) to future research.

Based on these considerations, this study defines an autocoup as:

> *The extension of an incumbent leader’s tenure in office beyond the originally
> mandated limit, achieved through extra-constitutional means.*

This definition places tenure extension at the centre of the concept, while
acknowledging that power expansion may coexist. First, the term incumbent leader
refers to the de facto national leader, irrespective of their formal title. For
instance, although Vladimir Putin formally stepped down as President of Russia in
2008 and assumed the premiership, effective political power remained in his
hands. During this period, the presidency—held by Dmitry Medvedev—functioned
largely as a symbolic office under Putin’s continued control [@chaisty2019]. To
ensure consistency and minimise arbitrariness, this study employs the Archigos
dataset [@goemans2009] to determine whether an incumbent has effectively remained
in power.

Second, although tenure extension is the definitional cornerstone, this framework
does not exclude simultaneous power expansion. Both may occur in tandem, but the
decisive criterion remains the act of exceeding one’s original time in office. In
the Fujimori case, for example, the 1992 actions were not coded as an autocoup
until the adoption of the 1993 constitutional amendment enabling his re-election.

Third, autocoups may be executed through both legal and illegal means. For
instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye postponed general elections until
1969 after coming to power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan President José Eduardo dos
Santos suspended elections during much of his nearly four-decade rule [@baturo].
These represent clear violations of constitutional norms. Other instances—such as
Putin’s 2008 manoeuvre—may not be overtly illegal but nonetheless undermine the
constitutional spirit intended to limit consecutive terms. Consequently, this
definition emphasises the functional illegitimacy of such actions, regardless of
their formal legality, particularly where the incumbent is the direct and
principal beneficiary.

Finally, an incumbent who seeks re-election in accordance with the existing
constitution is not engaging in an autocoup. However, should they subsequently
refuse to concede defeat and remain in power beyond their lawful mandate, such
conduct would indeed constitute an autocoup.

By clarifying these definitional boundaries, this chapter establishes the
conceptual foundation for the autocoup dataset introduced in the following
section.

### Introduction to the autocoup dataset

#### Defining the scope {.unnumbered}

Classifying political events as autocoups often necessitates addressing ambiguous
or borderline cases. To ensure consistency and minimise interpretive uncertainty,
this study adopts a coding strategy grounded in the definition articulated in the
preceding section. Specifically, only those instances in which incumbent leaders
extend their originally mandated term in office are coded as autocoups. Cases
involving power consolidation in the absence of tenure extension are excluded
from the dataset.

The temporal scope of the dataset spans the period from 1945 to the end of 2023,
reflecting the most recent data available at the time of compilation. The
geographical scope is global, encompassing leaders from all countries and
regions.

#### Classifying autocoups {.unnumbered}

In categorising autocoups, this study prioritises the methods employed by
incumbents, while outcomes constitute a secondary classificatory dimension.
Additional features are recorded where relevant information is available.

##### Evasion of term limits {.unnumbered}

One of the most prevalent tactics in autocoups is the evasion of term limits.
Incumbents deploy ostensibly legal mechanisms to prolong their hold on power,
primarily through the manipulation of constitutional provisions. Such manoeuvres
may include pressuring legislatures or courts to reinterpret term limits,
amending the constitution to allow extended terms, or replacing the constitution
entirely. In some instances, referendums are employed to confer a veneer of
democratic legitimacy. These extensions may range from the addition of a single
term to indefinite tenure.

**Changing the length of a term:** Incumbents may increase the duration of a
single term (e.g., from four to six years) without altering the number of terms
permitted. Examples include President David Dacko (Central African Republic,
1962), President Grégoire Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and President Augusto
Pinochet (Chile, 1988).

**Enabling re-election:** This involves modifying constitutional or legal
frameworks to permit re-election where it was previously barred. For instance,
President Carlos Menem of Argentina amended the constitution in 1993 to allow
himself to seek re-election, thereby extending his tenure.

**Abolishing term limits:** President Paul Biya of Cameroon successfully removed
presidential term limits in 2008, thereby enabling indefinite re-election.

**Declaring leadership for life:** This approach retains the semblance of
electoral competition, albeit often through manipulated or uncontested elections.
President Sukarno of Indonesia attempted to declare himself president for life in
1963, although this effort ultimately failed.

These strategies are frequently deployed in combination. For example, President
François Duvalier of Haiti first amended the constitution in 1961 to permit
immediate re-election and subsequently declared himself president for life in
1964.

##### Electoral manipulation and rigging {.unnumbered}

The second most frequently observed strategy in autocoups involves the
manipulation of electoral processes to ensure the incumbent remains in office.

**Delaying or cancelling elections:** The postponement of scheduled elections
without legitimate justification is a recurrent tactic. President François
Tombalbaye of Chad delayed general elections until 1969, having come to power in
1960. Similarly, President José Eduardo dos Santos of Angola suspended elections
throughout his tenure from 1979 to 2017.

**Rejecting unfavourable electoral outcomes:** Incumbents may refuse to concede
defeat and attempt to remain in office by unconstitutional means. A prominent
example is President Donald Trump of the United States, who declined to accept
the results of the 2020 presidential election and sought to overturn them.

**Electoral rigging:** Securing implausibly high vote shares is a key indicator
of electoral manipulation. This study codes elections in which incumbents receive
over 90 per cent of the vote as indicative of an autocoup. President Teodoro
Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently achieved over 95 per cent in
multiparty elections since 1996.

**Exclusion of opposition:** Preventing opposition parties or candidates from
contesting elections—thereby converting them into de facto uncontested
contests—is considered a clear indicator of an autocoup.

##### Installation of a figurehead {.unnumbered}

Some incumbents seek to circumvent term limits by installing a trusted proxy or
figurehead, thereby retaining de facto control over state affairs while
relinquishing formal office.

A paradigmatic example is the 2008 presidential transition in Russia. Confronted
with constitutional term limits, President Vladimir Putin endorsed Dmitry
Medvedev as his successor, who was duly elected. Medvedev then appointed Putin as
Prime Minister. Despite the formal shift in roles, most analysts agree that Putin
retained substantial influence, effectively rendering Medvedev a figurehead.

It is important that the identification of such cases be grounded in objective
criteria to avoid arbitrary classification. Accordingly, this study relies on the
Archigos dataset to determine leadership status. If a former officeholder is not
recorded in Archigos as the country’s leader—despite wielding informal power—they
are not coded as engaging in a figurehead-style autocoup within this dataset.

##### Reassignment of supreme authority {.unnumbered}

This strategy entails restructuring the constitutional or legal framework to
create a new, more powerful office, which the incumbent subsequently assumes
after formally leaving their original post.

In 2017, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan orchestrated a
constitutional referendum that transformed Turkey from a parliamentary to a
presidential system. The newly empowered presidency carried significantly
enhanced executive authority. Erdoğan then ran for, and won, the redefined
presidency, thereby maintaining control under a revised institutional
arrangement.

##### One-time extension arrangements {.unnumbered}

In certain cases, bespoke arrangements are enacted to extend an incumbent’s
tenure without altering the broader constitutional framework. These arrangements
are explicitly tailored to the current officeholder, with institutional rules on
tenure or term limits intended to resume their standard application for future
leaders. For example, in 2004, Lebanon extended President Émile Lahoud’s term by
three years through a one-off legal provision applying solely to his incumbency.

#### Data coding {.unnumbered}

The autocoup dataset is constructed on the basis of established datasets and
scholarly literature, thereby ensuring both reliability and comprehensiveness.
The principal sources employed for coding are listed in Table @tbl-source.

The Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political Leaders’ Affiliation
Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded] offer detailed records of national leaders
from 1875 to 2023. Although the temporal focus of this study is limited to events
occurring from 1945 onwards, these datasets are essential for identifying de
facto leaders and distinguishing them from nominal heads of state.

The Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022], which synthesises information from
eleven separate sources, provides a broad inventory of cases wherein executive
actors significantly curtailed institutional constraints on their authority. As
this dataset encompasses both power consolidation and tenure extension cases,
cross-referencing with Archigos and PLAD was necessary to determine whether
individual cases satisfied the definitional criteria for an autocoup.

```{r}

# nrow(Autocoup)
# nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))
# nrow(Autocoup) - nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))
```

In total, 83 events were identified and coded as autocoups. Of these, 50
correspond to entries within the Incumbent Takeover dataset, while the remaining
33 were newly identified and coded by the author through cross-verification with
supplementary materials, including Archigos, PLAD, and contemporary news sources.

Although a majority of cases originate from the Incumbent Takeover dataset, the
present study does not constitute a replication of that work. Of the 279 cases
catalogued in Incumbent Takeover, 229 were excluded from the current analysis on
the grounds that they entailed power consolidation without any accompanying
attempt to extend the leader’s tenure. Such instances lie beyond the definitional
scope of autocoups as operationalised in this thesis. This conceptual refinement
constitutes the principal point of departure from the Incumbent Takeover
framework.

The final dataset comprises 14 structured variables, in addition to a free-text
field for supplementary notes. The variables are as follows:

-   **Country identification:** Country code (ccode) and country name (country),
    following the standards of the Correlates of War project [@stinnett2002].

-   **Leader information:** Name of the de facto leader (leader_name), coded in
    accordance with the conventions employed in the Archigos and PLAD datasets.

-   **Timeline variables:** Date the leader assumed office (entry_date), date of
    departure (exit_date), date of the autocoup-defining event (autocoup_date),
    and commencement date of the extended term (extending_date).

-   **Power transition methods:** Mode of accession (entry_method), mode of
    departure (exit_method), and binary indicators for regular or irregular entry
    (entry_regular) and exit (exit_regular).

-   **Autocoup characteristics:** Method of tenure extension (autocoup_method)
    and outcome of the attempt (autocoup_outcome), categorised as: "failed and
    removed from office", "failed but completed original tenure", or
    "successful". For successful cases, the duration of the additional term is
    calculated as the interval between extending_date and exit_date.

-   **Data source:** The principal dataset from which the case was coded
    (source).

-   **Additional notes:** Contextual commentary on exceptional or borderline
    cases (notes).

Several coding challenges and methodological decisions warrant further
elaboration. In instances where tenure extensions occurred incrementally, the
`autocoup_date` corresponds to a pivotal event—such as the passage of a
constitutional amendment, a legislative vote, or the outcome of a referendum.
Where leaders attempted multiple autocoups, details are consolidated in the notes
field. Particular care was taken to distinguish between mere power consolidation
and explicit efforts to prolong tenure, which necessitated triangulation across
multiple sources. Furthermore, assessing the success or failure of an
autocoup—particularly in under-reported contexts—frequently required extensive
background research and qualitative judgment.

#### Data descriptions {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| label: data_descriptions

autocoup_desc <- Autocoup |>

  ) |>

```

The primary coding process identified 83 instances of autocoups between 1945 and
2023, spanning 63 countries. This comprehensive dataset provides a robust
empirical foundation for analysing trends and patterns in autocoup attempts
across a wide array of political and institutional contexts.

A breakdown of the methods employed by incumbents to extend their tenure is
presented in Table @tbl-autocoup_method. The most prevalent strategy is the
legalisation or reintroduction of re-election, accounting for 37 cases. This is
followed by the removal of term limits (10 cases) and the declaration of the
leader as president for life (7 cases). Other tactics, such as the cancellation
of scheduled elections or the refusal to concede electoral defeat, appear less
frequently. Electoral rigging is recorded in only one case—primarily because it
is often difficult to verify with certainty, despite strong indications in many
instances.

Autocoups exhibit a notably high overall success rate of $77\%$, in sharp
contrast to the approximate $50\%$ success rate observed in classical military
coups. Several factors may explain this discrepancy. First, incumbents possess
direct access to state resources and institutional mechanisms, which can be
deployed strategically to their advantage. Second, in contrast to the abrupt and
confrontational nature of traditional coups, autocoups tend to unfold gradually
and deliberately, affording incumbents time to consolidate elite support and
cultivate public legitimacy. Third, many autocoup strategies are implemented
under the guise of legality—via constitutional amendments or judicial
rulings—which reduces overt resistance and complicates efforts to mobilise
effective opposition. Finally, incumbents typically exercise considerable
influence over key state institutions, including the judiciary, legislature, and
security services, which facilitates the planning and consolidation of such
actions.

However, success rates differ markedly depending on the method employed. Certain
strategies appear to be consistently effective. For example, removing term
limits, cancelling elections, declaring oneself leader for life, delaying
elections, and installing figurehead successors all exhibit a $100\%$ success
rate within the dataset. Notably, these approaches represent some of the most
flagrant violations of constitutional norms concerning executive succession. This
pattern suggests that outcomes are shaped less by the degree of legal or
constitutional transgression than by the underlying distribution of political
power. In other words, the success of an autocoup is determined not by the
legality of the act, but by the incumbent’s capacity to control coercive,
judicial, and legislative institutions. Leaders who command overwhelming
authority are both willing and able to disregard constitutional constraints
precisely because their dominance insulates them from meaningful resistance.

By contrast, refusal to accept electoral defeat exhibits the lowest success rate,
with only one of four such attempts proving successful. Although the sample is
limited, this pattern may reflect the greater institutional resilience of
electoral democracies, stronger civil society mobilisation, more intensive
international scrutiny, and the inherently high-risk nature of overturning
electoral outcomes. These factors may increase the probability of failure for
incumbents who pursue this path.

Notably, in contrast to classical coups, which predominantly occur in autocratic
regimes, a substantial proportion of autocoups are carried out within democratic
settings. Of the 83 identified autocoup attempts, 30 took place in democracies—of
which 29 occurred in presidential democracies—constituting approximately $36\%$
of the total. By comparison, traditional coups have been significantly less
frequent in democratic contexts, with only 99 out of 493 cases ( $20\%$ ) taking
place in such regimes. This marked disparity will be examined in greater depth in
Chapter 3.

### Case studies

#### High frequency and success rate of autocoups in post-communist regimes

The dataset reveals a notably high incidence and success rate of autocoup
attempts in post-communist states. These countries, which were governed under
communist rule prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, have predominantly
transitioned into so-called ‘hybrid regimes’ [@nurumov2019], with only a few—most
notably China—retaining an overtly communist political identity. Within these
contexts, the dataset records 12 attempts by incumbents to extend their tenure,
of which only two were unsuccessful. A closer examination of these cases reveals
several shared structural and political characteristics.

Firstly, many post-communist regimes inherited authoritarian institutional
legacies. While they formally transitioned away from communism, these states
often preserved core authoritarian features, particularly the centralisation of
executive authority.

Secondly, elite continuity has been a hallmark of post-communist transitions.
Rather than a clear break with the previous regime, many transitions saw the
retention of former communist elites, who reconstituted themselves within
ostensibly democratic frameworks, frequently dominating newly formed political
institutions.

Thirdly, democratic procedures have frequently been subverted in post-communist
contexts. Although democratic reforms introduced elections and constitutional
term limits, the enduring institutional structures of communist rule have often
facilitated the manipulation of electoral processes and the circumvention of
formal constraints on executive power [@nurumov2019].

##### Lifelong ruler: Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus {.unnumbered}

Alexander Lukashenko, a former member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian
SSR, rose to national prominence as the head of Belarus’s interim anti-corruption
committee following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1994, he was elected
as the country’s first president, a position he has held continuously throughout
the period under examination. The original 1994 constitution imposed a two-term
limit on the presidency; however, this restriction was repealed in 2004 through a
constitutional amendment.

Since his initial election, international observers have consistently found that
Belarusian elections fall short of democratic standards. Despite sustained
domestic opposition and recurrent mass protests, Lukashenko has claimed repeated
re-election victories, frequently with vote shares exceeding 80 per cent. This
trajectory is emblematic of a broader pattern across the post-Soviet space,
particularly in Central Asia, where former high-ranking communist officials
transitioned into presidential office and have retained power with limited
institutional constraints.

##### Dynastic succession: Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan {.unnumbered}

Nursultan Nazarbayev served as the first president of independent Kazakhstan from
1991 until 2019. Prior to independence, he was the First Secretary of the
Communist Party of Kazakhstan, thereby exercising de facto leadership both before
and after the Soviet collapse. Following independence, Nazarbayev was elected
president and remained in power through a series of constitutional and legal
modifications, including the adoption of new constitutions that effectively reset
term limits.

Importantly, Nazarbayev did not formally abolish term limits. Rather, a
constitutional exemption was created specifically for the “First President”,
allowing him to circumvent term restrictions while maintaining a veneer of legal
continuity [@nurumov2019]. Unlike Lukashenko, who has remained in office
continuously since 1994 up to the time of this study, Nazarbayev formally
resigned in 2019, designating Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as his successor. However,
Nazarbayev continued to exercise significant influence through his position as
Chairman of the Security Council, a role he retained until 2022. This illustrates
the persistence of informal executive dominance even after nominal power has been
relinquished.

#### Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin America

Latin America has a longstanding tradition of imposing constitutional term limits
on executive authority. Simón Bolívar, often regarded as a founding father of
several Latin American republics, initially endorsed this principle, declaring in
1819 that “nothing is as dangerous as allowing the same citizen to remain in
power for a long time... That is the origin of usurpation and tyranny”
[@ginsburg2019, p. 38]. Although Bolívar later revised his stance—asserting in
his 1826 address to the Constitutional Assembly that "a president for life with
the right to choose the successor is the most sublime inspiration for the
republican order"—the concept of term limitation became deeply ingrained in the
region’s political culture. Indeed, approximately 81% of Latin American
constitutions adopted between independence and 1985 included some form of
presidential term limit [@marsteintredet2019a].

An analysis of autocoup cases in the region reveals two noteworthy patterns
regarding re-election dynamics.

##### Frequent success in breaking non-re-election rules {.unnumbered}

Unlike many presidential systems in which two consecutive terms are the norm,
Latin American constitutions have historically favoured more restrictive
arrangements. According to @marsteintredet2019a, $64.9\%$ of constitutions in the
region between independence and 1985 prohibited immediate re-election, while
$5.9\%$ forbade re-election altogether.

Nevertheless, adherence to these rules has varied. Countries such as Mexico,
which enshrined a strict non-re-election clause in 1911 at the outset of the
Mexican Revolution, have consistently upheld this restriction [@klesner2019].
Panama and Uruguay have similarly refrained from amending their re-election
provisions, while Costa Rica has permitted immediate re-election only briefly
(1897–1913) since its initial prohibition in 1859 [@marsteintredet2019a]. In
contrast, several states have frequently amended or circumvented their
constitutional term limits.

The pursuit of re-election or immediate re-election has often served as a central
motive for autocoup attempts aimed at consolidating executive power. This study
identifies 22 autocoup cases in Latin America, of which 14 (over $63\%$ )
involved efforts to enable re-election or immediate re-election. Of these, 9 were
successful, yielding a success rate exceeding $64\%$.

Importantly, not all such leaders sought indefinite tenure. Many stepped down
after securing and completing a second term. Notable examples include Fernando
Henrique Cardoso (Brazil, 1995–2003), Danilo Medina (Dominican Republic,
2012–2020), and Juan Orlando Hernández (Honduras, 2014–2022) [@ginsburg2019;
@marsteintredet2019a; @landau2019; @baturo2019; @neto2019].

##### Resistance to further extensions {.unnumbered}

The relative restraint exhibited by many leaders should not be interpreted as a
lack of ambition for further tenure. Rather, it reflects the fact that additional
extension attempts often failed, and incumbents acquiesced to these outcomes
without resorting to overt manipulation or repression.

While autocoups that enable a single additional term tend to be relatively
successful, efforts to prolong tenure beyond two terms encounter greater
resistance and are more likely to fail. Two contrasting cases illustrate these
divergent trajectories.

**Unsuccessful extension–Carlos Menem (Argentina):** President Menem secured a
second term following a 1994 constitutional amendment permitting one re-election,
and he was re-elected in 1995. However, his subsequent attempt to reset the term
count—arguing that his first term (1988–1995) had occurred under a previous
constitutional framework—was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court in 1999
[@llanos2019]. A comparable outcome was observed in the case of President Álvaro
Uribe in Colombia (2002–2010) [@baturo2019].

**Successful extension–Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua):** In contrast, President Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua succeeded in extending his tenure through a series of
judicial and legislative manoeuvres. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice
authorised his candidacy for the 2011 election. Subsequently, in 2014, the
National Assembly passed constitutional amendments abolishing presidential term
limits, thereby enabling Ortega to pursue indefinite five-year terms. He has
remained in office continuously since 2007 [@close2019].

#### As common as classical coups: Autocoups in African countries

```

Classical coups have historically been widespread across the African continent,
accounting for approximately $45\%$ of all coups globally—219 out of 493 recorded
incidents since 1950—affecting 45 of the 54 African states [@powell2011]. While
autocoups occur less frequently than traditional coups, they nonetheless
represent a significant political phenomenon within Africa. Of the 83 documented
cases of autocoups worldwide, $43\%$ (36 cases) have taken place on the
continent, spanning 29 countries. Notably, the success rate of African autocoups
exceeds $77\%$ (28 out of 36), a figure that significantly surpasses the regional
success rate for classical coups (approximately $50\%$ ) and aligns with the
global average success rate for autocoups ( $77\%$ ).

Identifying a clear and consistent pattern underlying autocoups in Africa proves
challenging—reflecting the broader analytical complexity associated with
classical coups. Several explanatory factors have been proposed in the
literature.

**Natural resource wealth:** States endowed with oil, diamonds, or other
strategic commodities often witness greater incentives and capacities among
incumbents to seek term extensions and consolidate power [@posner;
@cheeseman2015; @cheeseman2019a].

**Democratic quality:** The degree of democratic consolidation strongly
influences respect for constitutional term limits [@reyntjens2016].

**International influence:** External actors, including bilateral donors and
international organisations, may exert diplomatic or economic pressure to
dissuade leaders from subverting term limits [@brown2001; @tangri2010].

**Opposition strength and party cohesion:** The ability of opposition forces to
coordinate effectively, as well as the incumbent’s success in maintaining unity
within the ruling party, are critical factors shaping the feasibility of term
extension efforts [@cheeseman2019].

Drawing on the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, @cassani2020
identifies human rights abuses and the desire to evade legal or political
accountability as key motivations behind efforts to overstay in power. The more
authoritarian a leader’s governing style, the more likely they are to challenge
constitutional constraints. Moreover, incumbents who can secure the loyalty of
the military—often through strategic use of public investment—are significantly
more likely to succeed in extending their tenure.

Although both classical coups and autocoups continue to be features of African
politics, a marked shift has occurred since the end of the Cold War in 1991.
While the incidence of traditional coups has declined, autocoups have become
increasingly prevalent. This trend is partly attributable to the widespread
adoption of multiparty electoral systems in the 1990s, often accompanied by the
formal institutionalisation of presidential term limits [@cassani2020;
@cheeseman2019].

Prior to 1991, personalist and military regimes predominated across much of the
continent, and constitutional term limits were seldom enshrined. The post-Cold
War expansion of democratic frameworks contributed to a rise in the adoption of
such provisions, and, correspondingly, in attempts to circumvent them. However,
it is important to stress that this increase in challenges to term limits should
not be interpreted as indicative of declining compliance. On the contrary,
overall turnover in executive leadership has increased compared to earlier
decades, suggesting that while violations continue to attract attention,
adherence to constitutional rules has become more widespread.

### Summary

This chapter has offered a comprehensive analysis of autocoups, focusing on
political episodes in which incumbent leaders extend their tenure beyond
constitutionally prescribed limits. By refining existing definitions and
distinguishing autocoups from related concepts—such as self-coups, autogolpes,
and executive takeovers—the study introduces a novel dataset cataloguing 83 cases
of autocoups from 1945 to 2023, of which 64 were successful.

The revised conceptual framework, combined with the newly assembled dataset,
enables a more expansive and systematic analysis of irregular leadership
transitions. Whereas traditional scholarship has primarily centred on the
premature termination of leadership through coups, this study broadens the
analytical scope to encompass irregular tenure extensions. This approach yields a
more nuanced understanding of the ways in which incumbents may subvert
constitutional norms and democratic procedures to consolidate their authority.

Nonetheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the proposed
definition of an autocoup warrants further scholarly scrutiny and debate before
it can achieve broader consensus. Despite rigorous efforts to ensure consistency,
certain coding decisions—particularly in ambiguous or borderline cases—may
inevitably entail an element of subjective judgement. Second, while this thesis
concentrates on tenure extensions, instances involving the expansion of executive
power without a formal extension of tenure also deserve deeper conceptual and
empirical investigation.

Despite these constraints, the research makes a substantive contribution to the
literature on political stability, leadership dynamics, and democratic
resilience. The dataset provides a valuable empirical foundation for future
inquiries into the mechanisms and motivations underpinning autocoups.

Several promising directions for further research emerge. Subsequent studies
could utilise the dataset to examine the long-term institutional consequences of
autocoups, including their role in democratic backsliding, authoritarian
entrenchment, and the personalisation of executive power. Additionally,
comparative analyses between autocoups and classical coups may illuminate the
evolving strategies employed by incumbents to consolidate authority across
diverse regime types and political environments.

## Power Dynamics and Autocoup Attempts {#sec-chapter2}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter investigates the determinants of autocoup attempts, seeking to
enhance understanding of the political dynamics underpinning tenure extensions by
incumbent leaders. Addressing a gap in the literature, the study employs a
quantitative approach, utilising a bias-reduced logit model to explore the
relationship between regime type and the likelihood of autocoup occurrence.
Particular attention is paid to how regime type reflects the structural balance
of power between incumbents and potential institutional constraints or elite
challengers. The findings indicate that regime type is a significant predictor of
autocoup attempts. Specifically, personalist autocracies and presidential
democracies are shown to be substantially more likely to experience autocoups
compared to dominant party regimes. This increased propensity is discussed in
relation to the varying degrees of institutional constraints and power
configurations characteristic of different regime types, offering insights into
the structural conditions that facilitate or constrain such irregular power
consolidations.

### Introduction

As discussed in Chapter 2, the study of autocoups has been hindered by conceptual
ambiguity and a lack of systematic data, resulting in limited empirical analysis
of this phenomenon. To address this gap, the present chapter seeks to make a
substantive contribution by offering a quantitative analysis of the determinants
of autocoup attempts. Following the precedent set by empirical research on
classic coups, which has primarily focused on the factors precipitating coup
attempts [@gassebner2016], this chapter similarly investigates why some incumbent
leaders choose to extend their tenure through autocoups, while others do not.

The rationale for investigating the determinants of autocoups is threefold.
First, autocoups represent one of the most frequent forms of irregular leadership
transition, with over 100 documented cases since 1945 (as detailed in Chapter 2).
Their prevalence has increased notably since 2000, coinciding with the apparent
global decline in classic coups [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. Second, autocoups play
a critical role in shaping political stability and democratic trajectories,
frequently resulting in long-term institutional erosion. Third, understanding the
factors that drive autocoup attempts constitutes a foundational step for further
enquiry into their consequences. Without identifying the conditions under which
autocoups occur, it is difficult to assess how to prevent them or mitigate their
negative effects.

While autocoups differ fundamentally from classic coups—primarily in terms of the
actor initiating the event (the incumbent, rather than a power challenger)—the
two forms of power disruption share important features. Consequently, methods
commonly applied to the study of traditional coups can be usefully adapted for
the analysis of autocoups. Nevertheless, despite an extensive literature on coup
dynamics [@gassebner2016], many studies treat regime type as a mere background
condition or control variable, rather than as a central determinant of power
disruptions.

This chapter advances the argument that the risk of autocoup attempts is
significantly shaped by the structural balance of power embedded within a
regime's foundational type. It contends that the likelihood of an autocoup is
determined by the perceived power equilibrium between the incumbent leader and
potential institutional or elite challengers. This power configuration is
relatively stable over time, as it is both shaped by and constitutive of the
regime type itself [@geddes2014]. Accordingly, this study employs regime type as
a proxy for underlying power dynamics, enabling a more systematic investigation
of the structural conditions that facilitate or constrain autocoup attempts.

To empirically test this proposition, the chapter employs a probit regression
model to examine the strategic calculus of incumbent leaders. It argues that the
balance of power, as inferred from regime typology, is a key determinant of
whether an incumbent will initiate an autocoup.

Given the inherent difficulty in directly measuring the internal balance of power
within regimes, regime type is used as an operational proxy. The premise
underpinning this approach is that regime type fundamentally conditions the
distribution of authority, the strength of institutional constraints, and the
capacity of incumbents to subvert constitutional norms. By analysing variation
across regime types, this study provides deeper insight into the structural
factors that influence both the occurrence and outcome of autocoup attempts.

In light of the limited quantitative research on autocoups in the existing
literature, this thesis aims to make a pioneering contribution to their empirical
study by offering a theoretically grounded and methodologically robust analysis
of their determinants.

The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows. Section 2 examines the
dynamics and patterns of autocoup attempts and their outcomes. Section 3 outlines
the research design, methodology, and variables used in the analysis, offering a
clear account of the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents and interprets the
findings, identifying key trends and implications. Section 5 concludes the
chapter by summarising the main insights and considering their relevance for
understanding and mitigating the risks of autocoups.

### Dynamics of autocoup attempts

Much like traditional coup attempts, autocoups are driven by two fundamental
factors: the disposition of incumbent leaders—namely, their motivations and
willingness to act—and their capability, referring to the resources and
opportunities available to them. However, autocoups exhibit two notable features
that distinguish them from classical coups. First, whereas coups predominantly
occur in autocracies [@thyne2014], approximately one-third of recorded autocoups
have taken place in democracies, as documented in Chapter 2. Second, while the
success rate of traditional coups hovers around 50%, more than 80% of autocoup
attempts have succeeded, according to the autocoup dataset introduced in Chapter
2. These distinctions suggest that the disposition and capability dynamics
underpinning autocoups differ substantially from those governing traditional
coups. This section examines the complex dynamics of autocoup attempts, focusing
particularly on how the motivations of incumbents, the factors influencing
success, and the institutional structures of regime types shape a state's
vulnerability to such actions.

#### Motivations for autocoups {.unnumbered}

Incumbent leaders seeking to extend their tenure may be motivated by a variety of
considerations, which can broadly be categorised into three principal domains:
personal ambition, purported national interest, and self-preservation.

First, the pursuit of personal power serves as a powerful incentive for many
leaders. The ability to govern without institutional constraints grants them
control over national policy, access to significant state resources, influence
over the judiciary and legislature, and the prestige associated with continued
office. For some, the desire to secure a lasting political legacy—to be
remembered as a transformative figure in national history—further reinforces the
appeal of prolonged rule.

Second, incumbents often justify tenure extensions as being in the national
interest. A common argument posits that a single term is insufficient to complete
long-term reform or development agendas. In this framing, remaining in office is
presented as necessary for the successful realisation of ongoing projects,
thereby positioning the autocoup as a sacrifice for the greater good rather than
a personal power grab.

Third, autocoups can function as a mechanism for self-preservation. Leaders who
face potential prosecution for corruption, human rights abuses, or other crimes
may view tenure extension as a means of maintaining immunity. Moreover, those who
have accumulated significant political enemies during their time in power may
fear retaliation upon stepping down. In such cases, extending one’s rule is not
only about ambition but also about survival—shielding oneself from legal or
political retribution.

#### Power dynamics and autocoups {.unnumbered}

While motivations may spark an incumbent’s decision to initiate an autocoup, it
is often the capability to execute and sustain such an action that proves more
decisive. The relatively high frequency and strikingly high success rate of
autocoups—over 80%, compared to around 50% for traditional coups—suggest that
incumbents enjoy structural advantages when seeking to extend their tenure. These
advantages are not confined to autocracies but are also observable in
democracies, highlighting that the resources and institutional leverage available
to incumbents vary significantly across regimes.

This observation necessitates a closer examination of state power
structures—particularly the distribution of control over the armed forces.
Military allegiance is a critical determinant of autocoup success. If the armed
forces remain loyal to the incumbent, opposition—whether from civil society, the
judiciary, or the legislature—can be neutralised or marginalised. Conversely,
open defiance by military leaders or a refusal to intervene on behalf of the
executive can render an autocoup untenable.

However, it would be reductive to assume that nominal authority as
commander-in-chief translates into uncontested control. Just as it is simplistic
to attribute the occurrence of traditional coups solely to military power
[@singh2016], it is equally misleading to presume that incumbents uniformly wield
the loyalty of the armed forces. Formal titles belie the often complex and
fragile relationships that underpin military loyalty.

In autocratic contexts, the military may not adhere to constitutional norms, but
nor is it inherently loyal to the head of state. Executives rely on military
officers to implement commands, yet those officers may possess their own
ambitions or rival loyalties. For example, in 1971, Ugandan President Milton
Obote attempted to dismiss General Idi Amin. In response, Amin capitalised on his
influence within the armed forces to stage a successful coup, ousting Obote
[@sudduth2017].

In contrast, consolidated democracies typically institutionalise military
allegiance to the constitution rather than to individual officeholders. In the
United States, following the 2020 presidential election, General Mark Milley,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, publicly reaffirmed the military’s
commitment to constitutional principles:

> “We are unique among militaries. We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a
> tyrant or a dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual. We take an oath
> to the Constitution.”
>
> — (US Army Museum, 12 November 2020[^1])

In hybrid or fragile democracies, attempts to extend executive tenure can carry
higher risks. For example, in Niger (2009), President Mamadou Tandja’s efforts to
amend the constitution and secure a third term provoked a military coup in 2010
[@miller2016]. Similarly, in Honduras (2009), President Manuel Zelaya was removed
from office by the military after attempting to modify the constitution to allow
immediate re-election [@muñoz-portillo2019].

#### Regime types and autocoups {.unnumbered}

Given these complexities, a more effective analytical strategy involves assessing
the broader balance of power within political systems. Direct observation of this
balance is inherently difficult, so this study employs regime type as a proxy—a
method consistent with established approaches in comparative politics. Regime
types reflect the institutional architecture of power distribution, especially
regarding authority over military command, political appointments, and
policy-making.

Drawing on the classification by @geddes2014, autocratic regimes can be divided
as follows:

**Military regimes** are governed by a junta, typically composed of senior
military officers who collectively determine leadership and policy. Examples
include Brazil (1964–1985), Argentina (1976–1983), and El Salvador (1948–1984)
[@geddes1999].

**Personalist regimes** are centred around a dominant individual who exercises
unchecked authority over military, policy, and succession processes. Notable
cases include Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic (1930–1961), Idi Amin in
Uganda (1971–1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the Central African Republic
(1966–1979) [@geddes1999].

**Dominant-party regimes** entrust authority to a structured political party,
with the leader operating within, or as the head of, that organisation. Prominent
examples include the PRI in Mexico, CCM in Tanzania, and Leninist parties in
Eastern Europe [@geddes1999].

Among these, personalist regimes are particularly conducive to autocoups. The
concentration of power reduces institutional resistance, and loyalty from the
armed forces is often cultivated through personal patronage. Military regimes,
though rooted in armed power, frequently experience internal instability, making
them more vulnerable to traditional coups than to autocoups. Dominant-party
regimes are more ambiguous: while the leader may be constrained by party
structures, exceptionally strong party leaders may nonetheless initiate
autocoups—as evidenced by Xi Jinping (2018), operating under dominant-party
regimes.

Monarchies, though classified as autocracies, typically render autocoups
irrelevant, as monarchs usually serve for life by design.

An important clarification arises at this point: why would leaders in personalist
regimes feel compelled to extend their tenure, given the extensive authority they
already wield? The answer lies in the distinction between the scope of power and
its duration. While personalist rulers often exercise substantial control over
state institutions, many originally assume office through constitutional or legal
means and must incrementally consolidate power. In this context, autocoups serve
as formal mechanisms to institutionalise their dominance, converting de facto
authority into de jure permanence. This dynamic is exemplified by the multiple
tenure extensions pursued by Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko.

In post-Soviet Russia, President Boris Yeltsin oversaw the transformation of a
parliamentary system into a personalist regime. However, Yeltsin himself did not
overstay his term; instead, he selected Vladimir Putin as his successor. Upon
assuming office in 2000, Putin progressively extended his rule and has remained
in power since, utilising constitutional amendments and legal manoeuvres to
circumvent term limits.

Similarly, in Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko was elected president in 1994 under a
party-based regime. Within a year, he dismantled the existing political structure
and established a personalist system. Since then, Lukashenko has remained in
power through successive extensions of his tenure, further entrenching his
authority over time.

In democracies, autocoups exclusively occur in presidential systems. This
reflects the institutional leverage enjoyed by presidents, who are directly
elected, often command the armed forces, and may override or bypass legislative
decisions. Prime ministers in parliamentary systems, by contrast, are more
constrained. They are typically beholden to legislative confidence and may be
dismissed via no-confidence votes. Military command is often institutionally
separated from their authority. Consequently, prime ministers face more frequent
leadership turnover and fewer opportunities to extend their terms. For example,
in the UK, three prime ministers served in 2022; in Japan, there have been 36
prime ministers since 1945—an average of one every two years. By contrast, only
14 presidents have served in the United States over the same period, reflecting
greater institutional stability. Given these distinctions, presidential systems
provide a more conducive environment for autocoups—even in established
democracies—due to their centralised executive authority and command over the
military.

From this analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:

> **H3-1: *The likelihood of autocoup attempts varies significantly by regime
> type, with personalist autocracies and presidential democracies being the most
> susceptible, relative to other regime types.***

### Research design

#### Methodology {.unnumbered}

Given the binary nature of the dependent variable—whether an autocoup is staged
or not—this section initially employs a logit regression model to analyse the
determinants of autocoup attempts. This approach enables the identification of
statistically significant factors influencing the likelihood of such events, as
well as the direction and magnitude of their effects.

However, since the dataset comprises over 9,000 observations with only
approximately 80 instances of autocoups, the dependent variable qualifies as a
rare event. Standard maximum likelihood estimation methods such as probit or
logit may underestimate the probability of occurrence in such cases. To address
this issue and ensure more reliable inference, the analysis additionally applies
Firth’s Bias-Reduced Penalised Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Bias-Reduced
Logit), as proposed by @firth1993.

#### Data and variables {.unnumbered}

The principal dataset, covering autocoups and regime types, spans the period from
1945 to 2023. However, due to issues in data matching, there is some truncation,
and the actual range of usable data extends from 1945 to 2018. The dataset
encompasses approximately 9400 observations, of which 78 are instances of
autocoup attempts.

##### Dependent variable {.unnumbered}

The analysis utilises the autocoup dataset introduced in Chapter 2. This dataset
covers the period from 1945 to 2023 and records information on 107 autocoup
attempts. Descriptive statistics for these attempts, along with regime
classifications, are presented in Chapter 2.

**Autocoup attempt**: A binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt
occurred (coded as 1) or did not occur (coded as 0) in each country-year
observation.

##### Independent variables {.unnumbered}

As discussed, regime type constitutes the primary explanatory focus of the model.
Regimes are categorised according to the typology developed by @geddes2014 (GWF
dataset), distinguishing between military, personalist, and dominant-party
regimes, with democracies serving as the reference category.

Control variables are selected based on previous research into coup determinants,
predominantly encompassing factors such as economic performance, political
violence, and tenure in office. In addition, democratic level, population size
and a Cold War dummy variable are included as further controls.

**Economic Level:** Measured by GDP per capita, representing the general economic
wellbeing of a country. Data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset by @fariss2022,
expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP, per thousand).

**Economic Performance:** Assessed through the current-trend ($CT$) ratio, as
developed by @krishnarajan2019. This metric compares a country’s current GDP per
capita with the average GDP per capita over the preceding five years. A higher
$CT$ ratio signifies stronger economic growth. Formally:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \over {1 \over 5} {\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}
    \end{aligned}
$$

**Political stability:** Captured by a violence index reflecting the incidence of
internal and interstate conflict, derived from the “actotal” variable in the
Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset [@marshall2005current]. Scores range
from 0 (complete stability) to 18 (maximum instability).

**Days in office (log):** This variable records the natural logarithm of an
incumbent leader’s cumulative days in office in each year. Longer tenure is
posited to facilitate power consolidation, thereby making autocoup attempts more
feasible. Data are drawn from the Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the
Political Leaders' Affiliation Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded].

**Democratic level:** This variable employs the Polity V score to assess the
degree of democracy or autocracy in a given country. Developed by the Center for
Systemic Peace, the Polity V score evaluates regime authority characteristics on
a scale ranging from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), based on
indicators such as the competitiveness of political participation, the process of
executive recruitment, and the extent of constraints on executive authority
[@marshall].

**Population size:** The natural logarithm of national population is included to
control for the potential impact of population size on leadership stability.
Larger populations may pose greater governance challenges and amplify opposition.
Population data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset.

**Cold War:** Following the approach of prior studies [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023], a dummy variable, Cold War, is included to
capture differences across historical periods. This variable reflects the
relative scarcity of autocoup events between the 1960s and 1990, with a notable
increase thereafter.

This analysis utilizes a logistic regression model to examine the factors
influencing the likelihood of autocoup attempts. Given the nature of the
dependent variable (a binary outcome, autocoup attempt occurring or not) and
potentially rare events in certain categories, a bias-reduced logit model is
employed alongside the standard logit model. The bias-reduced logit approach is
generally considered more appropriate when dealing with datasets where the
outcome of interest is infrequent, as it helps to mitigate potential biases in
the coefficient estimates that can arise in standard maximum likelihood
estimation. Therefore, the following discussion of the results will primarily
focus on the estimates obtained from the bias-reduced logit model, presenting the
findings in terms of Odds Ratios (ORs) for ease of interpretation. Odds Ratios
provide a more intuitive understanding of the relationship between predictors and
the likelihood of the outcome compared to log odds.

The results from the bias-reduced logit model are presented in
@tbl-autocoupmodel. The primary hypothesis posits that the likelihood of autocoup
attempts varies significantly by regime type, with personalist autocracies and
presidential democracies being particularly susceptible relative to other regime
types. The model uses "Dominant Party" regimes as the reference category.

An examination of the regime type variables reveals strong empirical support for
key aspects of the hypothesis. Compared to dominant-party regimes, personalist
autocracies exhibit an estimated odds ratio of 2.07, which is statistically
significant (  $p<0.05$  ). This suggests that the odds of an autocoup attempt
are just over twice as high in personalist autocracies, holding all other
variables constant. Presidential democracies also display a markedly increased
likelihood of autocoup attempts, with an estimated odds ratio of 4.83 (  $p<0.01$
 ), indicating that the odds are approximately 3.8 times higher than in
dominant-party regimes, ceteris paribus. By contrast, military regimes,
parliamentary democracies, and those classified as “other” exhibit lower odds of
experiencing an autocoup relative to dominant-party regimes. However, of these,
only the “other” category achieves marginal statistical significance within the
model.

These findings strongly support the assertion that both personalist autocracies
and presidential democracies face a substantially higher risk of autocoup
attempts compared to dominant party regimes. The odds ratios for personalist
autocracies (2.13) and presidential democracies (4.83) are notably larger than
those for military, parliamentary democracy, and other regime types, providing
evidence that these two regime types are indeed more susceptible. This lends
considerable support to hypothesis.

Turning to the control variables in the bias-reduced logit model, several exhibit
statistically significant associations with the likelihood of autocoup attempts.
The logged Polity V score, a measure of democratic quality, is negatively
associated with autocoup occurrence (  $OR = 0.91$,  $p<0.01$  ), indicating that
more democratic regimes are less likely to experience such events. The Cold War
variable is likewise associated with a significantly reduced odds of autocoup
attempts (  $OR = 0.46$,  $p<0.01$  ), suggesting that such incidents were less
prevalent during the Cold War period. The logarithm of population demonstrates
marginal statistical significance and appears to have a negative relationship
with the likelihood of autocoups. By contrast, other variables—including GDP per
capita, GDP growth trend, political stability, and the log of days in office—do
not display statistically significant associations with the probability of
autocoup attempts within this model.

In summary, the bias-reduced logit model reveals that regime type is a crucial
determinant of autocoup attempts. Consistent with the hypothesis, personalist
autocracies and presidential democracies exhibit a significantly higher
likelihood of experiencing autocoup attempts compared to dominant party regimes,
and appear more vulnerable than other regime types examined. This highlights the
particular fragility within these political systems concerning attempts by
incumbents to extend their tenures through extra-constitutional means. The
analysis also confirms the importance of economic development (GDP per capita),
level of democracy (Polity 5 scores), and the historical context of the Cold War
in influencing the probability of autocoup attempts.

### Summary

This chapter presents a quantitative investigation into the determinants of
autocoup attempts, addressing a recognised gap in the existing literature often
hindered by conceptual ambiguity and limited systematic data. The study posits
that the risk of autocoup attempts is significantly shaped by the underlying
structural balance of power within a regime, operationalised here through regime
type. Employing both a standard logit model and a bias-reduced logit model, the
analysis reveals that personalist autocracies and presidential democracies
exhibit a significantly higher likelihood of experiencing autocoup attempts when
compared to dominant party regimes. Specifically, the odds of an autocoup are
estimated to be approximately three times greater in personalist autocracies and
four times greater in presidential democracies, relative to the reference
category.

This finding lends support to the hypothesis that these specific regime types are
particularly vulnerable to autocoups, suggesting a clear link between their
structural characteristics and the propensity of incumbent leaders to extend
their tenures extra legally. Beyond regime type, the study also identifies
economic development, the level of democracy, and the historical context of the
Cold War as influential factors. By examining the strategic calculus of incumbent
leaders across different regime types, this research provides valuable empirical
insights into the conditions that either facilitate or constrain autocoup
attempts, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of political
instability and democratic trajectories.

It is important to acknowledge certain complexities inherent in the analysis of
autocoups that warrant further study. Unlike traditional coups, which can
theoretically occur at any point and potentially multiple times within a short
period, autocoups initiated by incumbents appear to follow different temporal
patterns. For instance, an autocoup attempt may be less likely during the initial
phase of a leader's term compared to the period preceding the term's scheduled
expiry. Furthermore, while a leader successfully extending their tenure may
reduce the immediate likelihood of a subsequent attempt, particularly if a
life-long term is secured, it is also true that some leaders have successfully
extended their rule on multiple occasions (e.g., Presidents Putin and
Lukashenko). To render the analysis manageable within the scope of this study, a
simplifying assumption was made that an autocoup attempt occurs only once during
an incumbent leader's tenure. These temporal dynamics and the possibility of
repeat attempts by the same leader represent important avenues for future
research to build upon the foundational analysis presented here.

## Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival: A Comparative Analysis of Coup-installed and Autocoup Leaders

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter examines how the mode of power acquisition affects the tenure of
political leaders who rise to office through irregular means, with a particular
focus on those installed via coups and autocoups. It argues that political
leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups are more likely to
survive in office longer than those who are installed by coups. Contrary to this
initial hypothesis, the time-dependent Cox model reveals no statistically
significant difference in the risk of removal between coup-installed and autocoup
leaders once key covariates—particularly regime type—are accounted for. Instead,
the analysis highlights the decisive influence of regime characteristics on
leadership survival. Leaders in military, parliamentary, and transitional regimes
face significantly higher hazards of removal compared to those in dominant-party
systems. Additionally, higher levels of GDP per capita are associated with
greater leadership stability, while increased political violence correlates with
elevated risks of ousting. These findings suggest that structural and
institutional contexts, rather than the specific mechanism of accession, more
strongly shape the durability of irregular leadership. This study contributes to
the literature on political survival by emphasising the role of regime type and
political context in explaining leadership longevity following unconventional
accessions to power.

### Introduction

The enduring fascination with the longevity of political leaders has sparked
extensive research in political science, with scholars seeking to understand why
some leaders maintain power for decades while others are ousted in a matter of
months or even days. However, a specific subset of leaders—those who ascend to
power through coups or extend their tenure through autocoups—has received
relatively limited attention. Examining the tenures of these leaders is crucial,
as it sheds light on the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and their
implications for political stability and democratic processes.

In contrast to leaders who attain power through conventional means, those who
rise through irregular channels, such as coups or autocoups, present more complex
and intriguing cases for study. The Archigos dataset highlights the prevalence of
irregular power transitions. Between 1945 and 2015, over half of leaders who
assumed power irregularly also exited irregularly, a rate significantly higher
than that of leaders who accessed office through regular channels.

Coup-installed and autocoup leaders constitute a substantial portion of these
irregular cases. The Archigos dataset notes that of 374 leaders who exited
irregularly, 246 (65.8%) were ousted through coups. Furthermore, research by
@frantz2016 demonstrates that coup-related exits account for approximately
one-third of all exits in autocracies, surpassing any other transition type.
Additionally, the autocoup dataset, introduced in [Chapter 3](#sec-chapter3),
documents 110 autocoup attempts between 1945 and 2023, of which 87 were
successful.

  )
```

Measuring the tenure of coup-installed and autocoup leaders poses challenges due
to the inherent irregularity and uncertainty of their positions. Nevertheless, a
comparative analysis reveals that leaders who extend power through autocoups tend
to have longer average post-autocoup tenures (approximately `r avg$avg[1]` years)
compared to coup-installed leaders (approximately `r avg$avg[2]` years),
suggesting a potential tenure gap of over five years.

```

A preliminary log-rank test in survival analysis, as illustrated in @fig-logrank,
demonstrates a statistically significant difference between the tenures of
autocoup and coup-installed leaders. The survival curve for autocoup leaders
consistently exceeds that of coup-installed leaders, indicating longer survival
times and a reduced risk of ouster for autocoup leaders.

This study posits that the method of accession significantly influences
leadership longevity. Coup-installed leaders likely confront greater challenges
to their rule, resulting in shorter average tenures compared to autocoup leaders.
The analysis, employing Cox proportional hazards and time-dependent Cox models,
supports this hypothesis, demonstrating that autocoup leaders generally
experience longer tenures than coup-installed leaders.

This research offers two primary contributions to the field. First, it highlights
an understudied factor in leadership survival analysis: the impact of the method
of accession to power. The findings suggest that leader survival is influenced
not only by ruling strategies but also by the initial method of acquiring power.
Second, by employing survival models, this study provides empirical evidence of
the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and coup-installed
leaders. This insight may explain the increasing prevalence of tenure extensions
through autocoups since 2000, as more incumbents observe and potentially emulate
successful precedents.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a
comprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context
for this research. Section 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of
coup and autocoup leaders. Section 4 outlines the methodology and data used,
including the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of
leadership longevity. Section 5 presents the analysis findings and a detailed
discussion of the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes by synthesizing key
takeaways and exploring their broader implications for political stability and
democratic processes.

### Literature review

The longevity of political leaders, which varies widely across different regimes,
countries, and historical periods, has been a long-standing focus of research in
political science. This field can be divided into two interconnected areas:
regime survival and individual leader survival, which are distinct but related
concepts. Regime survival focuses on the endurance of political systems, such as
monarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures, while leader
survival concerns the duration of individual leaders' time in office.

Political survival patterns vary widely across different systems. Parliamentary
democracies (e.g., Japan, United Kingdom) often experience prolonged periods of
party dominance coupled with frequent leadership changes. Similarly, communist
regimes (e.g., China) typically demonstrate enduring party rule with more
frequent leadership transitions. Presidential systems (e.g., United States) and
many military regimes tend to exhibit more frequent changes in both ruling party
or junta and leader.

The existing literature on leader survival is extensive and multifaceted. Some
studies explore specific mechanisms influencing leadership longevity within
particular regimes, such as democracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies
[@davenport2021]. Others aim to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks
explaining leader survival across different political systems
[@buenodemesquita2003]. While a universal theory remains an aspirational goal,
the complexities of leadership survival across diverse regime types present
significant challenges.

Power transition mechanisms vary substantially across different types of regimes,
particularly between democracies and autocracies. Autocratic systems often
feature closed leadership selection processes, restricted to a narrow pool of
individuals. While some autocracies may hold elections, significant barriers to
entry for legitimate challengers typically persist. The opacity of selection
processes in autocracies makes it difficult to assess genuine levels of public
support compared to democracies. Conceptualizing selectorates or winning
coalitions, as proposed by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes problematic in many
autocratic contexts.

Given these complexities, focusing research on specific regimes or leader types
may be more fruitful. The study of irregular leaders, such as those who ascend to
power through coups or extend their tenures through autocoups, offers a
compelling avenue for research due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties
surrounding their leadership trajectories.

Two primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.
The first emphasizes objective factors and resources, such as personal competence
[@yu2016], societal stability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999;
@williams2011], natural resource endowments [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012;
@wright2013], and external support [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017]. The
second focuses on subjective factors and strategies, including political
policies, responses to opposition, and tactics for consolidating power
[@gandhi2007; @morrison2009; @escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].

Coups, a significant aspect of irregular leadership transitions, have received
considerable scholarly attention. Research has examined coup prevention
strategies [@powell2017; @sudduth2017; @debruin2020]. Studies have explored the
impact of coups on leadership and the subsequent actions of coup leaders
[@sudduth2017, @sudduth2018, @easton2018].

However, a significant gap remains in the literature regarding the comparison of
leadership survival between coup-installed and autocoup leaders. This study aims
to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership
survival for these two leader types.

By focusing on the comparison between coup-installed and autocoup leaders, this
study seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of political survival
in irregular leadership transitions. This approach may offer valuable insights
into the complex dynamics of leader longevity across different political
contexts.

### Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-installed leaders

The study of leadership survival within political systems presents considerable
challenges due to the opacity and complexity of power transitions. These
challenges, however, highlight the importance of such research, as it sheds light
on the often-overlooked dynamics of political leadership. While the survival
trajectories of political leaders are complex and varied, certain patterns do
emerge. Leaders of similar origin or regime type frequently exhibit comparable
characteristics, thereby enabling systematic and meaningful analysis.

#### Key definitions and scope

Before proceeding to a comparative analysis, it is essential to clarify several
key terms.

Firstly, coups and autocoups are defined in a manner consistent with Chapter 2 to
ensure conceptual clarity and analytical coherence throughout the study.

Autocoup leaders are defined as incumbent rulers who employ extra-constitutional
means to extend their tenure in office. Coup-installed leaders, by contrast, are
those who assume power following a successful coup, irrespective of whether they
personally participated in or instigated the coup. This inclusive definition
allows for the consideration of both coup perpetrators and those appointed to
lead in the aftermath, offering a comprehensive understanding of leadership
following regime change by force.

Three important clarifications are required. First, to facilitate a meaningful
analysis, this study focuses on leaders who remained in power for a significant
period, applying a minimum threshold of six months to both autocoup and
coup-installed leaders. This criterion serves to exclude brief or transitional
episodes of leadership, thereby enhancing the robustness of the findings
concerning survival dynamics.

Second, some overlap between these two leadership categories is possible. For
instance, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, President of Tunisia from 1987 to 2011,
assumed power through a bloodless coup that ousted President Habib Bourguiba on
grounds of alleged incompetence. Subsequently, in 2002, a constitutional
referendum—the first of its kind in Tunisia—enabled the president to seek an
unlimited number of five-year terms and raised the maximum age limit for
presidential candidates from 70 to 75 [@bonci2019]. Technically, this latter
manoeuvre might be classified as an autocoup. Thus, President Ben Ali could be
viewed as both a coup-installed and an autocoup leader. However, since Ben Ali
originally came to power through the 1987 coup and retained office continuously
thereafter, this study classifies him solely as a coup-installed leader. This
rule—namely, that a leader who initially assumes power via a coup shall be
categorised as coup-installed, even if they subsequently extend their rule by
general elections or extra-constitutional means—ensures analytical consistency
and prevents overlap between leadership types.

Third, this study focuses on comparing the post-autocoup tenure of autocoup
leaders with the post-coup tenure of coup-installed leaders. That is, any tenure
served by autocoup leaders prior to their tenure extension is excluded from the
analysis. This comparative approach is motivated by the relevance and shared
characteristics of these leadership types, particularly in terms of their
legitimacy deficits, uncertainty, and susceptibility to instability. By examining
these parallel yet distinct pathways to power, the study aims to elucidate the
factors that influence the longevity of leaders who rise to power through
irregular means.

#### Challenges in power consolidation

Both autocoup and coup-installed leaders confront distinct challenges in
consolidating their power, primarily stemming from the varying intensity of
issues related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. This disparity
creates an uneven playing field in terms of power dynamics, placing
coup-installed leaders at a significant disadvantage. @tbl-leaders provides a
comparative overview of the main features of autocoup and coup-installed leaders,
highlighting these key differences.

\elandscape

##### Illegitimacy {.unnumbered}

While both types of leaders suffer from a legitimacy deficit, the nature and
perception of this deficit differ significantly.

The illegitimacy coup-installed leaders is blatant and unambiguous, stemming from
the overt and often violent seizure of power. This overt act undermines
pre-existing norms and institutions, generating immediate domestic and
international condemnation.

In contrast, autocoup leaders employ a more subtle and deceptive strategy,
manipulating legal processes and institutions to create a façade of democratic
legitimacy. This veneer of legality, while often thin, can provide a degree of
cover and buy time for consolidating power.

##### Uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The irregular paths to power for both types of leaders create uncertainty about
the longevity of their rule and the mechanisms of their eventual departure.
However, the levels and sources of this uncertainty differ significantly.

Coup-installed leaders face a trifecta of uncertainties. First, the immediate
aftermath of a coup often involves a struggle for power within the junta or
ruling coalition, creating ambiguity about who will ultimately consolidate
control. Second, the tenure of coup-installed leaders is inherently precarious,
subject to internal rivalries, popular uprisings, or counter-coups. Third, the
lack of established succession mechanisms further amplifies uncertainty, making
it difficult to predict the transfer of power and potentially triggering future
instability.

While not immune to uncertainty, autocoup leaders generally present a clearer
picture. The question of who will rule post-autocoup is largely settled, as the
incumbent retains power. Furthermore, many autocoup leaders openly aspire to
extend their rule indefinitely or incrementally, attempting to establish a sense
of permanence. This perceived stability, whether real or manufactured, can
contribute to a more predictable political environment, at least in the short
term.

##### Instability {.unnumbered}

The awareness of shaky legitimacy and persistent uncertainty inevitably breeds
insecurity and a sense of crisis, forcing both autocoup and coup-installed
leaders to prioritize stabilization measures. However, the nature and intensity
of these challenges differ:

Coup-installed leadersface the daunting task of rapidly reshaping power dynamics,
often resorting to purges and crackdowns to eliminate potential adversaries and
consolidate control. This process of dismantling existing structures and building
new ones generates significant instability, potentially alienating former allies
and triggering resistance from various segments of society. The need to appease
powerful actors both domestically and internationally further limits their
options, forcing them into compromises that can undermine their authority and
long-term stability.

In contrast, autocoup leaders often benefit from a degree of continuity in regime
personnel and institutions. This relative stability allows them to implement
changes gradually, minimizing disruptions and mitigating potential backlash.
While they may still face opposition, they are less likely to confront immediate
and existential threats to their rule, providing them with more time and leverage
to consolidate power.

By understanding these contrasting challenges, we can better appreciate the
relative advantages and disadvantages faced by autocoup and coup-installed
leaders. This comparative perspective provides a nuanced framework for analyzing
the strategies these leaders employ to consolidate power and navigate the
perilous terrain of irregular leadership transitions.

#### Empirical evidence and hypothesis

Empirical evidence substantiates the disadvantage faced by coup-installed
leaders, revealing a complex interplay between historical precedent, power
consolidation challenges, and leadership longevity. This section presents key
data points and introduces the central hypothesis guiding this study.

Data analysis shows a significant correlation between the frequency of coup
attempts in a country and the likelihood of future coups. Notably, over a third
of coups have occurred in the top ten countries with the most attempts since 1950
[@powell2011]. This pattern suggests a self-reinforcing cycle of political
instability, where each successful coup increases the probability of subsequent
attempts, creating an environment of persistent uncertainty for coup-installed
leaders.

The disparity in leadership longevity between autocoup and coup-installed leaders
is starkly illustrated by survival data. As depicted in @fig-logrank, the average
survival period following an autocoup is approximately five years longer than
that of coup-installed leaders. This substantial difference in tenure length
underscores the divergent challenges faced by these two types of leaders in
maintaining their grip on power.

The distinct challenges faced by autocoup leaders and coup-installed leaders in
consolidating power create a self-perpetuating cycle that significantly
influences their tenure length.

Coup-installed leaders face greater legitimacy challenges and internal
instability; Struggle to attract and retain strong support; More vulnerable to
internal and external challenges; Shorter average tenures reinforce perception of
instability.

Autocoup leaders often benefit from a veneer of legitimacy and a stronger initial
position; Better able to consolidate power and attract supporters; Face less
immediate threat of overthrow; Longer average tenures contribute to perception of
stability.

This cycle suggests that the initial method of power acquisition or extension has
far-reaching consequences for a leader's ability to maintain their position over
time.

Based on these observations and the theoretical framework outlined earlier, I
propose the following hypothesis:

***H4-1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups
are more likely to survive longer extended tenure compared to coup-installed
leaders.***

This hypothesis encapsulates the expected outcome of the divergent challenges and
advantages faced by autocoup and coup-installed leaders. By testing this
hypothesis, I aim to quantify the impact of the method of power acquisition or
extension on leadership longevity, contributing to a more nuanced understanding
of political survival in contexts of irregular transitions.

### Research design

This section employs survival analysis to test the hypothesis that autocoup
leaders have longer survival times in office compared to coup-installed leaders.
This study uses Cox models to analyze the survival tenures of autocoup and
coup-installed leaders, controlling for various factors that may affect their
time in office.

#### Methodology: Survival analysis

Two Cox models will be employed to analyze the survival tenures of coup-installed
and autocoup leaders:

**Cox proportional hazards (PH) model**: This model uses only the variables
present at the entry year, without considering changes over time.

**Time-dependent Cox model**: This model accounts for variations in
time-dependent control variables such as economic performance and political
stability.

The Cox model is preferred over the Kaplan-Meier model because it enables the
estimation of the impact of multiple factors. Although it does not directly
estimate the duration of tenure, it assesses the hazard rate associated with
being ousted from power. This approach captures different facets of the same
phenomenon: as a leader's cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their
probability of survival in office decreases.

#### Data and variables

The dependent variables include survival time and end point status:

**Survival time** refers to the duration of a leader's tenure, measured in days.
For coup-installed leaders, the survival time begins on the day they assume power
through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time starts on the expiration
date of their original legitimate term. For example, Russia's president Vladimir
Putin assumed power in 2000 and, after serving two terms, stepped down in 2008.
However, he remained in a powerful position as the prime minister and hand-picked
Dmitry Medvedev to succeed him as president, while continuing to control the
power behind the scenes. In this case, Putin's survival time begins in 2008,
marking the start of his post-autocoup tenure. The survival time concludes on the
day the leader finally exits office, applicable to both coup-installed and
autocoup leaders.

**End point status** indicates the manner in which the leader's tenure concluded,
categorized as follows:

-   **0 = Censored:** This status is assigned to leaders who leave office through
    regular means other than being ousted. This includes leaders transferring
    power to their designated successors, leaving office as their terms expire,
    losing in general elections, voluntarily leaving office due to health issues,
    or dying of natural causes.

    **1 = Ousted:** This status is assigned to leaders who are forced to leave
    office. This includes leaders resigning under pressure, being ousted by coups
    or other forces, or being assassinated.

The key independent variable is the leader type, which categorizes leaders into
two distinct groups:

-   **Group A = Autocoup leader**: Leaders who extend their tenure through
    autocoups.
-   **Group B = Coup-installed leader**: Leaders who assume power through coups.

This variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the
basis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.

The data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from the
autocoup dataset introduced in this study, Archigos, and PLAD.

Control variables include regime types, economic performance, political
stability, population size, and Polity V scores which are consistent with the
autocoup analysis in Chapter 3.

The two models yield divergent findings concerning the central question of this
study. The Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model indicates a marginally
statistically significant relationship between leadership type and the risk of
removal from power ( $p<0.1$ ). This result supports the hypothesis that leaders
installed via coups face a 1.78 times greater hazard of removal compared to those
who came to power through autocoups. However, the time-dependent Cox model finds
no statistically significant association in this regard. As the time-dependent
model incorporates covariates that vary over time, the subsequent interpretation
of the primary findings is grounded in this more refined specification.

According to the time-dependent Cox model, and contrary to the initial hypothesis
and earlier analysis, the mode of accession to power does not significantly
affect the tenure of irregularly inaugurated political leaders once relevant
covariates—particularly regime type—are accounted for. Nevertheless, the findings
derived from survival modelling reinforce the conclusions drawn in Chapter 3: the
balance of power, fundamentally shaped by regime characteristics, is central to
both the seizure and maintenance of political authority.

More specifically, regime type significantly influences the hazard of removal.
Leaders within military regimes exhibit a hazard ratio of 2.06 relative to their
counterparts in dominant-party regimes, all else being equal. This suggests that
military leaders face a notably greater risk of being ousted. At any given time
during their rule, military regime leaders are 1.06 times more likely to be
removed than those in dominant-party regimes, under the same model conditions.
Leaders under "other" regimes—typically provisional or transitional—display a
hazard ratio of 2.57, a statistically significant result that aligns with their
inherently unstable nature.

Economic development, proxied by GDP per capita, exerts a statistically
significant influence in the time-dependent model. A hazard ratio of 0.95 implies
that each additional \$10,000 in GDP per capita reduces the risk of removal by
$5\%$, holding all other variables constant. Political stability, as measured by
the violence index, indicates that a one-unit increase in the index corresponds
to an $9\%$ rise in the hazard of removal from office.

Other control variables—namely GDP growth trends, the logarithm of population
size, and Polity V scores—do not exhibit statistically significant effects on the
likelihood of political removal in the time-dependent Cox model. Although these
variables are theoretically relevant and commonly included in models of political
survival, their lack of significance suggests that, within the context of
irregular leadership transitions, structural economic growth, demographic scale,
and broader democratic indicators may exert less immediate influence on leader
vulnerability than more proximate factors such as regime type and political
stability. It is possible that their effects are either mediated by other
included variables or require a longer time horizon to manifest in measurable
political outcomes. This underscores the importance of distinguishing between
long-term institutional features and short-term political dynamics when assessing
leader survival.

Figure @fig-coxHR presents the hazard ratios and their corresponding $95\%$
confidence intervals for the variables included in the Cox proportional hazards
model. The proximity of a hazard ratio (depicted as dots) to 1 indicates a
minimal effect of that variable on the risk of removal from power; a hazard ratio
of 1 denotes no effect. The horizontal lines extending from the dots represent
the $95\%$ confidence intervals. If these intervals intersect the vertical blue
line at 1, the variable is not statistically significant at the $5\%$ level.

As previously discussed, the hazard ratios for leaders in military regimes and
those classified under “Other” coup-installed regimes are significantly greater
than 1 and are statistically significant at the $5\%$ threshold. Although GDP per
capita is also statistically significant at this level, its hazard ratio is very
close to 1, indicating a limited substantive effect.

While the hazard ratios for GDP growth trend and for parliamentary and
presidential regimes appear visually distant from 1, they are not statistically
significant at the $5\%$ level, as their confidence intervals cross the vertical
reference line.

Most other variables exhibit hazard ratios near 1, suggesting that a one-unit
change in these variables does not meaningfully influence the likelihood of a
leader being ousted.

#### Assessing the proportional hazards assumption

Evaluating the proportional hazards assumption is essential for ensuring the
validity of the Cox model estimates. This assumption is tested using a chi-square
test based on Schoenfeld residuals, which assesses whether the effects of
covariates remain constant over time. The results indicate that neither the
standard Cox proportional hazards model nor the time-dependent Cox model violates
this assumption. The global p-values—0.12 for the standard model and 0.23 for the
time-dependent model—both exceed the conventional $5\%$ significance threshold,
suggesting that the proportional hazards assumption is reasonably upheld in both
cases.

### Summary

This chapter examined the survival durations of political leaders who assumed
office through irregular means—specifically coups and autocoups—using survival
analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a
time-dependent Cox model. While the standard Cox model suggested a marginally
significant difference in tenure risk between autocoup and coup-installed
leaders, this association was not statistically significant in the time-dependent
model, which offers a more robust specification by accounting for time-varying
covariates.

The findings indicate that, once regime type and other relevant covariates are
controlled for, the method of accession—whether by coup or autocoup—does not
independently predict leader survival. Instead, regime type emerged as a key
determinant. Leaders operating within military and transitional ("other") regimes
faced significantly higher risks of removal compared to those in dominant-party
systems. Additionally, economic development, proxied by GDP per capita, and
political stability, measured by a violence index, were found to significantly
influence tenure length, whereas GDP growth, population size, and democratic
scores (Polity V) were not statistically significant.

These results reinforce the central argument that the institutional
context—particularly regime characteristics—plays a more decisive role in
determining political longevity than the initial mode of power seizure. This
finding aligns with earlier qualitative assessments and underscores the necessity
of incorporating institutional and structural variables when analysing political
survival.

Methodologically, the chapter demonstrates the value of time-dependent modelling
in political science, especially when covariates evolve over time. It also
contributes to the emerging literature on autocoups by offering one of the first
systematic analyses of their implications for political survival. However, the
reliance on a newly constructed dataset for autocoups presents limitations,
highlighting the need for continued refinement and expansion in future research.

In sum, this chapter provides empirical support for the proposition that regime
characteristics, more than the method of accession alone, shape the durability of
irregular political leadership. These insights contribute to broader debates on
authoritarian resilience, democratic backsliding, and the institutional
foundations of political power.

## Coups, Autocoups, and Democracy

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter explores the impact of autocoups on political institutions, drawing
comparisons with traditional coups through an analysis of changes in Polity
scores. I contend that, first, incumbent leaders frequently consolidate power by
undermining established institutions in anticipation of an autocoup, resulting in
a decline in Polity scores even prior to the event. Second, unlike coups, which
produce mixed outcomes regarding democratization, autocoups almost invariably
lead to democratic backsliding or authoritarian entrenchment, as they are
specifically designed to dismantle institutional checks, enabling leaders to
maintain power for significantly longer periods than those installed via coups.

Employing a country-fixed effects model and utilizing datasets on both autocoups
and coups, this study reveals that Polity scores decline both preceding and
following an autocoup, while coups tend to trigger an immediate decrease that may
allow for some degree of democratic recovery over time. These findings underscore
the divergent political trajectories associated with coups and autocoups. This
research not only addresses a critical gap in the empirical analysis of autocoups
but also significantly raises awareness within academic and policy-making circles
regarding their potential adverse effects, including democratic backsliding and
further authoritarian deterioration.

### Introduction

In the preceding chapters, I clarified the definition of an autocoup, introduced
a novel dataset on autocoups, conducted empirical analyses on the determinants of
autocoup attempts, and compared the post-event survival times of leaders
established through coups versus autocoup leaders. A natural follow-up question
emerges: What are the broader impacts of autocoups? Specifically, from a
political science perspective, how do autocoups affect the process of
democratization?

As previously noted, due to the absence of a widely recognized dataset on
autocoups, most existing discussions on their impact have relied on case studies
[@baturo; @baturo2022]. To move beyond case-specific analyses and adopt a more
systematic and comparative approach, this chapter aims to pioneer empirical
research on the democratic consequences of autocoups. The first objective of this
chapter, therefore, is to examine whether autocoups reinforce authoritarianism,
promote democratization, or have no significant effect on political regimes.

Given the conceptual and empirical connections between coups and autocoups,
another key objective is to compare their respective effects on democratization.
While both events disrupt existing political orders, their immediate and
long-term consequences may vary significantly. Understanding these distinctions
is essential for evaluating their broader implications.

To address these questions, this study leverages data from a widely recognized
coup dataset alongside a newly compiled dataset on autocoups. Employing a
fixed-effects model, it evaluates their effects on democracy, as measured by the
Polity Index. The findings reveal that both coups and autocoups lead to an
immediate decline in democratic levels. However, coups have a more pronounced
negative short-term impact. Notably, three years after these events, democracies
affected by coups tend to show significant recovery, whereas those experiencing
autocoups exhibit no meaningful improvement.

This study offers two significant contributions to the field of political
science. First, it provides the inaugural empirical analysis of the impact of
autocoups on democratization, effectively addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature. Second, by directly comparing the effects of coups and
autocoups, this research highlights autocoups as a distinct phenomenon that
demands increased scholarly inquiry and policy focus.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 analyzes the
impact of autocoups on democratization, by comparing the effects with traditional
coups. Section 3 outlines the research design, methodology, and variables used in
this study. Section 4 presents and interprets the empirical findings, followed by
a discussion of their implications. Finally, Section 5 concludes by summarizing
the key results and exploring their significance for understanding and mitigating
the occurrence of autocoups.

### Impact of autocoups on political change

According to the definition in Chapter 2, an autocoup refers to an incumbent
leader extending their tenure in power beyond the originally mandated limits,
whether through legal or illegal means. While the leader may assume a different
title or position, the individual in power remains unchanged. Therefore, unlike
traditional coups, an autocoup does not result in real leadership turnover, elite
restructuring, or regime change. In other words, the fundamental ruling structure
remains intact.

This distinction has important implications. Since regime change rarely occurs
following an autocoup, its impact on politics cannot be assessed using
conventional methods. Typically, studies on coups and democratization measure
their effects by estimating the probability of regime transition—either from
autocracy to democracy or vice versa—as seen in previous research on coup
outcomes [@thyne2014; @derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016]. However, this approach is
not suitable for autocoups, as they do not directly trigger regime transfers.

Although autocoups rarely lead to formal regime change, this does not mean they
have no impact on political dynamics. In fact, they inevitably shape political
trajectories in various ways and, on occasion, can even lead to significant
transformations. Therefore, a more appropriate method for assessing the political
impact of autocoups is to analyze democratic indices, such as those measured by
Polity5 [@p1]. The Polity Score, ranging from -10 (full autocracy) to +10 (full
democracy), captures gradual shifts in political regime characteristics rather
than abrupt transitions. Thus, even if an autocoup does not result in a formal
regime change, subtle shifts in political openness and institutional constraints
can still be assessed by examining variations in Polity scores before and after
the event. This approach has also been employed in previous studies [@dahl2023].

Although autocoups may not lead to significant regime change, their impact on
democratization should not be overlooked. However, their influence differs from
that of traditional coups in at least two key ways.

#### **The pre-emptive effects of autocoups on political dynamics**

First and foremost, unlike coups, which are marked by clear, decisive events—such
as the removal of a leader—autocoups typically unfold gradually, through
incremental steps rather than a singular, dramatic event. Incumbent leaders
seeking to extend their tenure often lay the groundwork well in advance before
executing their final move to remain in power. To reduce resistance and
opposition, they engage in extensive preparation, which may include purging
officials, suppressing political opposition, cracking down on dissent and
protests, and restricting press freedom. Without such measures, an autocoup might
face strong internal resistance, and in the worst case, provoke a backlash that
not only derails the leader’s attempt to extend their rule but also results in
their immediate removal from office.

However, once an incumbent successfully secures an extension of their rule,
continued repression is not always necessary. On the contrary, some leaders relax
political pressure to ease internal dissent and mitigate opposition from external
actors. This adaptive approach helps maintain stability after the autocoup is
complete.

As a result, the primary impact of autocoups on political change is often
reflected in shifts in political scores before the final stage of the autocoup is
enacted. Once the process is completed, further shifts may be minimal. In
contrast, coup plotters, unlike incumbents, lack the ability to influence
political institutions beforehand, meaning their impact on politics is often felt
in the aftermath rather than before the event.

This distinction is evident in empirical cases of autocoups.

One of the most frequently cited examples of an autocoup is Peru’s 1992 case, in
which President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the
1979 Constitution, and ruled by decree until November of that year, when a
*Democratic Constituent Congress* was elected to draft a new constitution
[@cameron1998]. However, these moves did not immediately grant Fujimori a longer
tenure in office.

Under the 1979 Peruvian Constitution, immediate presidential re-election was
prohibited. To bypass this restriction, Fujimori initiated a constitutional
overhaul, leading to the adoption of a new constitution in 1993, which permitted
re-election. Consequently, he secured a second term in 1995 [@baturo2019].

An analysis of Peru’s Polity5 scores during this process reflects these political
changes. Upon taking office in 1990, Peru’s Polity score was 8, remaining
unchanged in 1991. However, a dramatic shift occurred in 1992, when Fujimori
dissolved Congress, causing the Polity score to plummet from 8 to -4.
Interestingly, when he formally extended his rule by amending the constitution in
1993, the score rebounded slightly to -1. This -1 score remained unchanged
throughout Fujimori’s tenure until 2000, indicating a lack of further
institutional transformation after the constitutional amendment.

A similar pattern emerges in Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko. Upon assuming
office as president in 1994, Belarus had a Polity5 score of 8. However, in 1995,
when Lukashenko moved to hold a referendum—defying opposition in the Supreme
Council and threatening to suspend its activities—the score dropped sharply to 0.
Following the 1996 referendum, which extended his term by two additional years,
Lukashenko officially overstayed his tenure. Consequently, the Polity5 score
further declined to -7 in 1996, where it has remained ever since, despite two
additional term extensions [@ash2014; @baturo].

These cases illustrate a broader pattern: the impact of autocoups on political
change is often reflected before the final stage of the autocoup is enacted,
whereas the impact of coups tends to materialize afterwards, as have been fully
discussed by previous studies.

Based on this analysis, I propose the first hypothesis:

> *H1*: Autocoups primarily shape political change in advance, whereas coups
> typically drive political change only after they are executed.

#### **The singular nature of autocoups**

Secondly, in contrast to the ambiguous nature of coups [@dahl2023], the impact of
autocoups on political change rarely contributes to democratization.

The influence of coups on democratization has been extensively examined in
existing literature. Some scholars argue that coups—and even the mere threat of
them—can act as catalysts for democratization. One argument suggests that coups
deliver a political "shock" that may create opportunities for liberalization that
would not have otherwise materialized [@thyne2014]. In a critical examination,
@derpanopoulos2016 questioned the role of coups in promoting democracy, engaging
in multiple rounds of debate with @miller2016. More recently, @dahl2023 further
explored this ongoing discussion, arguing that both democratic and autocratic
transitions are likely to follow a coup, with popular mobilization playing a
decisive role in shaping post-coup trajectories.

A frequently cited example of a “pro-democracy coup” occurred in February 2010,
when Nigerien troops ousted President Mamadou Tandja after he extended his rule
autocratically. The Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD) took
control, pledging democratic reforms. Their actions were widely celebrated, with
both citizens and political opposition viewing the coup as an opportunity to
restore democracy. The CSRD fulfilled its commitment by overseeing free and fair
elections in 2011, resulting in Mahamadou Issoufou assuming the presidency
[@miller2016].

While the debate on the democratic consequences of coups remains ongoing, it is
evident that their impact is not uniform. In contrast, autocoups almost never
lead to democratic transitions, nor do they even marginally enhance political
freedoms. This stems from the intrinsic nature of autocoups, which disrupt the
established process of political leadership transition, particularly term limits.

Term limits are constitutional provisions that restrict the maximum duration a
leader can remain in office. They play a crucial role in both democracies and
autocracies by preventing the excessive concentration of power and ensuring
political stability. In democracies, term limits promote accountability,
leadership renewal, and reduce the risks of corruption and authoritarian
entrenchment. In autocracies, when enforced, they can curb indefinite rule,
mitigate succession crises, and provide rare opportunities for political
transitions. However, without term limits, leaders can entrench themselves in
power, undermining institutions and hindering political progress.

As shown in @tbl-autocoup_method in Chapter 3, autocoups are executed through
either façade legal mechanisms or blatantly illegal methods. This includes
amending or disregarding term limits, delaying or cancelling elections, rigging
electoral outcomes, or outright refusing to accept election results. While many
autocoups maintain a veneer of legality, their defining characteristic is the
violation of term limits, which are intended as safeguards against prolonged and
unchecked rule.

As previously discussed, before an incumbent leader formally overstays their
term, they often inflict significant damage on political institutions.
Furthermore, to secure their prolonged rule, they are unlikely to fully restore
political freedoms even if they temporarily ease political repression once they
have consolidated power.

Case studies from Peru and Belarus illustrate how autocoups lead to a decline in
Polity scores, reflecting democratic backsliding. However, most autocoups occur
in already autocratic regimes where Polity scores are low. This aligns with
trends observed in coups, which also primarily occur in autocracies.

For instance, in China’s 2018 constitutional amendment, Xi Jinping abolished
presidential term limits, effectively allowing himself to remain in power
indefinitely[^2]. However, China’s Polity score remained unchanged at -7 before
and after the amendment. This pattern is common in autocratic regimes with Polity
scores below -6, as they already lack significant democratic features, leaving
little room for further decline.

While most autocoups occur in low-Polity-score countries, some have taken place
in relatively democratic settings, where the Polity score remains stable despite
term limit extensions. This is particularly evident in Latin America, where
presidents have amended "no immediate re-election" rules to allow for a second
consecutive term, but voluntarily stepped down afterwards. Examples include:
Argentina (1993), Polity score remained at 7; Brazil (1997), Polity score
remained at 8, Colombia (2004), Polity score remained at 7. In these cases,
leaders extended their tenure within a structured political framework without
further dismantling democratic institutions [@baturo2019].

Across all cases—whether in Peru, Belarus, China, Argentina, Brazil, or
Colombia—there is no instance where a Polity score increased following an
autocoup. In the autocoup dataset which I introduced in Chapter 3, only four
cases—Guinea-Bissau (1988), Burkina Faso (1997), Congo-Brazzaville (2001), and
Lebanon (2004)—saw minor increases in Polity scores, but the changes were
insignificant.

Thus, unlike some coup leaders who justify their actions by claiming to restore
democracy (as seen in Niger’s 2010 case), leaders who execute autocoups lack any
democratic justification. If their true intention were to advance democracy, they
would transfer power peacefully rather than violate term limits.

Based on this analysis, I propose the second hypothesis:

> *H2*: Autocoups are more likely to entrench autocracy than coups.

### Methodology and variables

#### Methodology

As discussed earlier, autocoups are less likely to result in full regime
transitions—either from democracy to autocracy or vice versa. Therefore, it is
inappropriate to assess their effects solely based on regime transitions or
changes that cross a critical threshold. Instead, this study examines political
changes through fluctuations in Polity5 scores.

Unlike coup analysis, which primarily focuses on post-event effects, this study
examines both pre-event and post-event impacts of autocoups. Specifically,
pre-event effects are measured by the change in Polity5 scores three years before
the autocoup compared to the year of the autocoup, expressed as:

$Polity_t - Polity_{t-3}$

Post-event effects are measured by the change in Polity5 scores three years after
the autocoup compared to the year of the autocoup, expressed as:

$Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t$

The three-year window is chosen for two key reasons. Pre-event political changes
typically occur incrementally, as incumbents consolidate power gradually over
several years rather than through a single, abrupt action. Post-event analysis
focuses on medium-term effects rather than short-term shocks, as autocoups rarely
trigger immediate regime transitions and instead reinforce existing political
structures. Short-term fluctuations may be too minor to capture meaningful
institutional change empirically.

To estimate how political institutions change before and after autocoups, I
employ a linear model with country-case fixed effects. For pre-event effects, I
analyze attempted autocoups, since before the event, no one knows whether the
autocoup will succeed or fail.

For post-event effects, I analyze only successful autocoups for three reasons:
The majority of autocoups succeed (87 out of 110 cases); failed autocoups tend to
produce immediate political shocks, rather than medium- or long-term effects;
failed autocoups are often followed by major disruptive events, such as coups,
insurrections, or mass protests, making it difficult to isolate their impact. For
example, in Niger's case, a failed autocoup in 2009 was followed by a coup in
2010, creating overlapping political effects. In contrast, successful autocoups
provide a clearer analytical framework, as their effects are less entangled with
other disruptions, allowing for a more systematic assessment of institutional
change.

#### Variables

This study uses a global sample of all country-year data from 1950 to 2020,
applying a linear model to examine the effects of autocoups on political change.
The dependent variable is the change in Polity scores, while the main independent
variable is autocoups. The dataset includes approximately 7,500 observations.

The dependent variable measures political change using three-year differences in
Polity scores. Model 1 (Pre-event effects): $Polity_t − Polity_{t − 3}$. Model 2
(Post-event effects): $Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t$.

The Polity score ranges from -10 (full autocracy) to 10 (full democracy). Some
values in the dataset, such as -66, -77, and -88, represent transitional regimes
or special periods. To prevent excessive data loss, I replace these values with
the closest valid Polity scores. This approach ensures that the model captures
all changes in Polity scores, rather than focusing solely on transitions that
cross a democratic threshold.

The main independent variable is autocoups, as introduced in Chapter 3. The
dataset includes110 attempted autocoups (used for pre-event analysis) and 87
successful autocoups (used for post-event analysis). For pre-event analysis, the
autocoup variable is binary, where: 1 indicates the presence of an attempted
autocoup and 0 indicates no autocoup event.

For post-event analysis, I apply decay functions to account for both immediate
and delayed effects, following the methodology of @dahl2023. To assess the
persistence of autocoup effects, I consider a half-life specification of five
years, analysing the impact from the autocoup year ($y_t$) to four years after
($y_{t+4}$).

I also include traditional coups as a secondary independent variable for two
reasons. Comparative significance: It is essential to compare the effects of
autocoups and coups. Overlapping events: In many cases, coups and autocoups are
interconnected, as autocoups can trigger coups. Distinguishing their effects is
necessary for a clear empirical analysis.

As in previous chapters, I use the coup dataset from @powell2011. To maintain
consistency, I apply the same methodological approach to coups as to autocoups:
Binary coding for pre-event effects and decay function coding for post-event
effects.

Control variables include economic performance, political stability, and
population size, all of which have been analysed in previous chapters.
Additionally, I incorporate two dummy variables. The first,
**"**non_democracy**,"** accounts for regime type, recognizing that
non-democratic regimes with Polity scores below -6 have limited room for further
decline, while democracies with scores above 6 are less likely to experience
significant increases. The second, **"**cold_war**,"** follows the approach used
in prior studies on the impact of coups on democratization [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023] and accounts for the Cold War period. This
variable captures the observable trend of declining Polity scores from the 1960s
to 1990, followed by an upward shift after 1990.

### Results and discussion

#### Pre-event effects

Initially, I analyse the trajectory of Polity scores leading up to these events.
As presented in @tbl-demomodel, columns 1 and 2 display the empirical results for
pre-event effects, examining changes over two years (model 1) and three years
(model 2) prior to the event. Consistent with the first hypothesis, Polity scores
exhibit a significant decline in the 2–3 years preceding an autocoup. Notably,
this downward trend is both more pronounced and statistically significant for
autocoups compared to traditional coups.

```

Column 1 examines the pre-event changes, specifically the difference between
Polity scores at time $t-1$ and $t-3$ ($Polity_{t-1} - Polity_{t-3}$). The
results reveal a statistically significant decrease in Polity scores prior to
autocoups. On average, Polity scores decline by 0.45 in the two years before an
autocoup, holding other factors constant. In contrast, no significant changes are
observed before traditional coups, indicating that pre-coup periods do not
measurably affect democratization levels.

Column 2 assesses the cumulative impact from three years prior to the event year,
calculated as $Polity_{t} - Polity_{t-3}$. As previously discussed, the year of
an autocoup or coup witnesses a substantial shock to political institutions.
Consequently, both types of events result in a decline in Polity scores relative
to three years earlier. However, the negative effect of autocoups is more severe.
Polity scores decline by an average of 1.53 in the three years leading up to an
autocoup, compared to 1.27 for coups, all else being equal. This disparity
reinforces our hypothesis that autocoups have a more detrimental pre-event effect
on democratic institutions as incumbents overextend their legitimate tenure.

#### Post-event effects

Columns 3 and 4 present the empirical results for post-event effects, analysing
changes in Polity scores following attempted (column 3) and successful (column 4)
autocoups.

Column 3 examines the impact of attempted autocoups. The results indicate that
attempted autocoups do not have a statistically significant effect on Polity
scores. This contrasts with coup attempts, which lead to an average increase of
0.48 in Polity scores over three years, all else being equal.

Column 4 evaluates the impact of successful autocoups. In contrast to attempted
autocoups, successful autocoups demonstrate a significant negative effect on
Polity scores, with an average decline of 0.33 over three years, holding other
factors constant. Conversely, successful coups continue to exhibit positive
effects on democratization, resulting in an average increase of 0.72.

These findings yield several key insights. First, while both successful and
attempted coups influence Polity scores, only successful autocoups produce
statistically significant effects—and exclusively in a negative direction.
Second, the impact of coups on democratization is more nuanced. Although
post-coup Polity scores may improve, the pre-coup period often involves
significant democratic backsliding. My models indicate that, on average, the
democratic gains following a coup fail to offset the losses incurred before it.

#### Effects of control variables

To ensure robust results, I incorporated several control variables into the
models. While economic trends and political violence do not exhibit statistically
significant effects on Polity scores, other factors warrant further discussion.

The impact of the Cold War is relatively straightforward. As outlined in the
research design section, global democracy experienced a general decline during
the Cold War period. Consistent with this trend, all four models indicate that
the Cold War era is associated with an average decrease of 0.23 in Polity scores.

The effects of GDP per capita, population size, and regime type, however, present
a more complex pattern. Counter-intuitively, higher GDP per capita correlates
with lower Polity scores, whereas non-democratic regimes and larger populations
correspond with positive changes in Polity scores. This pattern may be explained
by considering baseline differences between democracies and non-democracies. In
established democracies, Polity scores are already high, leaving limited room for
further increases. These countries also tend to have higher GDP per capita and
lower birth rates, further reinforcing stability in their democratic scores. In
contrast, non-democracies start from lower Polity scores, providing greater
potential for upward movement. Given that authoritarian regimes often exhibit
weaker economic performance and higher population growth rates, their Polity
scores may increase as they undergo political transitions or reforms.

Taken together, these results support both hypotheses. First, the primary effects
of autocoups on Polity scores manifest before the events occur. Second, whereas
coups have ambiguous consequences for democratization, the effects of autocoups
are unidirectional—consistently negative.

#### Robustness tests

To assess the sensitivity of my key findings to model specifications, I conduct a
series of robustness tests. The results indicate that the findings remain
consistent across these variations.

First, I compare the effects of autocoups over a period ranging from one to five
years after the event. The results show that the effects of coups are positive
and statistically significant throughout all five years, with a general trend of
increasing magnitude as time progresses. In contrast, the effects of autocoups
are negative across all five years but reach statistical significance only three
years after the event. This finding aligns with the earlier hypothesis: autocoups
never contribute to an increase in Polity scores.

Second, I refine the treatment of autocoups by replacing the decay effects of
autocoups with a dummy variable that distinguishes between attempted and
successful autocoups. Additionally, I disaggregate the ‘Non-democracy’ category
into specific regime types—democracy, dominant-party, military, monarchy, and
personal—consistent with the analysis of coup determinants, setting democracy as
the reference category.

Columns 1 and 2 in @tbl-demomodel2 examine the effects of attempted autocoups,
measured two and three years after the event, respectively, while Columns 3 and 4
focus on successful autocoups. As in previous models, these adjustments do not
alter the core findings across all four models. However, while they lead to
differences in regression coefficients, the results consistently show that Polity
scores decline following autocoups in all models, in contrast to the increase
observed after coups.

Comparing Columns 3 and 4 in @tbl-demomodel2 and @tbl-demomodel, it becomes
evident that replacing the decay factor for autocoups and coups with a dummy
variable significantly amplifies the estimated effects—nearly doubling them. This
result aligns with expectations, as the decay factor distributes the influence of
events over subsequent years, whereas the event dummy captures their impact
exclusively in the year of occurrence.

Furthermore, @tbl-demomodel2 reveals distinct regime-specific variations.
Military regimes exhibit the largest increase in Polity scores, followed by
monarchies and personalist regimes, with dominant-party regimes showing the
smallest but still statistically significant positive effect compared to
democracies. This finding corroborates the results in Chapter 2, which indicate
that military and personalist regimes are more prone to coups. The analysis in
this chapter proves that Polity scores increase significantly following coups.

### Summary

This chapter examines the impact of autocoups on political institutions,
particularly in contrast to coups, by analysing their effects on changes in
Polity scores. It tests two central hypotheses: first, that unlike coups, the
effects of autocoups on Polity scores manifest primarily before the event,
indicating that leaders consolidate power in anticipation of their autocoups; and
second, that while coups produce ambiguous effects—sometimes leading to
democratization and other times reinforcing authoritarianism, as suggested by
previous literature—autocoups consistently result in democratic backsliding or
authoritarian entrenchment.

To evaluate these hypotheses, the chapter employs multiple robustness checks,
including varying time horizons, alternative model specifications, and different
variable treatments. A key finding is that Polity scores begin to decline in the
years leading up to an autocoup, underscoring a pre-emptive process of
authorization. In contrast, coups initially cause a sharp drop in Polity scores
due to the shock of leadership change, but over time, scores often rise,
suggesting that in some cases, coups can contribute to an improvement in the
level of democracy. These findings highlight the fundamentally different
political trajectories triggered by coups and autocoups.

The implications of these results are significant for both academic research and
political practice. While coups have long been a focal point of democratization
studies, this chapter argues that autocoups demand equal, if not greater,
attention due to their systematic role in reversing democratic progress. Unlike
coups, which can sometimes serve as catalysts for political reform, autocoups
almost always reinforce authoritarianism, weakening institutions and eroding
democratic governance. This underscores the urgent need for scholars and
policy-makers to closely monitor the conditions that enable autocoups and their
broader consequences for democratic stability.

Methodologically, this chapter contributes to the study of political transitions
by demonstrating the importance of pre-event trends in analysing regime change.
It also highlights the necessity of distinguishing between different types of
irregular power transitions when assessing their long-term effects. While the
findings reinforce the study’s core arguments, they also raise questions for
future research—particularly regarding leader survival. As shown in Chapter 4,
autocoup leaders tend to survive in power for nearly 11 years on average, while
coup-installed leaders last only about 5 years. This suggests that coups and
autocoups not only differ in their immediate effects but also have distinct
long-term political consequences.

In conclusion, this chapter strengthens the argument that autocoups are a
critical yet under-explored mechanism of authoritarian survival, one that
warrants further investigation to fully understand its implications for global
democratization and authoritarian resilience.

## Conclusion

### Main findings

This study provides critical insights into the dynamics and implications of
irregular power transitions, with a specific focus on coups and autocoups. The
research illuminates the complex interplay between incumbents and challengers
vying for power, yielding three key findings.

-   **Coup attempt determinant**: The expected success rate significantly
    influences the likelihood of a coup attempt. This success rate is largely
    determined by the balance of power between incumbent leaders and challengers,
    which varies by regime type. Notably, the findings show that military regimes
    are approximately 277.7% more likely, and personalist regimes 94% more
    likely, to experience coups compared to dominant-party regimes, all else
    being equal.

-   **Autocoup concept and dataset**: I introduce a refined concept of
    "autocoup", defined as an incumbent leader's refusal to relinquish power as
    mandated. We present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events
    from 1945 to 2023, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups.
    Case studies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset's utility for
    quantitative research.

-   **Leader longevity**: Survival analysis techniques reveal clear differences
    in leader longevity between coup-installed leaders and autocoup leaders. The
    findings reveal that, on average, coup-installed leaders are 2.23 times more
    likely to be ousted from power than autocoup leaders, all else being equal.

### Policy implications

The examination of irregular power transitions and leadership survival offers a
crucial perspective on the interrelated phenomena of democratic backsliding,
breakdown, and autocratic intensification. The findings of this study provide
logical explanations for several political trends:

-   **Global democracy regression:** This study elucidates why global freedom has
    declined for the 18th consecutive year. Irregular power transitions, whether
    through coups or autocoups, inherently violate democratic norms and disrupt
    the trajectory toward stable democracies.

-   **Within-regime democratic erosion:** The research explains why democratic
    backsliding often occurs within regimes [@mechkova2017], rather than through
    regime change. Democracies are becoming less liberal and autocracies less
    competitive, particularly due to the prevalence of autocoups since 2000
    [@bermeo2016]. As discussed in Chapter 3, autocoups extend the tenure of
    incumbent leaders without overturning the regime itself.

-   **Rise of autocoups since 2000:** The analysis also clarifies why autocoups
    have been on the rise since 2000. Incumbent leaders possess several strategic
    advantages: firstly, they have a significantly higher probability of success
    due to their incumbent vantages compared to coup plotters. Secondly, the
    consequences of failed autocoups are relatively milder than those for failed
    coup plotters, resulting in lower costs even if they fail. Lastly, leaders
    who manage to extend their rule through an autocoup often enjoy considerably
    longer tenures compared to coup-installed leaders, thus benefiting more
    substantially.

-   **Role of external pressure:** Due to the challenges of internal opposition
    to autocoups, where power is concentrated in the hands of incumbent leaders,
    external pressure from regional or international communities may play a vital
    role in encouraging adherence to constitutional processes of power
    transition. For instance, after the general election in Venezuela on July 29,
    2024, at least nine Latin American countries rejected the election results
    and called for dialogue[^3]. Although this pressure might not be effective in
    every case, it showcases the potential influence of the international
    community in discouraging future autocoup attempts.

### Limitations and directions for future research

While the study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular leadership
transitions, several limitations require further exploration:

-   **Data refinement:** Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach.
    Future research should validate this classification system through additional
    studies and expert evaluations.

-   **Data harmonization:** The current analysis faces challenges due to
    mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup
    datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for
    more robust comparisons.

-   **Democratic backsliding:** While this study establishes a connection between
    irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical
    evidence is needed to solidify this link.

Future research avenues include:

-   **Terminology and data collection:** Refining the "autocoup" concept and
    achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive
    data collection.

-   **Dataset expansion:** Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and
    integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can
    provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.

-   **Power dynamics and long-term impacts:** Utilizing this dataset, future
    studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the
    long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems,
    particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization
    of power.

In conclusion, this study significantly contributes to our understanding of
irregular leadership transitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining
autocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader
longevity, I establish a robust framework for understanding irregular power
transitions and leadership survival. This work deepens our comprehension of
democratic resilience and political stability, providing a foundation for future
research to conduct further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup
dataset and continue refining the framework.
