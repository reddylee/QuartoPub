## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This thesis addresses a significant gap in the literature on irregular leadership
transitions by systematically integrating autocoups—cases where incumbent leaders
extend their constitutionally mandated terms through extra-constitutional means.
It refines the conceptual definition of autocoups, resolving existing ambiguities
to align them more closely with conventional coup frameworks. Based on this
refined definition, the thesis presents a novel global dataset of autocoup events
from 1945 to 2023, encompassing 83 documented cases, of which 64 were successful.

Employing this dataset, the study conducts a large-N empirical analysis to
investigate the structural determinants of autocoups. The findings reveal that
power-centric regimes, specifically presidential democracies and personalist
regimes, are significantly more prone to employing autocoups as a strategy for
power retention compared to other regime types. This pattern contrasts with
traditional coups, which have historically been more prevalent in military
regimes.

The analysis subsequently examines leadership survival, utilising survival
analysis techniques to evaluate the political longevity of leaders who assumed
office through regular means, traditional coups, or autocoups. Contrary to the
hypothesis that the mode of power acquisition significantly influences leadership
survival—particularly the expectation that autocoup leaders would enjoy longer
tenures than those installed through traditional coups—the results suggest that,
when excluding very short-lived tenures (i.e., less than 180 days), the mode of
accession does not exert a statistically significant effect on leadership
duration. Instead, regime type emerges as the primary determinant: leaders in
military and personalist regimes exhibit significantly higher hazard ratios for
removal compared to the reference category of dominant-party regimes, consistent
with trends observed following traditional coups.

The thesis further explores the broader institutional consequences of irregular
power transitions, focusing on their impact on democratisation. Using Polity
scores as a proxy for democratic quality and applying a country-fixed effects
model, the analysis finds that autocoups are associated with a sustained decline
in democratic indicators, both immediately after the event and over a two-year
period. In contrast, traditional coups exhibit a ‘U-shaped’ effect: although
Polity scores decline sharply in the immediate aftermath, they typically recover
to pre-coup levels within two years. These findings highlight the divergent
political trajectories triggered by coups and autocoups, underscoring the need
for increased scholarly and policy attention to the persistently detrimental
impact of autocoups on democratic governance.

Collectively, these findings illuminate the distinct nature, drivers, and
consequences of coups and autocoups. The research makes several substantive
contributions: it clarifies the conceptual boundaries of autocoups, provides a
new empirical foundation for their systematic study, and offers robust
comparative insights into how different modes of irregular power transition
affect leadership survival and institutional development. These findings have
significant implications for academic scholarship and policy-making, particularly
in the context of global democratic backsliding and the resilience of political
institutions.

## Introduction

Why are some political leaders removed from office prematurely, while others
successfully extend their tenure beyond constitutionally mandated limits?
Moreover, how does the mode of their survival or removal influence political
stability and democratic institutions? This thesis addresses these critical
questions by analysing the structural and strategic foundations of irregular
leadership transitions.

### Rationale

The stability and resilience of political systems hinge on the orderly transfer
of power. Leadership transitions that occur within established institutional
frameworks reinforce political legitimacy and enhance regime durability.
Conversely, the breakdown of conventional mechanisms for political succession
often precipitates instability, violence, and democratic backsliding. Among the
most disruptive of these breakdowns are irregular leadership transitions, which
leave enduring institutional legacies and fundamentally alter the political
trajectories of regimes. Understanding the causes and consequences of such events
is central to the study of political order and regime change.

The existing literature identifies a diverse array of catalysts for irregular
leadership exits, including civil wars [@kokkonen2019], international conflicts
[@demesquita1995], ethnic divisions [@londregan1995], economic crises
[@miller2012; @krishnarajan2019], and natural disasters [@quirozflores2012].
Among these, coups d’état are particularly significant due to their frequency and
direct displacement of incumbent leaders. In autocratic regimes, coups account
for nearly one-third of all leadership exits, surpassing regular transitions,
which constitute just over one-fifth [@frantz2016]. Furthermore, over $63\%$ of
non-constitutional removals in dictatorships are attributable to coups
[@svolik2009].

Consequently, coups have garnered extensive scholarly attention, with a
substantial body of research exploring their causes, outcomes, and long-term
implications for democracy and development [@thyne2019]. The study of coup
determinants has flourished, with scholars proposing nearly one hundred
explanatory variables, yet a widely accepted baseline model remains elusive
[@gassebner2016].

In contrast, autocoups—wherein incumbent leaders extend their constitutionally
mandated terms through extra-constitutional means—have received comparatively
limited academic scrutiny. Although autocoups do not immediately result in
leadership change, they represent a fundamental breach of institutional
succession norms and obstruct the anticipated regular transfer of power. As such,
they merit classification as a critical, yet understudied, form of irregular
leadership transition.

This thesis contends that autocoups warrant systematic analysis alongside
traditional coups within a unified analytical framework. Despite differences in
their execution, both coups and autocoups involve extra-constitutional efforts to
acquire or retain power and have profound implications for leadership survival,
regime stability, and democratic integrity. A comparative analysis of these two
forms of irregular transition can elucidate shared drivers, divergent outcomes,
and broader lessons for democratic resilience.

The urgency of this inquiry is underscored by the significant risks associated
with irregular transitions. Both coups and autocoups can trigger immediate
crises—ranging from institutional paralysis to civil unrest—and leave lasting
institutional scars. More fundamentally, they often dismantle constitutional
checks and balances, undermine electoral processes, and accelerate democratic
decline or authoritarian consolidation.

Historical cases vividly illustrate these dangers. Ghana’s turbulent period from
1979 to 1984 exemplifies the destabilising effects of classic coups. Following
Jerry Rawlings’s 1979 coup, eight individuals, including three former heads of
state, were executed [@pieterse1982]. Rawlings orchestrated another coup in 1981
and subsequently suppressed three further coup attempts [@haynes2022d]. By
contrast, the 1992 autocoup in Peru, led by President Alberto Fujimori,
demonstrates how an incumbent can dismantle democratic institutions without a
change in leadership. Fujimori dissolved Congress, suspended the constitution,
and ruled by decree [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998].

These patterns are increasingly pertinent in the contemporary global political
landscape. According to Freedom House’s Freedom in the World 2024 report, global
political rights and civil liberties declined for the eighteenth consecutive year
in 2023, with setbacks recorded in 52 countries and improvements in only 21
[@freedomhouse2024freedom]. The persistence of democratic erosion underscores the
pressing need to understand the mechanisms that facilitate it, including both
coups and autocoups.

This thesis aims to advance the theoretical and empirical understanding of
irregular leadership transitions. It offers insights with significant
implications for scholarly research and policy formulation, particularly in
fragile or democratising regimes.

### Research objectives and contributions

In response to the significant challenges posed by irregular leadership
transitions, this study undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis
structured around four core research objectives. Firstly, it aims to refine the
conceptual definition of autocoups and develop a novel dataset suitable for
large-N empirical analysis. Secondly, it seeks to identify the structural and
institutional determinants of autocoups through systematic quantitative
investigation. Thirdly, it compares the survival prospects of leaders who assume
power through traditional coups with those who extend their tenure via autocoups.
Finally, it evaluates the divergent impacts of coups and autocoups on
democratisation trajectories and the resilience of political institutions.

By examining both coups and autocoups from 1945 to 2023, this thesis addresses a
critical gap in political science by developing and applying a unified analytical
framework that treats these events as distinct yet interrelated forms of
extra-constitutional power transition. Through this approach, the study makes
four principal contributions to the literature on leadership dynamics, regime
stability, and institutional development.

**Conceptual clarification and empirical foundation for autocoups:** This thesis
enhances conceptual clarity by situating autocoups within the broader typology of
irregular power transitions. It provides a refined definition of autocoups,
focusing on the executive’s unilateral extension of tenure through
extra-constitutional means, and clearly distinguishes them from executive
aggrandisement and traditional military coups. Building on this conceptual
framework, the study introduces an original dataset of autocoup events from 1945
to 2023, documenting 83 incidents, of which 64 were successful. This dataset
addresses a long-standing empirical gap and establishes a robust foundation for
systematic comparative analysis, enabling future research into a previously
understudied form of institutional disruption.

**First empirical analysis of autocoup determinants**: Utilising the newly
compiled dataset, the thesis conducts the first empirical examination of the
structural and institutional conditions conducive to autocoups. The analysis
reveals that leaders in power-concentrated systems—particularly presidential
democracies and personalist regimes—are significantly more likely to extend their
tenure through autocoups compared to those in other regime types. These findings
contribute to the literature on the interplay between regime characteristics and
irregular power retention, highlighting the pivotal role of institutional
structures in shaping leaders’ strategic decisions to circumvent term limits.

**Comparative analysis of leadership longevity**: The research advances the study
of leadership survival by comparing the tenure durations of leaders who attain
power through regular means, traditional coups, or autocoups. Employing survival
analysis, the study finds that, contrary to expectations, the mode of power
acquisition does not significantly predict leadership longevity. However, it
reaffirms the decisive influence of regime type on leader survival, regardless of
the mode of accession or retention. The survival models indicate that leaders in
military and personalist regimes face higher hazard ratios for removal compared
to those in dominant-party regimes. These results underscore the critical
influence of regime structure on leadership durability and elite turnover.

**Comparative democratic implications of coups and autocoups**: The thesis
further investigates the differential impacts of coups and autocoups on
democratic development. Using country-fixed effects regression models and Polity
V scores as an indicator of democratic quality, the analysis demonstrates that
autocoups are associated with a gradual and sustained decline in Polity scores,
both immediately following the event and over a two-year period. In contrast,
coups result in a ‘U-shaped’ institutional outcome: while they precipitate
immediate declines in Polity scores, these typically recover to pre-event levels
within two years. This disaggregated analysis illuminates the distinct
trajectories and institutional consequences of different forms of irregular power
transitions.

Collectively, these contributions provide a robust theoretical and empirical
foundation for understanding the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions,
offering significant insights for both academic scholarship and policy
formulation in the context of democratic resilience and institutional stability.

### Policy implications

Although scholarly debate continues regarding the potential for coups to
inadvertently foster democratisation under specific circumstances [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016], a robust policy consensus holds that coups
represent inherently illegitimate mechanisms of political change. As violent
disruptions of constitutional order, they typically inflict immediate
institutional damage, precipitate instability, and result in unpredictable
political trajectories. Consequently, both international and domestic policy
responses have prioritised prevention, most notably through ‘coup-proofing’
strategies aimed at insulating regimes from military intervention or elite
defection [@quinlivan1999; @pilster2012; @powell; @albrecht2014; @carey2015;
@brown2015; @sudduth2017]. However, as this thesis demonstrates, such approaches
have well-documented limitations [@albrecht2014a; @reiter2020], and deeper
structural power dynamics within regimes are often more critical in determining
vulnerability to both coups and autocoups.

The findings of this study yield several important policy implications,
particularly in the domains of institutional design, international responses, and
the monitoring of democratic backsliding. In terms of institutional design, the
research highlights the heightened susceptibility of power-concentrated
systems—such as presidential democracies and personalist regimes—to autocoups.
This underscores the importance of reinforcing institutional checks and balances
through mechanisms such as independent judiciaries, robust legislative oversight,
and clearly defined constitutional term limits, all of which serve to constrain
executive overreach and mitigate the risk of extra-constitutional power
consolidation. With regard to international responses, the persistent democratic
erosion associated with autocoups—evidenced by sustained declines in Polity V
scores—calls for proactive diplomatic and economic interventions. These may
include targeted sanctions, conditional aid, or other measures aimed at deterring
incumbent leaders from circumventing constitutional constraints to prolong their
tenure. Moreover, the effective monitoring of democratic backsliding requires
more sophisticated frameworks capable of detecting early warning signs of
autocoups. These signs often manifest in gradual and legally veiled efforts to
undermine term-limit provisions or manipulate electoral processes, in contrast to
the more abrupt and overt power seizures typical of traditional coups. These
policy implications, which call for tailored approaches to address the distinct
dynamics of coups and autocoups, will be examined further in the concluding
chapter.

### Limitations and future research

Whilst this study proposes a novel analytical framework for understanding coups
and autocoups, their impact on leadership survival, and their broader
institutional consequences, several limitations persist, pointing to significant
opportunities for future research and refinement.

A primary challenge lies in the conceptual ambiguity surrounding the definition
of autocoups, particularly in borderline cases where incumbents extend their
authority through legal or quasi-legal mechanisms. Future research could explore
the normative and analytical trade-offs of including such cases within the
autocoup category. Comparative analyses of ‘unconstitutional’ versus
‘extra-constitutional’ extensions of executive tenure may help determine whether
these actions represent variants of the same phenomenon or distinct processes.
The case of President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras in 2009, whose attempt to amend
the constitution to permit future re-election precipitated his removal by a
military coup [@muñoz-portillo2019], exemplifies the analytical complexity of
identifying autocoups and underscores the need for refined coding criteria and
greater interpretive clarity in future data collection efforts.

Given the long-term decline in traditional coups and the concurrent rise of
autocoups, increased scholarly focus on the latter is essential. Although this
study centres on tenure extension as the defining characteristic of autocoups,
broader forms of executive power expansion—whether within or beyond formal
constitutional frameworks—warrant systematic investigation. The development of a
dedicated dataset on executive power expansion would be a critical step towards
capturing the full spectrum of such practices.

Furthermore, the decreasing frequency of overt and dramatic regime transitions
since the early 2000s, coupled with a reduction in clear shifts between democracy
and autocracy, highlights the need for more sensitive analytical tools to detect
incremental changes within regimes. Future empirical research should prioritise
the identification and measurement of these subtler transformations to better
understand their implications for regime stability and democratic resilience.

These limitations and promising avenues for future inquiry will be examined in
greater detail in the concluding chapter.

### Overview of the thesis

This thesis examines the intricate power dynamics underlying coups and autocoups,
focusing on their consequences for leadership survival and the democratisation or
authoritarian transformation of political regimes. It develops a unified
analytical framework to study these phenomena as distinct yet interconnected
forms of irregular power transition. Each chapter contributes to this overarching
inquiry by providing conceptual clarifications, empirical innovations, and
comparative insights.

#### Chapter 2: Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Dataset Introduction {.unnumbered}

Despite the rising prevalence of autocoups, particularly in the post-Cold War
era, their systematic study remains underdeveloped. The existing literature
suffers from conceptual fragmentation, marked by a proliferation of overlapping
and inconsistently defined terms (e.g., ‘self-coup’, ‘autogolpe’, ‘executive
aggrandisement’) [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This conceptual ambiguity
hinders empirical analysis, as many datasets fail to distinguish between tenure
extension and other forms of executive power consolidation—a critical distinction
for this study. Consequently, methodological progress has been limited, with most
research relying on qualitative case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021;
@pion-berlin2022] rather than large-N analyses.

This chapter addresses these shortcomings by proposing a precise and
theoretically grounded definition of the autocoup, centred on attempts by
incumbents to extend their constitutionally mandated terms of office through
extra-constitutional means. By focusing on tenure extension, the definition
excludes broader forms of executive aggrandisement that occur within existing
constitutional timeframes, aligning autocoups conceptually with traditional
coups, both of which disrupt constitutionally prescribed leadership succession.
Building on this definition, the chapter introduces a significant empirical
contribution: an original global dataset of autocoups from 1945 to 2023,
documenting 83 distinct events, of which 64 were successful. This dataset enables
systematic quantitative analysis and opens new avenues for comparative research
on irregular power retention.

#### Chapter 3: Power Dynamics and Autocoup Attempts {.unnumbered}

Due to long-standing conceptual and empirical constraints, prior discussions of
autocoups have predominantly relied on case-based approaches [@baturo;
@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. The dataset introduced in Chapter 2
facilitates, for the first time, a large-N analysis of the structural conditions
underpinning autocoup attempts.

Drawing on insights from the coup literature, this chapter examines a range of
potential predictors, including economic performance, succession rules, military
influence, protest activity, and media freedom. While these variables have been
explored in the context of traditional coups, they often fail to account for
persistent cross-regime variation or the limited efficacy of ‘coup-proofing’
strategies [@albrecht2014a; @reiter2020]. Moreover, many studies employ overly
simplistic regime typologies (e.g., democracy versus autocracy, or civilian
versus military), obscuring significant variation within regime types
[@hiroi2013; @schiel2019].

This chapter argues that the risk of autocoups is fundamentally shaped by the
structural balance of power established at a regime’s inception. Specifically,
the likelihood of an autocoup is determined by the equilibrium between incumbents
and potential institutional challengers [@geddes2014]. Using regime typologies as
proxies for internal power structures, the analysis employs both a standard logit
model and a bias-reduced logit model (Firth’s penalised maximum likelihood
estimation). The results demonstrate that presidential democracies and
personalist regimes are significantly more prone to autocoup attempts than
dominant-party regimes, when controlling for other variables. By contrast,
leaders in dominant-party and military regimes exhibit no significant difference
in their likelihood of attempting an autocoup. These findings highlight the
critical role of regime type in shaping elite incentives for irregular tenure
extension.

#### Chapter 4: Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival {.unnumbered}

Although extensive research has examined the tenure survival of leaders who
assume power through coups [@gandhi2007; @sudduth2017; @easton2018], the lack of
comparable data on autocoups has precluded systematic comparisons among
regular-entry leaders, coup-installed leaders, and autocoup leaders. This chapter
addresses this gap by conducting the first comparative survival analysis of these
three categories within a unified theoretical framework.

It posits that coup-installed leaders typically face heightened legitimacy
deficits, political uncertainty, and institutional instability, whereas autocoup
leaders benefit from institutional continuity while dismantling key constraints.
These differing conditions shape distinct pathways to political consolidation.
Surprisingly, the time-dependent Cox model reveals no statistically significant
difference in survival risk among regular-entry, coup-installed, and autocoup
leaders once relevant covariates—particularly regime type—are accounted for.
Instead, regime characteristics exert a decisive influence on leadership tenure:
leaders in military and personalist regimes face significantly higher risks of
removal compared to those in dominant-party regimes.

#### Chapter 5: Coups, autocoups, and democracy {.unnumbered}

While the impact of coups on democratisation has been widely studied
[@clayton2000; @powell2014a; @thyne2020], the consequences of autocoups remain
underexplored due to the historical absence of relevant data. This chapter
addresses this gap through a quantitative analysis of how coups and autocoups
affect democratic institutions.

Whereas coups often result in leadership turnover or regime change, autocoups
typically involve incumbents dismantling institutional constraints without
altering the core ruling coalition. Consequently, their effects are best assessed
through continuous measures of democratic quality, such as Polity V scores,
rather than binary regime-type transitions. The chapter argues that autocoups
lead to consistent declines in Polity scores, while coups produce more complex
impacts. Empirical analysis using a country-fixed effects model confirms that
autocoups are associated with sustained reductions in Polity scores both
immediately following the event and over a two-year period. In contrast, coups
cause an initial decline in Polity scores but often exhibit a ‘U-shaped’ recovery
within two years. These findings underscore the uniquely insidious nature of
autocoups, which frequently proceed incrementally under a legalistic façade.

#### Chapter 6: Conclusion and future research directions {.unnumbered}

The concluding chapter synthesises the findings of the preceding chapters,
highlighting the structural, strategic, and institutional dynamics that underpin
irregular leadership transitions. It argues that coups and autocoups are not
merely disruptive events but strategic tools employed by elites to recalibrate or
entrench political authority. Their institutional legacies diverge: while coups
often destabilise regimes, autocoups typically consolidate autocratic rule.

This chapter outlines the broader implications of these findings for
understanding the resilience of autocracy, the vulnerability of democratic
institutions, and the strategic calculus of political leaders. It also proposes
several directions for future research, including further exploration of the
nuances of executive power expansion and the development of more sensitive
measures to detect incremental regime changes.

## Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Dataset Introduction {#sec-chapter3}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter proposes a refined conceptualisation of autocoups, defined as
instances where incumbent leaders extend their constitutionally mandated tenure
through extra-constitutional means, typically by circumventing or breaching term
limits. By critically reviewing and synthesising overlapping terms—such as
‘self-coup’, ‘autogolpe’, and ‘executive takeover’—the chapter delineates the
conceptual boundaries of the phenomenon, establishing tenure extension as its
defining feature. In distinguishing autocoups from broader and more ambiguous
forms of executive aggrandisement, it advances a more analytically precise
framework for examining irregular power extensions. Building on this conceptual
foundation, the chapter introduces an original global dataset of autocoup events
from 1945 to 2023, documenting 83 distinct cases, of which 64 were successful.
This empirical contribution facilitates systematic, large-N analysis of an
increasingly prevalent mode of authoritarian consolidation.

### Introduction

The stability and resilience of political systems depend fundamentally on the
orderly transfer of power. When leadership succession occurs within established
constitutional frameworks, it bolsters the legitimacy and durability of governing
institutions. Conversely, the breakdown of these norms often precipitates
political violence, institutional erosion, and prolonged instability

While many leadership transitions proceed without disruption, a significant
proportion do not. Authoritarian regimes and fragile democracies, in particular,
frequently experience two primary forms of irregular leadership outcomes: the
premature removal of incumbents and the extension of power beyond constitutional
limits.

The former—forced removals of leaders before the completion of their terms—has
been extensively studied within the broader category of irregular leadership
transitions. These events have profound implications for regime stability,
democratic legitimacy, and institutional development, making their causes and
consequences a central concern in political science.

The existing literature identifies a range of precipitating factors, including
civil wars [@kokkonen2019], international conflicts [@demesquita1995], ethnic
cleavages [@londregan1995], economic crises [@miller2012; @krishnarajan2019], and
natural disasters [@quirozflores2012]. Among these, coups d’état—defined as
illegal and overt attempts by military or state elites to depose a sitting
executive [@powell2011]—are the most frequent and consequential source of
leadership change. In autocratic contexts, coups account for approximately
one-third of all leader exits, surpassing regular transitions [@frantz2016], with
roughly two-thirds of non-constitutional removals in dictatorships attributable
to coups [@svolik2009]. Consequently, coups have attracted significant scholarly
attention, with researchers exploring their structural determinants, proximate
triggers, aftermath, and impacts on democratic consolidation and economic
development [@thyne2019].

However, this focus on traditional coups risks overshadowing a distinct and
increasingly prevalent form of irregular transition: the autocoup. In this
chapter, an autocoup is defined the extension of an incumbent leader’s tenure in
office beyond the originally mandated limit, achieved through
extra-constitutional means. Despite their growing incidence, particularly since
the end of the Cold War, autocoups remain under-theorised and under-examined.
Conceptual fragmentation, marked by a proliferation of overlapping and
inconsistently applied terms such as ‘self-coup’, ‘autogolpe’, and ‘executive
aggrandisement’ [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022], has impeded progress. This
lack of definitional clarity complicates data collection and comparative
analysis, as existing datasets often conflate tenure extensions with broader
forms of executive power consolidation, failing to isolate the specific
mechanisms this study seeks to examine [@baturo2022]. As a result, scholarship
has largely relied on qualitative case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021;
@pion-berlin2022], limiting opportunities for broader generalisation.

This chapter argues that these conceptual and empirical limitations obscure a
critical dimension of contemporary politics. It proposes a unified analytical
framework for examining coups and autocoups as distinct yet comparable strategies
for undermining constitutional norms of leadership succession. This comparative
approach is justified on three grounds.

Firstly, both coups and autocoups represent fundamental breaches of
constitutional order, with significant implications for democratic resilience,
political legitimacy, and institutional integrity. Analysing them together
enables a systematic examination of how different forms of irregular power
transition shape political development and democratisation trajectories.

Secondly, while both disrupt established succession norms, they operate in
opposing directions relative to the incumbent: coups prematurely terminate
leadership, whereas autocoups extend it beyond constitutional limits. This
contrast provides a valuable lens for exploring the mechanisms of political
survival and authoritarian consolidation.

Thirdly, a comparative framework illuminates pressing contemporary questions,
such as how the marked decline in coup frequency since the 1990s [@bermeo2016]
can be reconciled with the sustained erosion of democratic governance, now in its
eighteenth consecutive year [@freedomhouse2024freedom]. By incorporating
autocoups into the analytical framework, this study highlights the growing
significance of incremental, procedural subversions of democracy, often
orchestrated within existing legal and institutional structures.

To address these gaps, the chapter makes two primary contributions. Firstly, it
provides conceptual clarification by redefining autocoups as a subtype of
irregular leadership transition, centred specifically on extra-constitutional
tenure extension. This refined definition distinguishes autocoups from broader,
more diffuse forms of executive aggrandisement. Secondly, it introduces an
original global dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2023, compiled in
accordance with this re-conceptualised framework, enabling the first systematic
large-N analysis of the phenomenon.

The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews existing
definitions related to power extension and executive aggrandisement, culminating
in a revised conceptualisation of autocoups. Section 3 introduces the new
dataset, detailing its scope, coding criteria, and methodological foundations.
Section 4 presents an initial analysis through descriptive statistics and
illustrative case studies. The conclusion synthesises the chapter’s key
contributions and outlines directions for future research.

### literature review and clarification of definitions

A significant limitation in the study of irregular leadership transitions is the
insufficient integration of research on conventional coups and autocoups.
Although both represent critical mechanisms of extra-constitutional power
transfer, they have typically been examined in isolation, with limited attention
to their conceptual and empirical intersections.

This disjunction stems primarily from two factors: the historical
under-recognition of autocoups as a distinct subtype of irregular transition and
the persistent conceptual ambiguity surrounding their definition. While
conventional coups are generally characterised by the abrupt removal of
incumbents, autocoups involve incumbent-led efforts to retain or extend power by
circumventing constitutional constraints. However, the inconsistent use of
overlapping terms—such as ‘self-coup’, ‘autogolpe’, and ‘executive
aggrandisement’—has obscured these distinctions.

Clarifying the definition of autocoups is thus essential for constructing a
comparative framework capable of encompassing the full spectrum of irregular
power transitions. This section undertakes this task by distinguishing autocoups
from broader forms of executive power consolidation and conceptually aligning
them with traditional coups through their shared violation of constitutional
norms.

#### Terminology {.unnumbered}

The academic literature concerning autocoups utilises a diverse array of terms to
describe the extension of power or tenure by incumbent leaders. The most
prevalent is ‘self-coup’, or its Spanish equivalent ‘autogolpe’ [@przeworski2000;
@cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017; @marsteintredet2019]. This term gained
prominence following the actions of Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori in 1992,
which involved dissolving Congress, suspending the constitution, and ruling by
decree [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 observes,
‘self-coup’ is potentially misleading, as it implies the leader is acting against
themselves, whereas such actions typically target other state institutions or
constitutional constraints.

A second category of terminology encompasses terms such as ‘presidential coup’,
‘executive coup’, ‘constitutional coup’, ‘electoral coup’, ‘judicial coup’,
‘slow-motion coup’, ‘soft coup’, and ‘parliamentary coup’ [@marsteintredet2019].
Whilst these descriptors may highlight specific mechanisms or contexts, their
proliferation often engenders conceptual confusion. Many focus on the method of
power acquisition but neglect to consistently identify the perpetrator. Moreover,
such mechanisms—judicial rulings, legislative manoeuvres, or administrative
decrees—may be employed either by or against executive actors, thereby further
complicating classification.

A third group of terms includes phrases such as ‘incumbent takeover’, ‘executive
takeover’, and ‘overstay’. For instance, ‘incumbent takeover’ refers to “an event
perpetuated by a ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or
informal constraints on his/her power” [@baturo2022, p. 374], building upon
@svolik2014. Similarly, ‘overstay’ denotes “staying longer than the maximum term
as it stood when the candidate originally came into office”
[@ginsburg2011evasion, p. 1844]. These terms clarify the actor (the incumbent)
and the action (power consolidation or term extension) but frequently fail to
convey the illegality or unconstitutionality of such actions. Unlike ‘coup’,
which inherently implies an unlawful seizure of power, labels like ‘takeover’ or
‘overstay’ may inadvertently diminish the normative severity of these events.

Given that many extant terms prioritise procedural mechanisms over normative
considerations, or conflate legal and extra-legal practices, this study proposes
‘autocoup’ as the most precise and analytically coherent term. This term offers
several key advantages:

**Definitional clarity and focus on core Essence:** ‘Autocoup’ precisely denotes
an incumbent leader’s extension of their political tenure through
extra-constitutional means. This definition clearly distinguishes it from
conventional coups, typically initiated by external actors such as the military,
and from broader, more diffuse instances of executive aggrandisement.

**Emphasis on severity and normative implications**: The suffix ‘-coup’
underscores the significant breach of constitutional order inherent in such
actions. In both academic and policy contexts, the disruption and impact of
autocoups are often comparable to, or may exceed, those of conventional coups,
thus lending the term appropriate normative and critical weight.

**Accurate identification of the perpetrator:** The prefix ‘auto-’ explicitly
identifies the incumbent leader as the instigator, in contrast to conventional
coups, which are typically orchestrated by external actors, such as the military
or opposition factions, thereby ensuring precise attribution.

**Promotion of conceptual coherence and comparative analysis**: Sharing an
etymological root with ‘coup’, ‘autocoup’ maintains an intrinsic conceptual link,
ensuring logical consistency. This facilitates systematic comparative analysis of
distinct yet related forms of irregular leadership transition within a unified
analytical framework.

In summary, ‘autocoup’ precisely identifies both the actor and the act, clearly
conveys the illegitimacy and gravity of the behaviour, and establishes its
theoretical connections to conventional coups. It thus serves as the most
accurate and analytically robust term for capturing and analysing this
phenomenon, aligning seamlessly with the unified analytical framework this study
seeks to establish.

#### Definition {#sec-definition .unnumbered}

Whilst precise terminology is crucial, a significant challenge in defining
autocoups resides in identifying their primary characteristic: is it the
expansion of power, the extension of tenure, or both? This ambiguity stems from
the varied and often overlapping definitions prevalent within political science
literature.

The concepts of power expansion and tenure extension are frequently conflated or
employed interchangeably, leading to conceptual confusion. To enhance clarity, it
is essential to distinguish these phenomena rigorously. Power expansion pertains
to an incumbent accruing authority beyond their original constitutional remit,
typically through centralisation, the weakening of institutional checks and
balances, or encroachment upon other branches of the state, such as the
legislature or judiciary. Tenure extension, by contrast, involves efforts by a
leader to remain in office beyond the originally prescribed term, often through
constitutional amendments, manipulation of elections, or other mechanisms
designed to bypass term limits.

Many existing definitions of autocoups conflate these dynamics or overemphasise
power expansion. For instance, @cameron1998a defines a self-coup as “a temporary
suspension of the constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who
rules by decree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to
ratify a political system with broader executive power” (p. 220). Yet the concept
of “broader executive power” is inherently vague and open to contestation.
Similarly, the term incumbent takeover, defined as “an event perpetuated by a
ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or informal
constraints on his/her power” [@baturo2022, p. 374], builds upon earlier work by
@svolik2014 and likewise centres on power expansion. However, the dataset
employing this definition encompasses both power expansion and tenure extension.
Conversely, the term overstay is clearly defined as “staying longer than the
maximum term as it stood when the candidate originally came into office”
[@ginsburg2011evasion, p. 1844], thereby focusing specifically on tenure
extension.

This thesis contends that tenure extension should be regarded as the primary and
defining characteristic of an autocoup, for several reasons. Firstly, this focus
aligns autocoups conceptually with traditional coups. A classic coup is typically
characterised by the forcible and premature removal of a sitting executive; it
does not necessarily entail a reduction in the leader’s powers, but rather a
disruption of their tenure. By the same logic, an autocoup should be defined by
the prolongation of tenure, not solely by the expansion of executive authority.
An incumbent may experience a diminution of power whilst remaining in office—such
an instance would not be coded as a coup. Similarly, a leader who consolidates
authority without exceeding term limits would fall under the category of
executive aggrandisement, but not that of an autocoup.

Secondly, in practice, power expansion often functions as a strategic means to
facilitate tenure extension. The widely cited case of President Alberto Fujimori
in Peru exemplifies this dynamic. Although his 1992 actions involved the
suspension of the constitution and the dissolution of Congress, the ultimate
objective was to ensure his continued rule. The 1993 Constitution permitted him
to seek a second term, which he won in 1995. Subsequently, a law of “authentic
interpretation” passed by his congressional allies enabled him to run again in
2000—a move steeped in controversy. Although he secured re-election, his regime
collapsed in 2000 amidst corruption and human rights scandals, prompting his
flight to Japan [@ezrow2019]. In this light, it is illogical for incumbents to
consolidate power unless they intend to remain in office beyond their allotted
term; such actions merely strengthen their successors, whose interests may
diverge from their own.

Thirdly, the measurement of power expansion presents greater methodological
challenges than the identification of tenure extension. For example,
@cameron1998a defines a self-coup as involving both constitutional suspension and
congressional dissolution. Yet it remains unclear whether either act alone
constitutes an autocoup, whether both are required, or whether they should be
treated as distinct events. Whilst the complexity of measurement should not
preclude the consideration of power expansion, a clear point of departure is
required. This study therefore designates tenure extension as the definitional
core of autocoups, leaving the broader discussion of power expansion (and its
inverse, power contraction) to future research.

Based on these considerations, this study defines an autocoup as ***the extension
of an incumbent leader’s tenure in office beyond the originally mandated limit,
achieved through extra-constitutional means*****.**

This definition places tenure extension at the centre of the concept, whilst
acknowledging that power expansion may coexist. Firstly, the term incumbent
leader refers to the de facto national leader, irrespective of their formal
title. For instance, although Vladimir Putin formally stepped down as President
of Russia in 2008 and assumed the premiership, effective political power remained
in his hands. During this period, the presidency—held by Dmitry
Medvedev—functioned largely as a symbolic office under Putin’s continued control
[@chaisty2019]. To ensure consistency and minimise arbitrariness, this study
employs the Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] to determine whether an incumbent has
effectively remained in power.

Secondly, although tenure extension is the definitional cornerstone, this
framework does not exclude simultaneous power expansion. Both may occur in
tandem, but the decisive criterion remains the act of exceeding one’s original
time in office. In the Fujimori case, for example, the 1992 actions were not
coded as an autocoup until the adoption of the 1993 constitutional amendment
enabling his re-election.

Thirdly, autocoups may be executed through both legal and illegal means. For
instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye postponed general elections until
1969 after coming to power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan President José Eduardo dos
Santos suspended elections during much of his nearly four-decade rule [@baturo].
These represent clear violations of constitutional norms. Other instances—such as
Putin’s 2008 manoeuvre—may not be overtly illegal but nonetheless undermine the
constitutional spirit intended to limit consecutive terms. Consequently, this
definition emphasises the functional illegitimacy of such actions, regardless of
their formal legality, particularly where the incumbent is the direct and
principal beneficiary.

Finally, an incumbent who seeks re-election in accordance with the existing
constitution is not engaging in an autocoup. However, should they subsequently
refuse to concede defeat and remain in power beyond their lawful mandate, such
conduct would indeed constitute an autocoup.

By clarifying these definitional boundaries, this chapter establishes the
conceptual foundation for the autocoup dataset introduced in the subsequent
section.

### Introduction to the autocoup dataset

#### Defining the scope {.unnumbered}

Classifying political events as autocoups often necessitates addressing ambiguous
or borderline cases. To ensure consistency and minimise interpretive uncertainty,
this study adopts a coding strategy grounded in the definition articulated in the
preceding section. Specifically, only those instances in which incumbent leaders
extend their originally mandated term in office are coded as autocoups. Cases
involving power consolidation in the absence of tenure extension are excluded
from the dataset.

The temporal scope of the dataset spans the period from 1945 to the end of 2023,
reflecting the most recent data available at the time of compilation. The
geographical scope is global, encompassing leaders from all countries and
regions.

#### Classifying autocoups {.unnumbered}

In categorising autocoups, this study prioritises the methods employed by
incumbents, while outcomes constitute a secondary classificatory dimension.
Additional features are recorded where relevant information is available.

##### Evasion of term limits {.unnumbered}

One of the most prevalent tactics in autocoups is the evasion of term limits.
Incumbents deploy ostensibly legal mechanisms to prolong their hold on power,
primarily through the manipulation of constitutional provisions. Such manoeuvres
may include pressuring legislatures or courts to reinterpret term limits,
amending the constitution to allow extended terms, or replacing the constitution
entirely. In some instances, referendums are employed to confer a veneer of
democratic legitimacy. These extensions may range from the addition of a single
term to indefinite tenure.

**Changing the length of a term:** Incumbents may increase the duration of a
single term (e.g., from four to six years) without altering the number of terms
permitted. Examples include President David Dacko (Central African Republic,
1962), President Grégoire Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and President Augusto
Pinochet (Chile, 1988).

**Enabling re-election:** This involves modifying constitutional or legal
frameworks to permit re-election where it was previously barred. For instance,
President Carlos Menem of Argentina amended the constitution in 1993 to allow
himself to seek re-election, thereby extending his tenure.

**Abolishing term limits:** President Paul Biya of Cameroon successfully removed
presidential term limits in 2008, thereby enabling indefinite re-election.

**Declaring leadership for life:** This approach retains the semblance of
electoral competition, albeit often through manipulated or uncontested elections.
President Sukarno of Indonesia attempted to declare himself president for life in
1963, although this effort ultimately failed.

These strategies are frequently deployed in combination. For example, President
François Duvalier of Haiti first amended the constitution in 1961 to permit
immediate re-election and subsequently declared himself president for life in
1964.

##### Electoral manipulation and rigging {.unnumbered}

The second most frequently observed strategy in autocoups involves the
manipulation of electoral processes to ensure the incumbent remains in office.

**Delaying or cancelling elections:** The postponement of scheduled elections
without legitimate justification is a recurrent tactic. President François
Tombalbaye of Chad delayed general elections until 1969, having come to power in
1960. Similarly, President José Eduardo dos Santos of Angola suspended elections
throughout his tenure from 1979 to 2017.

**Rejecting unfavourable electoral outcomes:** Incumbents may refuse to concede
defeat and attempt to remain in office by unconstitutional means. A prominent
example is President Donald Trump of the United States, who declined to accept
the results of the 2020 presidential election and sought to overturn them.

**Electoral rigging:** Securing implausibly high vote shares is a key indicator
of electoral manipulation. This study codes elections in which incumbents receive
over $90\%$ of the vote as indicative of an autocoup. President Teodoro Obiang of
Equatorial Guinea has consistently achieved over $95\%$ in multiparty elections
since 1996.

**Exclusion of opposition:** Preventing opposition parties or candidates from
contesting elections—thereby converting them into de facto uncontested
contests—is considered a clear indicator of an autocoup.

##### Installation of a figurehead {.unnumbered}

Some incumbents seek to circumvent term limits by installing a trusted proxy or
figurehead, thereby retaining de facto control over state affairs while
relinquishing formal office.

A paradigmatic example is the 2008 presidential transition in Russia. Confronted
with constitutional term limits, President Vladimir Putin endorsed Dmitry
Medvedev as his successor, who was duly elected. Medvedev then appointed Putin as
Prime Minister. Despite the formal shift in roles, most analysts agree that Putin
retained substantial influence, effectively rendering Medvedev a figurehead.

It is important that the identification of such cases be grounded in objective
criteria to avoid arbitrary classification. Accordingly, this study relies on the
Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] to determine leadership status. If a former
officeholder is not recorded in Archigos as the country’s leader—despite wielding
informal power—they are not coded as engaging in a figurehead-style autocoup
within this dataset.

##### Reassignment of supreme authority {.unnumbered}

This strategy entails restructuring the constitutional or legal framework to
create a new, more powerful office, which the incumbent subsequently assumes
after formally leaving their original post.

In 2017, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan orchestrated a
constitutional referendum that transformed Turkey from a parliamentary to a
presidential system. The newly empowered presidency carried significantly
enhanced executive authority. Erdoğan then ran for, and won, the redefined
presidency, thereby maintaining control under a revised institutional
arrangement.

##### One-time extension arrangements {.unnumbered}

In certain cases, bespoke arrangements are enacted to extend an incumbent’s
tenure without altering the broader constitutional framework. These arrangements
are explicitly tailored to the current officeholder, with institutional rules on
tenure or term limits intended to resume their standard application for future
leaders. For example, in 2004, Lebanon extended President Émile Lahoud’s term by
three years through a one-off legal provision applying solely to his incumbency.

#### Data coding {.unnumbered}

The autocoup dataset is constructed on the basis of established datasets and
scholarly literature, thereby ensuring both reliability and comprehensiveness.
The principal sources employed for coding are listed in Table @tbl-source.

The Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political Leaders’ Affiliation
Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded] offer detailed records of national leaders
from 1875 to 2023. Although the temporal focus of this study is limited to events
occurring from 1945 onwards, these datasets are essential for identifying de
facto leaders and distinguishing them from nominal heads of state.

The Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022], which synthesises information from
eleven separate sources, provides a broad inventory of cases wherein executive
actors significantly curtailed institutional constraints on their authority. As
this dataset encompasses both power consolidation and tenure extension cases,
cross-referencing with Archigos [@goemans2009] and PLAD [@bomprezzi2024wedded]
was necessary to determine whether individual cases satisfied the definitional
criteria for an autocoup.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-source
#| tbl-cap: Main Data Sources for Coding the Autocoup Dataset

Autocoup <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reddylee/Datasets/main/autocoup_clean.csv")
# nrow(Autocoup)

# nrow(Autocoup)
# nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))
# nrow(Autocoup) - nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))
```

In total, 83 events were identified and coded as autocoups. Of these, 50
correspond to entries within the Incumbent Takeover dataset, while the remaining
33 were newly identified and coded by the author through cross-verification with
supplementary materials, including Archigos [@goemans2009], PLAD
[@bomprezzi2024wedded], and contemporary news sources.

Although a majority of cases originate from the Incumbent Takeover dataset, the
present study does not constitute a replication of that work. Of the 279 cases
catalogued in Incumbent Takeover, 229 were excluded from the current analysis on
the grounds that they entailed power consolidation without any accompanying
attempt to extend the leader’s tenure. Such instances lie beyond the definitional
scope of autocoups as operationalised in this thesis. This conceptual refinement
constitutes the principal point of departure from the Incumbent Takeover
framework.

The final dataset comprises 14 structured variables, in addition to a free-text
field for supplementary notes. The variables are as follows:

-   **Country identification:** Country code (ccode) and country name (country),
    following the standards of the Correlates of War project [@stinnett2002].

-   **Leader information:** Name of the de facto leader (leader_name), coded in
    accordance with the conventions employed in the Archigos [@goemans2009] and
    PLAD [@bomprezzi2024wedded] datasets.

-   **Timeline variables:** Date the leader assumed office (entry_date), date of
    departure (exit_date), date of the autocoup-defining event (autocoup_date),
    and commencement date of the extended term (extending_date).

-   **Power transition methods:** Mode of accession (entry_method), mode of
    departure (exit_method), and binary indicators for regular or irregular entry
    (entry_regular) and exit (exit_regular).

-   **Autocoup characteristics:** Method of tenure extension (autocoup_method)
    and outcome of the attempt (autocoup_outcome), categorised as: "failed and
    removed from office", "failed but completed original tenure", or
    "successful". For successful cases, the duration of the additional term is
    calculated as the interval between extending_date and exit_date.

-   **Data source:** The principal dataset from which the case was coded
    (source).

-   **Additional notes:** Contextual commentary on exceptional or borderline
    cases (notes).

Several coding challenges and methodological decisions warrant further
elaboration. In instances where tenure extensions occurred incrementally, the
`autocoup_date` corresponds to a pivotal event—such as the passage of a
constitutional amendment, a legislative vote, or the outcome of a referendum.
Where leaders attempted multiple autocoups, details are consolidated in the notes
field. Particular care was taken to distinguish between mere power consolidation
and explicit efforts to prolong tenure, which necessitated triangulation across
multiple sources. Furthermore, assessing the success or failure of an
autocoup—particularly in under-reported contexts—frequently required extensive
background research and qualitative judgment.

#### Data descriptions {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| label: data_descriptions

```

The primary coding process identified 83 instances of autocoups between 1945 and
2023, spanning 63 countries. This comprehensive dataset provides a robust
empirical foundation for analysing trends and patterns in autocoup attempts
across a wide array of political and institutional contexts.

A breakdown of the methods employed by incumbents to extend their tenure is
presented in @tbl-autocoup_method. The most prevalent strategy is the
legalisation or reintroduction of re-election, accounting for 37 cases. This is
followed by the removal of term limits (10 cases) and the declaration of the
leader as president for life (7 cases). Other tactics, such as the cancellation
of scheduled elections or the refusal to concede electoral defeat, appear less
frequently. Electoral rigging is recorded in only one case—primarily because it
is often difficult to verify with certainty, despite strong indications in many
instances.

Autocoups exhibit a notably high overall success rate of $77\%$, in stark
contrast to the approximate $50\%$ success rate observed in classical military
coups. Several factors may explain this discrepancy. First, incumbents possess
direct access to state resources and institutional mechanisms, which can be
deployed strategically to their advantage. Second, in contrast to the abrupt and
confrontational nature of traditional coups, autocoups tend to unfold gradually
and deliberately, affording incumbents time to consolidate elite support and
cultivate public legitimacy. Third, many autocoup strategies are implemented
under the guise of legality—via constitutional amendments or judicial
rulings—which reduces overt resistance and complicates efforts to mobilise
effective opposition. Finally, incumbents typically exercise considerable
influence over key state institutions, including the judiciary, legislature, and
security services, which facilitates the planning and consolidation of such
actions.

However, success rates differ markedly depending on the method employed. Certain
strategies appear to be consistently effective. For example, removing term
limits, cancelling elections, declaring oneself leader for life, delaying
elections, and installing figurehead successors all exhibit a $100\%$ success
rate within the dataset. Notably, these approaches represent some of the most
flagrant violations of constitutional norms concerning executive succession. This
pattern suggests that outcomes are shaped less by the degree of legal or
constitutional transgression than by the underlying distribution of political
power. In other words, the success of an autocoup is determined not by the
legality of the act, but by the incumbent’s capacity to control coercive,
judicial, and legislative institutions. Leaders who command overwhelming
authority are both willing and able to disregard constitutional constraints
precisely because their dominance insulates them from meaningful resistance.

By contrast, refusal to accept electoral defeat exhibits the lowest success rate,
with only one of four such attempts proving successful. Although the sample is
limited, this pattern may reflect the greater institutional resilience of
electoral democracies, stronger civil society mobilisation, more intensive
international scrutiny, and the inherently high-risk nature of overturning
electoral outcomes. These factors may increase the probability of failure for
incumbents who pursue this path.

Notably, in contrast to classical coups, which predominantly occur in autocratic
regimes, a substantial proportion of autocoups take place in democratic settings.
Of the 83 identified autocoup attempts, 30 took place in democracies—of which 29
occurred in presidential democracies—constituting approximately $36\%$ of the
total. By comparison, traditional coups have been significantly less frequent in
democratic contexts, with only 99 out of 493 cases ( $20\%$ ) taking place in
such regimes. This marked disparity will be examined in greater depth in Chapter
3.

### Case studies

#### High frequency and success rate of autocoups in post-communist regimes {.unnumbered}

The dataset reveals a notably high incidence and success rate of autocoup
attempts in post-communist states. These countries, which were governed under
communist rule prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, have predominantly
transitioned into so-called ‘hybrid regimes’ [@nurumov2019], with only a few—most
notably China—retaining an overtly communist political identity. Within these
contexts, the dataset records 12 attempts by incumbents to extend their tenure,
of which only two were unsuccessful. A closer examination of these cases reveals
several shared structural and political characteristics.

Firstly, many post-communist regimes inherited authoritarian institutional
legacies. While they formally transitioned away from communism, these states
often preserved core authoritarian features, particularly the centralisation of
executive authority.

Secondly, elite continuity has been a hallmark of post-communist transitions.
Rather than a clear break with the previous regime, many transitions saw the
retention of former communist elites, who reconstituted themselves within
ostensibly democratic frameworks, frequently dominating newly formed political
institutions.

Thirdly, democratic procedures have frequently been subverted in post-communist
contexts. Although democratic reforms introduced elections and constitutional
term limits, the enduring institutional structures of communist rule have often
facilitated the manipulation of electoral processes and the circumvention of
formal constraints on executive power [@nurumov2019].

##### Lifelong ruler: Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus {.unnumbered}

Alexander Lukashenko, a former member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian
SSR, rose to national prominence as the head of Belarus’s interim anti-corruption
committee following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 1994, he was elected
as the country’s first president, a position he has held continuously throughout
the period under examination. The original 1994 constitution imposed a two-term
limit on the presidency; however, this restriction was repealed in 2004 through a
constitutional amendment.

Since his initial election, international observers have consistently found that
Belarusian elections fall short of democratic standards. Despite sustained
domestic opposition and recurrent mass protests, Lukashenko has claimed repeated
re-election victories, frequently with vote shares exceeding $80\%$. This
trajectory is emblematic of a broader pattern across the post-Soviet space,
particularly in Central Asia, where former high-ranking communist officials
transitioned into presidential office and have retained power with limited
institutional constraints.

##### Dynastic succession: Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan {.unnumbered}

Nursultan Nazarbayev served as the first president of independent Kazakhstan from
1991 until 2019. Prior to independence, he was the First Secretary of the
Communist Party of Kazakhstan, thereby exercising de facto leadership both before
and after the Soviet collapse. Following independence, Nazarbayev was elected
president and remained in power through a series of constitutional and legal
modifications, including the adoption of new constitutions that effectively reset
term limits.

Importantly, Nazarbayev did not formally abolish term limits. Rather, a
constitutional exemption was created specifically for the “First President”,
allowing him to circumvent term restrictions while maintaining a veneer of legal
continuity [@nurumov2019]. Unlike Lukashenko, who has remained in office
continuously since 1994 up to the time of this study, Nazarbayev formally
resigned in 2019, designating Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as his successor. However,
Nazarbayev continued to exercise significant influence through his position as
Chairman of the Security Council, a role he retained until 2022. This illustrates
the persistence of informal executive dominance even after nominal power has been
relinquished.

#### Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin America {.unnumbered}

Latin America has a longstanding tradition of imposing constitutional term limits
on executive authority. Simón Bolívar, often regarded as a founding father of
several Latin American republics, initially endorsed this principle, declaring in
1819 that “nothing is as dangerous as allowing the same citizen to remain in
power for a long time... That is the origin of usurpation and tyranny”
[@ginsburg2019, p. 38]. Although Bolívar later revised his stance—asserting in
his 1826 address to the Constitutional Assembly that "a president for life with
the right to choose the successor is the most sublime inspiration for the
republican order"—the concept of term limitation became deeply ingrained in the
region’s political culture. Indeed, approximately 81% of Latin American
constitutions adopted between independence and 1985 included some form of
presidential term limit [@marsteintredet2019a].

An analysis of autocoup cases in the region reveals two noteworthy patterns
regarding re-election dynamics.

##### Frequent success in breaking non-re-election rules {.unnumbered}

Unlike many presidential systems in which two consecutive terms are the norm,
Latin American constitutions have historically favoured more restrictive
arrangements. According to @marsteintredet2019a, $64.9\%$ of constitutions in the
region between independence and 1985 prohibited immediate re-election, while
$5.9\%$ forbade re-election altogether.

Nevertheless, adherence to these rules has varied. Countries such as Mexico,
which enshrined a strict non-re-election clause in 1911 at the outset of the
Mexican Revolution, have consistently upheld this restriction [@klesner2019].
Panama and Uruguay have similarly refrained from amending their re-election
provisions, while Costa Rica has permitted immediate re-election only briefly
(1897–1913) since its initial prohibition in 1859 [@marsteintredet2019a]. In
contrast, several states have frequently amended or circumvented their
constitutional term limits.

The pursuit of re-election or immediate re-election has often served as a central
motive for autocoup attempts aimed at consolidating executive power. This study
identifies 22 autocoup cases in Latin America, of which 14 (over $63\%$ )
involved efforts to enable re-election or immediate re-election. Of these, 9 were
successful, yielding a success rate exceeding $64\%$.

Importantly, not all such leaders sought indefinite tenure. Many stepped down
after securing and completing a second term. Notable examples include Fernando
Henrique Cardoso (Brazil, 1995–2003), Danilo Medina (Dominican Republic,
2012–2020), and Juan Orlando Hernández (Honduras, 2014–2022) [@ginsburg2019;
@marsteintredet2019a; @landau2019; @baturo2019; @neto2019].

##### Resistance to further extensions {.unnumbered}

The relative restraint exhibited by many leaders should not be interpreted as a
lack of ambition for further tenure. Rather, it reflects the fact that additional
extension attempts often failed, and incumbents acquiesced to these outcomes
without resorting to overt manipulation or repression.

While autocoups that enable a single additional term tend to be relatively
successful, efforts to prolong tenure beyond two terms encounter greater
resistance and are more likely to fail. Two contrasting cases illustrate these
divergent trajectories.

**Unsuccessful extension–Carlos Menem (Argentina):** President Menem secured a
second term following a 1994 constitutional amendment permitting one re-election,
and he was re-elected in 1995. However, his subsequent attempt to reset the term
count—arguing that his first term (1988–1995) had occurred under a previous
constitutional framework—was unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court in 1999
[@llanos2019]. A comparable outcome was observed in the case of President Álvaro
Uribe in Colombia (2002–2010) [@baturo2019].

**Successful extension–Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua):** In contrast, President Daniel
Ortega of Nicaragua succeeded in extending his tenure through a series of
judicial and legislative manoeuvres. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice
authorised his candidacy for the 2011 election. Subsequently, in 2014, the
National Assembly passed constitutional amendments abolishing presidential term
limits, thereby enabling Ortega to pursue indefinite five-year terms. He has
remained in office continuously since 2007 [@close2019].

Classical coups have historically been widespread across the African continent,
accounting for approximately $45\%$ of all coups globally—219 out of 493 recorded
incidents since 1950—affecting 45 of the 54 African states [@powell2011]. While
autocoups occur less frequently than traditional coups, they nonetheless
represent a significant political phenomenon within Africa. Of the 83 documented
cases of autocoups worldwide, $43\%$ (36 cases) have taken place on the
continent, spanning 29 countries. Notably, the success rate of African autocoups
exceeds $77\%$ (28 out of 36), a figure that significantly surpasses the regional
success rate for classical coups (approximately $50\%$ ) and aligns with the
global average success rate for autocoups ( $77\%$ ).

Identifying a clear and consistent pattern underpinning autocoups in Africa
remains a considerable challenge, reflecting the broader analytical complexity
long associated with classical coups. Nevertheless, the literature has proposed
several explanatory factors.

First, natural resource wealth has been identified as a key variable. States
endowed with oil, diamonds, or other strategic commodities often present
incumbents with both greater incentives and enhanced capacities to pursue term
extensions and entrench their authority [@posner; @cheeseman2015;
@cheeseman2019a].

Second, the quality of democracy plays a crucial role. Higher levels of
democratic consolidation are strongly associated with greater adherence to
constitutional term limits [@reyntjens2016].

Third, international influence may act as a constraint. External actors—including
bilateral donors and international organisations—can exert diplomatic or economic
pressure to discourage leaders from circumventing term limits [@brown2001;
@tangri2010].

Finally, opposition strength and ruling party cohesion are critical domestic
factors. The effectiveness of opposition forces in coordinating resistance, as
well as the incumbent’s ability to preserve unity within the ruling party,
significantly shapes the political feasibility of tenure extensions
[@cheeseman2019].

Drawing on the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, @cassani2020
identifies human rights abuses and the desire to evade legal or political
accountability as key motivations behind efforts to overstay in power. The more
authoritarian a leader’s governing style, the more likely they are to challenge
constitutional constraints. Moreover, incumbents who can secure the loyalty of
the military—often through strategic use of public investment—are significantly
more likely to succeed in extending their tenure.

Although both classical coups and autocoups continue to be features of African
politics, a marked shift has occurred since the end of the Cold War in 1991.
While the incidence of traditional coups has declined, autocoups have become
increasingly prevalent. This trend is partly attributable to the widespread
adoption of multiparty electoral systems in the 1990s, often accompanied by the
formal institutionalisation of presidential term limits [@cassani2020;
@cheeseman2019].

Prior to 1991, personalist and military regimes predominated across much of the
continent, and constitutional term limits were seldom enshrined. The post-Cold
War expansion of democratic frameworks contributed to a rise in the adoption of
such provisions, and, correspondingly, in attempts to circumvent them. However,
it is important to stress that this increase in challenges to term limits should
not be interpreted as indicative of declining compliance. On the contrary,
overall turnover in executive leadership has increased compared to earlier
decades, suggesting that while violations continue to attract attention,
adherence to constitutional rules has become more widespread.

### Summary

This chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of autocoups, examining political
instances where incumbent leaders extend their tenure beyond constitutionally
mandated limits. By refining existing definitions and distinguishing autocoups
from related concepts—such as self-coups, autogolpes, and executive
takeovers—this study introduces an original dataset that catalogues 83 cases of
autocoups from 1945 to 2023, of which 64 were successful. The revised conceptual
framework, in conjunction with the newly assembled dataset, facilitates a more
expansive and systematic analysis of irregular leadership transitions. Whereas
traditional scholarship has primarily focused on the premature termination of
leadership through coups, this study broadens the analytical scope to encompass
irregular tenure extensions. This approach provides a more nuanced understanding
of the methods by which incumbents may subvert constitutional norms and
democratic procedures to consolidate their authority.

Nevertheless, several limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, the proposed
definition of an autocoup requires further scholarly scrutiny and debate to
achieve broader consensus. Despite rigorous efforts to ensure consistency,
certain coding decisions—particularly in ambiguous or borderline cases—may
inevitably entail an element of subjective judgement. Secondly, while this thesis
focuses on tenure extensions, instances involving the expansion of executive
power without a formal extension of tenure also merit deeper conceptual and
empirical investigation. Despite these constraints, the research makes a
substantive contribution to the literature on political stability, leadership
dynamics, and democratic resilience. The dataset offers a valuable empirical
foundation for future inquiries into the mechanisms and motivations underpinning
autocoups. Several promising avenues for further research emerge. Subsequent
studies could utilise the dataset to investigate the long-term institutional
consequences of autocoups, including their role in democratic backsliding,
authoritarian entrenchment, and the personalisation of executive power.
Furthermore, comparative analyses between autocoups and traditional coups may
shed light on the evolving strategies employed by incumbents to consolidate
authority across diverse regime types and political environments.

## Power Dynamics and Autocoup Attempts {#sec-chapter2}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter explores the determinants of autocoup attempts, aiming to deepen
understanding of the political dynamics that underpin tenure extensions by
incumbent leaders. Addressing a notable gap in the existing literature, the study
contends that the balance of power plays a critical role in shaping the
likelihood of autocoup events. In contrast to classical coups—which are often
triggered by unstable or fragmented power structures—autocoups tend to arise in
contexts characterised by stable and concentrated power.

To operationalise the concept of power balance in an observable manner, regime
type is employed as a proxy, reflecting the structural distribution of power
between incumbents and potential institutional constraints or elite challengers.
Using a bias-reduced logistic regression model, the analysis finds that regime
type is a significant predictor of autocoup attempts. Leaders operating within
regimes marked by concentrated power are more prone to extend their tenure
unconstitutionally. In particular, presidential democracies and personalist
autocracies are found to be significantly more susceptible to autocoup attempts
than dominant-party regimes.

The study contributes to the broader literature on irregular leadership
transitions by offering a more systematic and empirically grounded account of the
conditions under which incumbents seek to subvert constitutional term limits.

### Introduction

As outlined in Chapter 2, scholarly engagement with autocoups has been hampered
by conceptual ambiguity and the absence of systematic data, thereby limiting the
scope for rigorous empirical investigation. To address this lacuna, the present
chapter aims to make a substantive contribution through a quantitative analysis
of the determinants of autocoup attempts. Following the methodological precedent
established by empirical studies of classical coups—which have primarily examined
the antecedents of coup initiation [@gassebner2016]—this chapter similarly
explores why some incumbent leaders attempt to extend their tenure through
autocoups, while others do not.

There are three principal reasons for investigating the determinants of
autocoups. First, autocoups constitute one of the most prevalent forms of
irregular leadership transition, with over 80 documented cases since 1945 (as
discussed in Chapter 2). Their frequency has increased notably since 2000,
coinciding with a marked global decline in classical coups [@bermeo2016;
@thyne2019]. Second, autocoups exert profound effects on political stability and
democratic development, often resulting in enduring institutional degradation.
Third, identifying the drivers of autocoup attempts is essential for future
research into their consequences; without a clear understanding of the conditions
under which autocoups occur, efforts to prevent them or mitigate their
detrimental effects remain constrained.

Although autocoups differ fundamentally from classical coups—particularly in that
they are instigated by incumbents rather than external challengers—the two
phenomena share key features as disruptions to established political order.
Accordingly, methodological tools commonly applied in the study of traditional
coups may be fruitfully adapted to analyse autocoups. However, despite the
extensive literature on coup dynamics [@gassebner2016], regime type is frequently
treated as a background condition or control variable rather than a central
explanatory factor.

This chapter advances the argument that the likelihood of autocoup attempts is
shaped significantly by the structural distribution of power inherent in regime
type. In contrast to classical coups, which often emerge from unstable or
contested power structures, autocoups tend to occur in regimes characterised by
concentrated and stable authority. Given the challenges of directly measuring
internal power configurations, regime type is employed as a proxy variable. The
underlying premise is that regime type reflects core institutional arrangements,
including the distribution of authority, the robustness of constitutional
constraints, and the capacity of incumbents to subvert democratic norms.
Analysing cross-regime variation thus facilitates a deeper understanding of the
institutional foundations that condition autocoup risk. These power structures
tend to be relatively stable over time, as they both shape and are shaped by the
regime’s overarching institutional design [@geddes2014].

To empirically test this proposition, the chapter utilises both a standard
logistic regression model and a bias-reduced logistic regression model to assess
how regime type influences the likelihood of incumbents extending their tenure
through extra-constitutional means.

Given the paucity of quantitative research on autocoups, this study offers a
potentially pioneering contribution to the empirical literature by providing a
theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous account of their
determinants.

The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 examines the
dynamics and outcomes of autocoup attempts. Section 3 outlines the research
design, including the methodological approach and variables employed. Section 4
presents and interprets the empirical findings, highlighting key patterns and
implications. Section 5 concludes by summarising the core insights and reflecting
on their broader significance for understanding and mitigating the risks posed by
autocoups.

### Dynamics of autocoup attempts

Like traditional coup attempts, autocoups are shaped by two fundamental elements:
the disposition of incumbent leaders—referring to their motivations and
willingness to act—and their capability, defined by the resources and
opportunities at their disposal. However, autocoups exhibit two notable features
that distinguish them from classical coups. First, whereas traditional coups
occur predominantly in autocracies [@thyne2014], over one-third of documented
autocoups have taken place in democratic regimes, as outlined in Chapter 2.
Second, while the success rate of traditional coups hovers around $50\%$, more
than $77\%$ of autocoup attempts have resulted in success, according to the
dataset introduced in Chapter 2. These distinctions indicate that the dynamics of
disposition and capability underlying autocoups differ significantly from those
of traditional coups.

This section explores the complex dynamics of autocoup attempts, with particular
emphasis on how the motivations of incumbents, the determinants of success, and
the institutional frameworks of various regime types shape the vulnerability of
states to such extra-constitutional power extensions.

#### Motivations for autocoups {.unnumbered}

Incumbents seeking to prolong their tenure may be driven by a range of
motivations, broadly falling into three principal categories: personal ambition,
appeals to national interest, and self-preservation.

First, the pursuit of personal power constitutes a compelling incentive for many
leaders. The capacity to govern free from institutional constraints enables
incumbents to exercise dominance over national policy-making, access state
resources, influence the judiciary and legislature, and retain the prestige
associated with holding high office. For some, the aspiration to secure a lasting
political legacy—to be remembered as a transformative figure—further amplifies
the appeal of extended rule.

Second, tenure extensions are often justified by incumbents in the name of the
national interest. A commonly advanced rationale suggests that a single term is
insufficient for the completion of long-term reforms or development initiatives.
Within this narrative, remaining in power is portrayed as essential to ensuring
the continuity and success of ongoing projects. The autocoup is thus framed not
as an act of self-interest, but as a necessary step for the greater good.

Third, autocoups may serve as mechanisms of self-preservation. Incumbents facing
the prospect of prosecution for corruption, human rights violations, or other
transgressions may view continued tenure as a means of preserving legal immunity.
Additionally, those who have amassed significant political adversaries during
their rule may fear retribution upon leaving office. In such cases, the extension
of power is not merely a product of ambition but also a strategy for
survival—intended to shield the leader from legal or political repercussions.

#### Power dynamics and autocoups {.unnumbered}

While motivations may initiate an incumbent’s decision to pursue an autocoup, the
decisive factor often lies in their ability to implement and sustain such an
action. The relatively high frequency and remarkable success rate of
autocoups—over $77%$, compared to approximately $50\%$ for classical
coups—suggest that incumbents benefit from notable structural advantages when
attempting to consolidate power. These advantages are not limited to autocracies
but are also evident in democratic systems, underscoring the variation in
institutional leverage available to incumbents across different regime types.

This reality necessitates a closer examination of state power structures,
particularly the allocation of control over the military. The allegiance of the
armed forces is a critical determinant of autocoup outcomes. If the military
remains loyal to the executive, resistance—whether from civil society, the
judiciary, or the legislature—can be suppressed or marginalised. Conversely, open
defiance or refusal by the military to support the incumbent may render an
autocoup untenable.

Nevertheless, it is reductive to assume that formal authority as
commander-in-chief guarantees unqualified control. Just as it is overly
simplistic to attribute the success of traditional coups solely to the presence
of military force [@singh2016], it is equally erroneous to presume that
incumbents invariably enjoy the unconditional loyalty of the armed forces.
Nominal titles often obscure the complex and sometimes precarious dynamics
underpinning military allegiance.

In autocratic regimes, while the military may not be bound by constitutional
principles, it is not inherently loyal to the head of state. Executives depend on
military officers to execute their commands; however, these officers may harbour
independent political ambitions or competing loyalties. A case in point is Uganda
in 1971, when President Milton Obote attempted to dismiss General Idi Amin. In
response, Amin exploited his influence within the armed forces to mount a
successful coup, ousting Obote [@sudduth2017].

By contrast, in consolidated democracies, military loyalty is typically
institutionalised through allegiance to the constitution rather than to
individual officeholders. For example, in the United States, following the 2020
presidential election, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, publicly reaffirmed the military’s constitutional commitment: “We are
unique among militaries. We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a tyrant or
a dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the
Constitution.” (US Army Museum, 12 November 2020[^1])

In hybrid regimes or fragile democracies, attempts to prolong executive tenure
may entail significant political risks. In Niger, for example, President Mamadou
Tandja’s attempt in 2009 to amend the constitution to permit a third term
precipitated a military coup in 2010 [@miller2016]. Similarly, in Honduras the
same year, President Manuel Zelaya was removed from office by the military after
seeking to alter the constitution to allow immediate re-election
[@muñoz-portillo2019].

#### Regime types and autocoups {.unnumbered}

Given the complexities discussed, a more effective analytical strategy entails
evaluating the broader balance of power within political systems. As direct
observation of this balance is inherently challenging, this study adopts regime
type as a proxy—an approach consistent with established methodologies in
comparative politics. Regime types encapsulate the institutional architecture of
power distribution, particularly with respect to control over the military,
political appointments, and policy-making authority.

Following the typology developed by @geddes2014, autocratic regimes can be
categorised as follows:

**Military regimes** are governed by a junta, typically comprising senior
military officers who collectively determine leadership and policy direction.
Notable examples include Brazil (1964–1985), Argentina (1976–1983), and El
Salvador (1948–1984) [@geddes1999].

**Personalist regimes** revolve around a dominant individual who wields unchecked
authority over the military, policy decisions, and succession processes.
Prominent instances include Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic
(1930–1961), Idi Amin in Uganda (1971–1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the
Central African Republic (1966–1979) [@geddes1999].

**Dominant-party regimes** concentrate authority within a structured political
party, with the leader operating either as part of or at the helm of the party
apparatus. Illustrative cases include the PRI in Mexico, CCM in Tanzania, and the
Leninist parties of Eastern Europe [@geddes1999].

Among these regime types, personalist autocracies are particularly conducive to
autocoups. The concentration of power in a single individual weakens
institutional checks and fosters loyalty—particularly from the military—through
mechanisms of personal patronage. While military regimes are rooted in coercive
power, they are often beset by internal factionalism, rendering them more
susceptible to traditional coups than to autocoups. Dominant-party regimes occupy
a more ambiguous position: although party structures can constrain executive
action, exceptionally powerful party leaders may still initiate autocoups, as
exemplified by Xi Jinping’s constitutional amendments in 2018 within a
dominant-party framework.

Monarchies, though technically autocratic, generally render autocoups redundant,
as monarchs typically rule for life by constitutional design.

A key clarification is warranted at this juncture: why might leaders in
personalist regimes—already possessing extensive authority—feel compelled to
extend their tenure further? The answer lies in distinguishing between the scope
and duration of power. While such leaders may exercise considerable de facto
control over state institutions, many initially assume office via legal or
constitutional channels, necessitating a gradual process of consolidation. In
this context, autocoups function as formal mechanisms to institutionalise
existing dominance—transforming informal power into legally sanctioned
permanence. This dynamic is exemplified by the repeated tenure extensions pursued
by Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko.

In post-Soviet Russia, President Boris Yeltsin presided over the transformation
of a parliamentary system into a personalist regime. However, Yeltsin himself did
not overstay his term; instead, he designated Vladimir Putin as his successor.
Upon assuming office in 2000, Putin progressively entrenched his authority,
employing constitutional amendments and legal strategies to circumvent term
limits and extend his rule indefinitely.

Likewise, in Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko was elected president in 1994 under a
party-based system. Within a year, he dismantled the existing institutional
framework and established a personalist regime. Since then, he has remained in
power through successive tenure extensions, steadily consolidating his control
over the state apparatus.

In democratic contexts, autocoups are found exclusively in presidential systems.
This reflects the institutional leverage enjoyed by presidents, who are directly
elected, typically command the armed forces, and may possess the capacity to
override or circumvent legislative opposition. By contrast, prime ministers in
parliamentary systems are considerably more constrained. Their tenure depends on
maintaining legislative confidence and they may be removed through votes of no
confidence. Moreover, they often lack direct control over the military, which is
institutionally separated from their office. As a result, prime ministers are
subject to more frequent leadership turnover and face fewer opportunities to
unilaterally extend their mandates. For instance, the United Kingdom saw three
prime ministers serve in 2022 alone, while Japan has had 36 prime ministers since
1945—an average of one every two years. In contrast, only 14 presidents have
served in the United States over the same period, reflecting greater
institutional continuity. These structural distinctions render presidential
systems more conducive to autocoups—even within well-established democracies—due
to their centralised executive authority and command over the military.

From this analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:

The likelihood of autocoup attempts is significantly shaped by regime type, with
regimes characterised by concentrated and stable executive power—namely,
personalist autocracies and presidential democracies—being the most susceptible,
relative to other regime types.

***H3-1: The likelihood of autocoup attempts is significantly shaped by regime
type, with regimes characterised by concentrated and stable executive
power—namely, personalist autocracies and presidential democracies—being the most
susceptible, relative to other regime types.***

### Research design

#### Methodology {.unnumbered}

Given the binary nature of the dependent variable—namely, whether an autocoup is
attempted in a given country-year—the study initially employs a logistic
regression model to investigate the determinants of autocoup attempts. This
method enables the identification of statistically significant factors
influencing the likelihood of such events, as well as the direction and magnitude
of their effects.

Nevertheless, the rarity of autocoup incidents—83 cases out of over 9,000
observations—poses a methodological challenge. Standard maximum likelihood
estimation techniques, including conventional logit and probit models, are prone
to underestimating the probability of rare events. To mitigate this limitation
and improve the robustness of statistical inference, the analysis also employs
Firth’s Bias-Reduced Penalised Maximum Likelihood Estimation (commonly referred
to as Bias-Reduced Logit), as outlined by @firth1993.

#### Data and variables {.unnumbered}

The primary dataset, which incorporates information on autocoups and regime
types, spans the period from 1945 to 2023. However, due to data alignment
limitations, the usable data range extends from 1945 to 2018. The dataset
comprises approximately 9,400 country-year observations, of which 83 represent
recorded autocoup attempts.

##### Dependent variable {.unnumbered}

The analysis draws upon the autocoup dataset introduced in Chapter 2, which
covers the period from 1945 to 2023 and includes 83 documented autocoup attempts.
Summary statistics for these events, as well as the corresponding regime
classifications, are presented in Chapter 2.

**Autocoup attempt**: A binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt
occurred (coded as 1) or did not occur (coded as 0) in each country-year
observation.

##### Independent variables {.unnumbered}

The principal independent variable in this analysis is regime type, reflecting
the central analytical focus of the study. Regime classifications are drawn from
the typology developed by @geddes2014 (GWF dataset), which distinguishes among
military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes within autocratic systems. For
democratic systems, regimes are categorised as either parliamentary or
presidential. A residual category—labelled “other”—captures regimes that are
provisional, transitional, or otherwise not easily classified within the primary
typology.

In addition to regime type, a range of control variables is included, selected on
the basis of established scholarship on the determinants of coups. These controls
account for factors such as economic performance, political violence, and the
tenure of incumbents. Further controls comprise the level of democracy,
population size, and a Cold War dummy variable, which captures temporal variation
in the global political environment.

**Economic Level:** Measured by GDP per capita, this variable reflects the
overall economic wellbeing of a country. Data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset
[@fariss2022] and are expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP, per
thousand).

**Economic Performance:** Operationalised via the Current-Trend (CT) ratio
developed by @krishnarajan2019, this measure compares current GDP per capita with
the average of the previous five years. Higher CT values indicate stronger
economic growth. Formally:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \over {1 \over 5} {\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}
    \end{aligned}
$$

**Political violence:** Measured using a violence index based on the “actotal”
variable from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset
[@marshall2005current], this index captures both internal and interstate
conflict. Scores range from 0 (complete stability) to 18 (maximum instability).

**Days in office (log):** The natural logarithm of an incumbent leader’s
cumulative days in office is included as a proxy for power consolidation. Longer
tenures are hypothesised to facilitate the conditions necessary for an autocoup.
Data are drawn from the Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political
Leaders’ Affiliation Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded].

**Democratic level:** This variable employs the Polity V score to measure the
degree of democracy in a country, ranging from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10
(fully democratic). The index, developed by the Centre for Systemic Peace,
assesses regime characteristics such as the competitiveness of political
participation, executive recruitment, and constraints on executive authority
[@marshall].

**Population size:** The natural logarithm of a country’s population is included
to account for the potential effects of demographic scale on governance. Larger
populations may present more complex administrative challenges and generate
greater opposition. Data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset.

**Cold War:** Following the precedent of earlier studies [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023], a dummy variable is included to distinguish the
Cold War period (approximately 1960–1990) from the post-Cold War era. This
distinction reflects the relative paucity of autocoup events during the Cold War
and their increased frequency thereafter.

### Results and discussions

This chapter employs logistic regression techniques to examine the structural and
contextual factors that influence the probability of autocoup attempts. Given the
dichotomous nature of the dependent variable—whether or not an autocoup attempt
occurred in a specific country-year—and the rarity of such events (78 out of
9,434 observations) in certain categories, the analysis includes both a standard
logit model and a bias-reduced logit model. The latter is particularly
well-suited for rare events data, as it corrects for the small-sample bias often
encountered with conventional maximum likelihood estimation. Consequently, the
interpretation of results prioritises estimates from the bias-reduced model. Odds
Ratios (ORs) are reported to facilitate an intuitive understanding of effect
sizes.

@tbl-autocoupmodel presents the model estimates. The core hypothesis posits that
regime type is a key predictor of autocoup incidence, particularly that
personalist regimes and presidential democracies are significantly more prone to
such events than dominant-party regimes, which serve as the reference category.

The empirical results provide robust support for this hypothesis. In the
bias-reduced model, the odds of an autocoup occurring in a personalist regime are
more than twice as high as in a dominant-party regime (OR = 2.08, p \< 0.05). In
presidential democracies, the odds are nearly five times greater (OR = 4.87, p \<
0.01). To illustrate the magnitude of these effects, I compute predicted
probabilities for a prototypical country in the dataset, holding all other
covariates at their mean values. In dominant-party regimes, the predicted
probability of an autocoup in a given year is approximately 0.99%. In personalist
regimes, the probability rises to around 2.0%. In presidential democracies, the
likelihood increases further to approximately 4.7%. While these probabilities are
low in absolute terms—reflecting the rarity of autocoup events—the relative
differences are substantial. Leaders in presidential democracies, for instance,
are nearly five times more likely to attempt an autocoup than those in
dominant-party systems, holding other factors constant. This underscores the
structural vulnerability of executive-centric political systems, particularly
when institutional checks on executive power are weak.

Among other regime types, military and parliamentary democracies do not show
statistically significant differences in autocoup likelihood relative to
dominant-party regimes. The residual "other" category does reach marginal
significance (OR = 0.34, p \< 0.1), suggesting lower odds, although the
heterogeneity within this group warrants cautious interpretation.

Turning to the control variables, several findings warrant closer attention. The
Polity V score, which proxies the level of democratic institutionalisation, is
significantly associated with reduced odds of autocoup (OR = 0.91, p \< 0.01).
Substantively, this indicates that for each one-point increase in Polity score,
the odds of an autocoup decrease by approximately 9%, holding other factors
constant. This underscores the protective role of democratic institutions against
executive overreach.

The Cold War indicator also emerges as significant (OR = 0.45, p \< 0.01),
suggesting that autocoups were 55% less likely during the Cold War era than in
the post-Cold War period. This aligns with historical interpretations that view
the Cold War as imposing external constraints on authoritarian innovation, often
via superpower influence.

The analysis reveals a statistically significant, albeit marginal, negative
relationship between the log of population size and the incidence of autocoups
(OR = 0.86, p \< 0.1). This suggests that as a country's population grows, the
odds of an autocoup tend to decrease. This finding aligns with theoretical
arguments positing that larger, more populous states may exhibit greater
organizational complexity and higher visibility of executive power dynamics,
thereby increasing the difficulty and scrutiny associated with an executive power
grab.

Conversely, indicators of economic performance—including GDP per capita, GDP
growth, and political violence—do not exhibit statistically significant
relationships with the outcome variable. Likewise, the log of days in office for
the incumbent does not significantly predict autocoup attempts, suggesting that
tenure alone is not a sufficient condition for extra-constitutional moves.

In sum, the analysis confirms that regime type—particularly personalist and
presidential systems—is a critical structural condition influencing the
likelihood of autocoup attempts. The inclusion of predicted probabilities and
percentage changes in odds ratios serves to clarify the substantive significance
of these patterns, beyond their statistical robustness. These results point to
the institutional fragility of regimes where executive authority is highly
centralised and unchecked. Additionally, the protective effects of democratic
institutions and Cold War-era international structures warrant greater attention
in discussions of executive stability and regime resilience. The implications of
these findings for policy and democratic governance will be explored in detail in
the final chapter.

### Summary

This chapter provides a quantitative analysis of the determinants of autocoup
attempts, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature, which has often
been hindered by conceptual imprecision and the absence of systematic empirical
data. It advances the central argument that the likelihood of autocoup attempts
is shaped significantly by the structural configuration of political power within
regimes, operationalised through regime type. Employing both standard logistic
regression and Firth’s bias-reduced logit model, the analysis demonstrates that
personalist autocracies and presidential democracies are markedly more
susceptible to autocoup attempts than dominant-party regimes. Specifically, the
odds of an autocoup are estimated to be approximately three times higher in
personalist autocracies and nearly five times higher in presidential democracies
relative to the baseline category.

These findings lend empirical support to the hypothesis that such regime types
possess structural vulnerabilities that facilitate extra-constitutional power
consolidation by incumbents. In addition to regime type, the analysis identifies
several other statistically significant covariates: population size, the degree
of democratic institutionalisation, and the broader historical context of the
Cold War all exert discernible effects on the probability of autocoup occurrence.
By examining the strategic incentives confronting incumbent leaders across
diverse institutional contexts, the study contributes to a more nuanced
understanding of irregular leadership transitions.

Nevertheless, the analysis also underscores several conceptual and methodological
challenges that warrant further investigation. Unlike traditional coups—which may
occur at various stages of a regime’s lifespan and are often subject to
recurrence—autocoups appear to follow distinct temporal patterns. For instance,
their likelihood may be comparatively low during the initial stages of a leader’s
tenure, increasing as the conclusion of a constitutional term approaches.
Moreover, while a successful extension of tenure may reduce the short-term risk
of subsequent attempts, empirical cases such as those of Presidents Putin and
Lukashenko suggest that incumbents may engage in serial autocoup behaviour.

To render the analysis tractable, this study adopts the simplifying assumption
that an autocoup attempt occurs only once per leadership tenure. While
analytically expedient, this assumption highlights the need for future research
to explore the temporal dynamics and sequencing of autocoup activity. Such
inquiries would usefully complement the present findings by offering deeper
insights into the long-term patterns of institutional adaptation, authoritarian
durability, and democratic erosion.

## Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter examines the effect of power acquisition methods on the tenure of
political leaders, focusing in particular on those who attain office through
regular means, traditional coups, and those who subsequently extend their power
via autocoup. It was initially hypothesised that leaders who entrench their
authority through autocoups would exhibit greater longevity in office than those
installed through coups alone. However, this proposition is not substantiated by
the empirical evidence. A time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model reveals
no statistically significant difference in the risk of removal between
coup-installed and autocoup leaders, once key covariates—most notably regime
type—are controlled for.

Instead, the analysis highlights the pivotal role of regime characteristics in
determining leadership survival. Leaders operating within military or personal
regimes are shown to face significantly higher hazards of removal relative to
those in dominant-party systems. Additionally, higher levels of GDP per capita
are positively associated with leadership stability, whilst elevated levels of
political violence are linked to increased risks of removal.

These findings suggest that structural and institutional contexts exert a more
profound influence on the durability of irregular leadership than the specific
modality of power acquisition. This study contributes to the literature on
political survival by emphasising the salience of regime type and broader
political conditions in shaping the tenure of leaders who ascend to power through
non-conventional means.

### Introduction

The enduring question of why some political leaders remain in office for decades
while others are deposed within months—or even days—has long preoccupied scholars
in political science. Although a substantial body of research has addressed
leadership longevity, comparatively little attention has been devoted to a
distinct subset of leaders: those who extend their tenure through autocoups.
Analysing the survival of such leaders is essential for understanding the
dynamics underpinning irregular transitions of power and their broader
implications for political stability and democratic governance.

Leaders who ascend to office via irregular means—such as coups or
autocoups—differ markedly from those who enter through institutionalised,
constitutional procedures. The authority and legitimacy of irregular leaders are
often contested, rendering them analytically distinct and more complex to study.
Data from the Archigos dataset underscore the prevalence of such irregular
transitions: between 1945 and 2015, more than half of the leaders who entered
power irregularly also exited by irregular means—a rate substantially higher than
that observed among leaders who entered office through regular procedures
[@goemans2009].

Coup-installed and autocoup leaders constitute a significant share of these
irregular cases. According to Archigos, 246 out of 374 leaders ( $65.8\%$ ) who
exited power irregularly were removed via coups [@goemans2009]. Further, research
by @frantz2016 indicates that coups account for approximately one-third of all
exits in autocracies, marking them as the most frequent mode of leadership
transition in such regimes. Complementing this, the original dataset on autocoups
introduced in Chapter 2 records 83 autocoup attempts between 1945 and 2023, of
which 64 were successful. This provides a foundation for empirical analysis of
post-event survival among autocoup leaders.

  )

```

Assessing the tenure of leaders who come to power through coups or autocoups
presents notable methodological challenges, owing to the volatility and
unpredictability that characterise these irregular modes of accession.
Nonetheless, comparative evidence—excluding leaders who remained in office for
fewer than 180 days—suggests that those who extend their rule via autocoups tend
to enjoy longer average post-event tenures (approximately `r avg$avg[3]` years)
than those who originally enter through coups (approximately `r avg$avg[2]`
years), indicating a potential tenure gap of around 3 years.

```

Preliminary survival analysis, as illustrated by the log-rank test in
@fig-logrank, reveals a statistically significant difference in tenure length
between coup-installed and autocoup leaders. The survival curve for autocoup
leaders consistently lies above that for coup-installed leaders, suggesting both
a lower hazard of removal and longer durations in office for the former.

This study posits that the method of power acquisition plays a significant role
in determining leadership survival. Leaders installed through coups may confront
greater resistance or experience heightened institutional fragility, thereby
contributing to shorter average tenures. Employing Cox proportional hazards and
time-dependent Cox models, the analysis supports this hypothesis by showing that
autocoup leaders tend to remain in office longer than their coup-installed
counterparts.

This research makes two principal contributions to the literature on political
survival. First, it introduces the mode of accession to power as a previously
under-explored explanatory factor. Second, through the application of survival
models, it provides robust empirical evidence of the significant disparities in
tenure between autocoup and coup-installed leaders. These findings may help
explain the increasing prevalence of autocoup-driven tenure extensions since the
early 2000s, as incumbents observe and emulate the apparent success of prior
cases.

The remainder of this chapter is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews the
relevant literature on political survival, establishing the theoretical framework
for the analysis. Section 3 explores the key factors that influence the tenure of
coup-installed and autocoup leaders. Section 4 outlines the methodological
approach and data sources, with particular emphasis on survival analysis
techniques. Section 5 presents the empirical findings and discusses their
implications. Finally, Section 6 offers concluding reflections and considers the
broader significance of the findings for political stability and democratic
development.

### Literature review

The longevity of political leaders, which varies markedly across regimes,
countries, and historical periods, has long been a focal point of inquiry within
political science. Research in this field is generally categorised into two
interrelated strands: regime survival and individual leader survival. While the
former concerns the endurance of political systems—such as monarchies, dominant
parties, or ideological frameworks—the latter focuses on the duration of
individual leaders’ tenure in office.

Patterns of political survival differ significantly across regime types. For
instance, parliamentary democracies (e.g., Japan and the United Kingdom) often
witness sustained party dominance alongside frequent leadership turnover.
Similarly, communist regimes (e.g., China) are typically characterised by stable
party control but relatively frequent changes in leadership. In contrast,
presidential systems (e.g., the United States) and many military regimes tend to
exhibit more frequent changes in both leadership and ruling entity.

The existing literature on leader survival is both extensive and diverse. Some
studies investigate mechanisms that influence leadership durability within
specific regime types, such as democracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies
[@davenport2021]. Others attempt to formulate more general theoretical frameworks
applicable across various political systems [@buenodemesquita2003]. Despite these
efforts, the ambition of constructing a universal theory of leadership survival
remains elusive due to the inherent complexities across regime contexts.

Mechanisms of leadership transition vary substantially between democracies and
autocracies. In autocratic regimes, leadership selection processes are often
closed, with access restricted to a limited elite. Even when elections are held,
meaningful competition is frequently constrained by structural or legal barriers.
The opacity of leadership transitions in autocracies complicates assessments of
popular support and renders concepts such as selectorates or winning coalitions,
as theorised by @buenodemesquita2003, difficult to operationalise.

Given these challenges, focusing research on specific categories of leaders may
yield more analytically fruitful outcomes. The study of irregular leaders—those
who ascend to power via coups or extend their rule through autocoups—offers a
compelling line of inquiry due to the distinctive uncertainty and volatility that
characterise their tenures.

Two dominant perspectives have emerged in the literature to explain leader
survival. The first emphasises objective structural factors and material
resources, such as individual competence [@yu2016], societal stability
[@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999; @williams2011], natural
resource wealth [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012; @wright2013], and external
support [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017]. The second perspective focuses on
subjective dimensions and strategic choices, including policy decisions,
management of opposition, and mechanisms for consolidating authority
[@gandhi2007; @morrison2009; @escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].

Coups, a critical form of irregular leadership transition, have garnered
substantial scholarly attention. Research has examined strategies for coup
prevention [@powell2017; @sudduth2017; @debruin2020], as well as the effects of
coups on leadership trajectories and the subsequent behaviour of coup leaders
[@sudduth2017; @sudduth2018; @easton2018].

Despite this body of work, a significant lacuna remains in the comparative
analysis of leadership survival between coup-installed and autocoup leaders. This
study seeks to address this gap by examining and comparing the tenure lengths of
leaders emerging from these two distinct forms of irregular power acquisition.

By centring its analysis on the survival of coup-installed versus autocoup
leaders, this research aims to enhance our understanding of political longevity
in the context of irregular leadership transitions. Such a focus promises to
yield important insights into the strategic and structural conditions that
underpin leadership durability in diverse political environments.

### Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-installed leaders

The study of leadership survival within political systems poses significant
methodological and conceptual challenges, owing to the opaque and complex nature
of power transitions. These very challenges, however, underscore the importance
of such inquiry, as it illuminates the often-neglected dynamics of political
leadership. While the survival trajectories of individual leaders vary
considerably, discernible patterns can be identified. Leaders emerging from
similar origins or operating within comparable regime types frequently display
analogous characteristics, thereby enabling systematic and meaningful comparative
analysis.

#### Key definitions and scope {.unnumbered}

Prior to undertaking a comparative analysis, it is essential to establish clear
definitions of key terms to ensure conceptual clarity and analytical coherence.
The definitions employed in this chapter align with those presented in Chapter 2.

Autocoup leaders are defined as incumbent rulers who utilise extra-constitutional
measures to prolong their tenure in office. In contrast, coup-installed leaders
are those who ascend to power following a successful coup, irrespective of
whether they personally orchestrated or participated in the coup. This inclusive
definition encompasses both coup perpetrators and individuals subsequently
appointed to lead, thereby offering a comprehensive perspective on leadership
following violent or forceful regime change.

Three clarifications are warranted in delineating the analytical scope. First is
about the minimum tenure threshold. To facilitate a meaningful and robust
analysis, the study imposes a minimum threshold of six months in office for both
autocoup and coup-installed leaders. This criterion serves to exclude brief or
interim leadership episodes that are less analytically relevant to the study of
survival dynamics, thereby enhancing the reliability of the findings.

Second is the potential overlap in leadership categories. Some cases may present
ambiguities due to overlapping leadership pathways. A notable example is Zine El
Abidine Ben Ali, who assumed the presidency of Tunisia in 1987 following a
bloodless coup that removed President Habib Bourguiba on grounds of ill health.
In 2002, Ben Ali further consolidated power through a constitutional referendum
that removed term limits and raised the presidential age cap from 70 to 75 years
[@bonci2019]. This latter manoeuvre could be construed as an autocoup.
Nevertheless, since Ben Ali initially came to power via the 1987 coup and
remained in office continuously, he is classified in this study as a
coup-installed leader. To preserve analytical consistency and prevent category
overlap, this study adopts the rule that any leader who initially acquires office
through a coup is categorised as coup-installed, even if they later consolidate
or extend their rule through elections or extra-constitutional means.

Third is the focus on post-event tenure. The analysis compares the post-autocoup
tenure of autocoup leaders with the post-coup tenure of coup-installed leaders.
Any period served by autocoup leaders prior to the tenure-extending manoeuvre is
excluded. This approach ensures a like-for-like comparison by focusing on the
period of leadership characterised by irregular legitimacy and heightened
political uncertainty. Both categories of leaders share key characteristics—such
as limited institutional legitimacy, increased exposure to instability, and
dependence on coercive or extra-legal mechanisms—which render the comparison
analytically fruitful.

#### Challenges in power consolidation {.unnumbered}

Both autocoup and coup-installed leaders encounter distinct challenges in
consolidating power, largely arising from the differing intensity of issues
related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. These disparities create
an uneven political landscape, placing coup-installed leaders at a marked
disadvantage. @tbl-leaders presents a comparative overview of the principal
characteristics of autocoup and coup-installed leaders, highlighting these
critical differences.

\elandscape

##### Illegitimacy {.unnumbered}

Although both categories of leaders face legitimacy deficits, the nature and
perception of this deficit vary considerably.

For coup-installed leaders, illegitimacy is overt and unequivocal, stemming from
the direct—often violent—seizure of power. Such abrupt disruptions to established
political norms and institutions elicit immediate condemnation, both domestically
and internationally, and cast doubt on the regime's authority from the outset.

By contrast, autocoup leaders adopt a more covert and strategic approach,
utilising legal and institutional mechanisms to lend a veneer of democratic
legitimacy. Though often superficial, this legalistic veneer can obscure the
authoritarian nature of their actions, offering a temporary shield from domestic
opposition and international scrutiny while they seek to consolidate power.

##### Uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The irregular accession of both types of leaders generates uncertainty regarding
the durability of their rule and the modalities of succession. However, the
nature and sources of this uncertainty differ markedly.

Coup-installed leaders confront a triad of uncertainties. First, the immediate
post-coup environment frequently involves intense power struggles within the
military or ruling coalition, creating ambiguity over who will ultimately
prevail. Second, their tenure is intrinsically unstable, threatened by internal
rivalries, popular mobilisation, or the prospect of counter-coups. Third, the
absence of institutionalised succession mechanisms exacerbates this
unpredictability, heightening the risk of future instability.

Autocoup leaders, while not entirely insulated from uncertainty, typically face
fewer ambiguities. As incumbents, they retain formal authority post-autocoup,
thereby eliminating immediate succession questions. Moreover, autocoup leaders
often articulate explicit ambitions to prolong their rule indefinitely, or
through gradual extensions, cultivating an image of continuity. This perceived
stability—whether genuine or contrived—may foster a more predictable political
climate in the short term.

##### Instability {.unnumbered}

The combination of legitimacy deficits and enduring uncertainty inevitably
fosters insecurity and a sense of political fragility. Consequently, both
autocoup and coup-installed leaders prioritise strategies to stabilise their
regimes. However, the scale and nature of these challenges differ.

Coup-installed leaders typically face the formidable task of reconfiguring
political power from the ground up. This often involves purging opponents,
suppressing dissent, and restructuring institutional frameworks. Such aggressive
measures can provoke significant resistance, alienate potential allies, and
incite societal unrest. Moreover, the imperative to appease powerful domestic and
international actors may force these leaders into precarious compromises that
further undermine their authority.

In contrast, autocoup leaders often benefit from a degree of institutional
continuity and regime loyalty. This relative stability enables them to pursue
consolidation incrementally, reducing the likelihood of immediate backlash. While
opposition may persist, autocoup leaders are generally less exposed to
existential threats in the early stages of their extended rule, affording them
greater latitude to entrench their authority.

Understanding these contrasting challenges allows for a more refined appreciation
of the strategic environments in which irregular leaders operate. This
comparative lens provides a valuable framework for analysing the divergent
pathways to power consolidation, and the varied tools and tactics employed by
autocoup and coup-installed leaders in navigating the precarious terrain of
non-traditional political ascension.

#### Empirical evidence and hypothesis {.unnumbered}

Empirical evidence underscores the relative disadvantage faced by coup-installed
leaders, revealing a complex interplay between historical patterns, difficulties
in consolidating power, and variations in leadership longevity. This section
presents key empirical findings and introduces the central hypothesis that guides
this study.

Data analysis indicates a strong correlation between the frequency of coup
attempts within a given country and the likelihood of future coups. Notably, more
than one-third of all coups since 1950 have taken place in the ten countries with
the highest number of coup attempts [@powell2011]. This suggests a
self-reinforcing cycle of political instability, in which each successful coup
increases the probability of further attempts, thereby cultivating an environment
of persistent uncertainty for coup-installed leaders.

The disparity in leadership duration between autocoup and coup-installed leaders
is clearly reflected in survival data. As illustrated in @fig-logrank, leaders
who extend their tenure through autocoups remain in office, on average,
approximately five years longer than those who assume power via coups. This
marked difference in tenure highlights the distinct challenges these two
categories of leaders encounter in retaining power.

The divergent consolidation environments faced by autocoup and coup-installed
leaders contribute to a self-perpetuating cycle with significant implications for
tenure length. Coup-installed leaders confront acute legitimacy deficits and
heightened internal instability; they often struggle to attract and retain
durable support, rendering them more susceptible to both internal dissent and
external pressures. Their comparatively shorter average tenures reinforce
perceptions of volatility and fragility. Autocoup leaders, by contrast,
frequently benefit from a superficial veneer of legality and enjoy a more
favourable starting position as incumbents. This allows them to consolidate
authority more effectively, cultivate elite and public support, and reduce the
immediate risk of displacement. Their longer tenures further contribute to
perceptions of regime stability. This cyclical dynamic suggests that the initial
method of acquiring or extending power has long-term implications for a leader’s
capacity to maintain their position.

Drawing upon these empirical observations and the theoretical framework outlined
in preceding sections, the following hypothesis is proposed:

***H4-1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups
are more likely to enjoy longer extended tenures than those who assume office
through coups.***

This hypothesis encapsulates the anticipated effects of the differing challenges
and advantages faced by coup-installed and autocoup leaders. By empirically
testing this claim, the study seeks to assess the impact of irregular accession
mechanisms on leadership survival, thereby advancing a more nuanced understanding
of political durability in contexts of non-traditional transitions to power.

### Research design

This section outlines the methodological framework employed to test the
hypothesis that autocoup leaders exhibit longer survival times in office than
coup-installed leaders. Survival analysis is utilised to model leadership tenure,
with Cox proportional hazards models employed to estimate the effects of leader
type while controlling for relevant covariates.

#### Methodology: Survival analysis {.unnumbered}

Two variants of the Cox model are employed to analyse the survival durations of
coup-installed and autocoup leaders.

**Cox proportional hazards (PH) model**: This model incorporates only
time-invariant covariates measured at the time of the leader’s entry into office.
It assumes that the effects of these covariates on the hazard rate remain
constant over time.

**Time-dependent Cox model**: This model allows for the inclusion of covariates
whose values may vary over time, such as indicators of economic performance and
levels of political violence. By incorporating temporal variation, this model
offers a more dynamic and nuanced analysis of leadership survival.

The Cox model is preferred over the Kaplan-Meier estimator due to its capacity to
account for multiple explanatory variables simultaneously. Although the Cox model
does not directly estimate the expected duration of tenure, it estimates the
hazard ratio, which reflects the relative risk of being removed from office. A
higher cumulative hazard corresponds to a lower probability of survival, thereby
capturing critical dynamics of leadership vulnerability over time.

#### Data and variables {.unnumbered}

The analysis relies on a set of dependent and independent variables, complemented
by a range of controls.

**Survival Time:** Measured in days, this variable captures the length of a
leader’s tenure. For coup-installed leaders, the tenure is measured from the date
of their accession via coup. For autocoup leaders, it begins on the date their
original legitimate term would have expired. For instance, Vladimir Putin assumed
the presidency of Russia in 2000, stepped down in 2008 after completing two
terms, and assumed the post of prime minister while continuing to exert de facto
control. His post-autocoup tenure, therefore, is coded as beginning in 2008.

**End Point Status:** This categorical variable indicates how a leader’s tenure
ended:

-   **0 = Censored:** Denotes leaders who exited office through regular or
    voluntary means, such as electoral defeat, term expiration, voluntary
    resignation due to health, or natural death.

-   **1 = Ousted:** Denotes leaders who were forcibly removed, including through
    coups, resignations under pressure, or assassination.

The key independent variable is the leader type, which categorizes leaders into
two distinct groups:

-   **Group A = Non-coup leader**: A leader who assumes power through regular
    means.
-   **Group B = Autocoup leader**: An incumbent who extends their tenure through
    extra-constitutional means.
-   **Group C = Coup-installed leader**: A leader who assumes power through a
    coup, whether or not they personally participated in its execution.

This variable serves as the primary explanatory factor, enabling a direct
comparison of survival outcomes between the two categories of irregular leaders.

Data for the dependent and independent variables are drawn from the newly
constructed autocoup dataset introduced in this study, as well as the Archigos
dataset [@goemans2009]and the Political Leaders and Alliances Dataset (PLAD)
[@bomprezzi2024wedded].

To isolate the effect of leader type on survival, the analysis incorporates a set
of control variables, as identified in the autocoup analysis presented in Chapter
3. These include: regime type which is categorised as democracy, hybrid regime,
or autocracy, to account for institutional differences that may influence
leadership stability; economic performance, measured through macroeconomic
indicators such as GDP growth, which may affect a leader’s ability to retain
support; political violence, captures the extent of civil conflict, repression,
or unrest, which can threaten regime stability and leadership tenure; population
size, controls for structural differences across states that may impact political
dynamics; Polity V scores, reflects the institutional characteristics and degree
of democracy or autocracy within a regime.

These control variables enhance the comparability and robustness of the
statistical models, ensuring that the estimated effects of leader type are not
confounded by broader political, economic, or demographic conditions.

### Results and discussion

#### Model results {.unnumbered}

Regression estimates from both the Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model and the
time-dependent Cox model—calculated using the survival package in R
[@survival]—are presented in @tbl-cox. These two model specifications produce
divergent findings with respect to the central question of this study: whether
the method of power acquisition significantly affects the survival prospects of
political leaders.

The Cox PH model identifies a statistically significant difference in the hazard
of removal between coup-installed and non-coup leaders. Specifically,
coup-installed leaders face a hazard ratio of 1.77 relative to non-coup leaders
(p \< 0.01), suggesting they are significantly more likely to be ousted. In
contrast, autocoup leaders exhibit a hazard ratio of 1.21, which does not reach
statistical significance. However, the time-dependent Cox model—which accounts
for time-varying covariates such as economic performance and political
violence—does not reveal any statistically significant difference in removal risk
between leader types. The hazard ratios for both autocoup (1.22) and
coup-installed (1.26) leaders are statistically indistinguishable from unity when
compared to the non-coup baseline. This is also true when take the coup-installed
leaders as the reference, which shows no significant difference among these three
groups of leaders.

Given the superior robustness of the time-dependent model in accounting for
evolving political and economic conditions, the principal interpretation of the
findings rests on this specification. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, and
despite preliminary evidence from simpler models, the manner in which power is
acquired—whether through a coup or autocoup—does not independently predict leader
survival once key contextual variables are incorporated.

Instead, regime type emerges as the most significant predictor of leadership
survival. Leaders in military regimes exhibit a hazard ratio of 3.17 (p \< 0.01),
indicating a $217\%$ higher risk of removal compared to leaders in dominant-party
regimes. Similarly, leaders in personalist regimes (HR = 1.78, p \< 0.01) and in
regimes classified as “Other” (HR = 2.10, p \< 0.05)—including transitional or
provisional arrangements—are also significantly more vulnerable. These results
suggest that institutional fragility, factionalism, and weak legitimacy
associated with such regime types substantially increase the likelihood of
leadership turnover.

Economic conditions also play a noteworthy role. GDP per capita exhibits a
negative and statistically significant relationship with leader removal (HR =
0.96, p \< 0.01), indicating that greater economic development corresponds with
increased political stability. In practical terms, each additional \$10,000 in
GDP per capita reduces the hazard of removal by approximately $4\%$, all else
equal. Furthermore, GDP growth trends are strongly associated with survival (HR =
0.13, p \< 0.01), suggesting that sustained economic performance significantly
enhances leader durability, each 1 point increase of GDP growth ( $1\%$ GDP
growth over the average growth rate for the previous 5 years) reduces the hazard
of removal by approximately $87\%$, all else equal.

Conversely, political violence emerges as a destabilising force. A one-unit
increase in the political violence index raises the hazard of removal by
approximately $6\%$ (HR = 1.06, p \< 0.05), underscoring the impact of societal
unrest and conflict on the sustainability of political leadership.

Other variables, such as population size (log-transformed) and Polity V scores,
do not attain statistical significance in the time-dependent model. While these
measures are often cited as important predictors of regime stability and
institutional quality, their limited explanatory power in this context implies
that more proximate factors—such as regime structure and active conflict—play a
more immediate role in shaping survival outcomes following irregular accessions
to power.

It is important to highlight that these results are conditional upon the
exclusion of leaders who remained in office for fewer than 180 days after their
initial seizure of power. This exclusion is analytically justified, given that
many such short-lived leaders—particularly those emerging from failed coups—do
not manage to consolidate authority and are therefore ill-suited for meaningful
survival analysis. Including these cases could artificially inflate the hazard
ratios for coup-installed leaders, thereby skewing the results.

In sum, this study finds limited support for the hypothesis that autocoup leaders
enjoy greater tenure than their coup-installed counterparts. Instead, it confirms
that broader structural and institutional conditions—especially regime type and
socio-economic context—are the primary determinants of leadership survival
following irregular accessions to power.

@fig-coxHR illustrate the hazard ratios and their associated $95\%$ confidence
intervals for the variables included in the Cox PH model (left figure) and Cox
Time-dependent model (right figure). The proximity of each hazard ratio
(represented by a dot) to 1 denotes minimal effect on the risk of removal from
office; a hazard ratio of 1 indicates no effect. The horizontal lines denote the
$95\%$ confidence intervals, and variables whose intervals cross the vertical
reference line ( dash blue line) at 1 are not statistically significant at the
$5\%$ level. Also, given the superior robustness of the Cox time-dependent model
in accounting for evolving political and economic conditions, the principal
interpretation of the findings rests on the right figure of Cox time-dependent
model.

As previously discussed, the different leaders do not exhibit significant effects
on survival tenure as the intervals lines of "Coup-installed leaders" and
"Autocoup leaders" cross the reference line.

The hazard ratios for leaders in military regimes, personal regimes and "Other"
regimes are substantially above 1 and statistically significant at the $5\%$
level, confirming their heightened vulnerability to removal from office. Other
regime types, mainly the democratic regimes, parliamentary and presidential
democracies, although positive effect, but not significant as the variables cross
the reference line.

GDP growth trend is apparently distant from the reference line, indicating a
significant negative effect of being ousted from office as GDP growth increased.
GDP per capita also attains statistical significance, albeit with a hazard ratio
very close to 1, indicating a relatively modest substantive effect on the risk of
removal. The same is true to the political violence, although statistical
significance, also with a hazard ratio very close to the reference line.

Other variables, including the size of population and Polity scores, display
hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting that marginal changes in these predictors do
not substantially alter the likelihood of political removal for leaders emerging
from coups or autocoups.

#### Assessing the proportional hazards assumption {.unnumbered}

Evaluating the proportional hazards assumption is essential to ensure the
validity of the Cox model estimates. This assumption was tested using a
chi-squared test based on Schoenfeld residuals, which assesses whether the
effects of covariates remain constant over time. The results indicate that
neither the standard Cox PH model nor the time-dependent Cox model violates this
assumption. The global p-values—0.12 for the standard model and 0.23 for the
time-dependent model—exceed the conventional $5\%$ significance threshold,
thereby confirming that the proportional hazards assumption holds in both cases.

### Summary

This chapter has examined the survival durations of political leaders who assumed
office through irregular means—specifically coups and autocoups—by employing
survival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a
time-dependent Cox model. While the standard Cox model indicated a marginally
significant difference in the risk of removal between autocoup and coup-installed
leaders, this association did not attain statistical significance in the
time-dependent model, which offers a more rigorous specification by accounting
for time-varying covariates.

The findings suggest that, once regime type and other pertinent covariates are
controlled for, the method of accession—whether via coup or autocoup—does not
independently determine leader survival. Rather, regime type emerges as a key
determinant. Leaders operating within military or transitional (“other”) regimes
face significantly higher risks of removal than those in dominant-party systems.
Furthermore, economic development, as measured by GDP per capita, and political
violence significantly influence tenure length, whereas GDP growth, population
size, and democratic quality (as captured by Polity V scores) do not exhibit
statistically significant effects.

These results reinforce the central argument that institutional
context—particularly regime characteristics—plays a more decisive role in shaping
political longevity than the initial method of seizing power. This conclusion is
consistent with earlier qualitative assessments and underscores the importance of
integrating institutional and structural variables into analyses of political
survival.

Methodologically, the chapter illustrates the utility of time-dependent modelling
in political science, particularly where covariates evolve over time. It also
contributes to the emerging literature on autocoups by offering one of the first
systematic empirical assessments of their implications for political survival.
However, reliance on a newly constructed dataset for autocoups introduces certain
limitations, underscoring the need for further refinement and expansion in future
research.

In sum, this chapter provides empirical evidence supporting the proposition that
regime characteristics, more than the mode of accession alone, shape the
durability of irregular political leadership. These insights contribute to
broader debates on authoritarian resilience, democratic backsliding, and the
institutional foundations of political authority.

## Coups, Autocoups, and Democracy

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter examines the impact of autocoups on political institutions, drawing
comparisons with conventional coups through an analysis of changes in Polity V
scores. It argues, first, that incumbent leaders often consolidate power by
systematically weakening institutional constraints in the lead-up to an autocoup,
resulting in a decline in Polity scores even prior to the formal event. Second,
in contrast to coups—which exhibit varied outcomes with respect to
democratisation—autocoups almost invariably precipitate democratic backsliding or
the deepening of authoritarian rule. This is because autocoup leaders, in seeking
to extend their tenure beyond constitutionally mandated limits, are explicitly
motivated to dismantle institutional checks and balances.

Utilising a country-fixed effects model and drawing on datasets encompassing both
coups and autocoups, the study demonstrates that Polity scores tend to decline
both before and after an autocoup. In contrast, while coups typically lead to an
immediate deterioration in democratic indicators, they may also create conditions
for partial democratic recovery over time. These findings highlight the distinct
political trajectories engendered by coups and autocoups.

This research addresses a significant lacuna in the empirical study of autocoups
and contributes to scholarly and policy-oriented debates by illuminating their
deleterious effects, particularly in terms of democratic erosion and the
consolidation of authoritarianism.

\newpage

### Introduction

The preceding chapters have defined the concept of an autocoup, introduced a
novel dataset capturing such events, conducted empirical analyses on the
determinants of autocoup attempts, and compared the post-event survival durations
of coup-installed and autocoup leaders. A logical and important extension of this
inquiry concerns the broader implications of autocoups. In particular, from a
political science perspective: how do autocoups affect democratisation processes?

As previously noted, the absence of a comprehensive and widely accepted dataset
on autocoups has meant that most discussions concerning their consequences have
relied primarily on case studies [@baturo; @baturo2022]. To move beyond
case-specific narratives and towards a more systematic and comparative
understanding, this chapter seeks to advance the first empirical investigation
into the democratic consequences of autocoups. The initial objective, therefore,
is to assess whether autocoups serve to entrench authoritarian rule, facilitate
democratisation, or exert no substantive impact on regime type.

Given the conceptual and empirical parallels between coups and autocoups, a
second key aim is to compare their respective effects on democratisation. While
both phenomena disrupt existing political orders, their immediate and longer-term
consequences may diverge significantly. Clarifying these differences is essential
for evaluating their broader political implications.

To address these questions, the study draws upon an established dataset on coups
in conjunction with a newly constructed dataset on autocoups. Employing a
fixed-effects model, it assesses their respective impacts on levels of democracy,
operationalised through the Polity Index. The findings indicate that both coups
and autocoups are associated with an immediate decline in democratic quality.
However, the short-term negative impact of coups is more pronounced. Crucially,
while democracies affected by coups tend to show notable recovery within three
years, those subject to autocoups display no significant improvement during the
same period.

This study makes two principal contributions to the field of political science.
First, it offers the inaugural empirical analysis of the impact of autocoups on
democratisation, thereby addressing a significant gap in the existing literature.
Second, by juxtaposing the effects of coups and autocoups—and demonstrating the
more severe and enduring damage to democratic institutions caused by the
latter—it highlights the necessity of treating autocoups as a distinct political
phenomenon that merits greater scholarly and policy-oriented attention.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 examines the
impact of autocoups on democratisation, with particular reference to their
comparison with traditional coups. Section 3 outlines the research design,
methodological approach, and variables employed. Section 4 presents the empirical
findings and discusses their broader implications. Section 5 concludes by
summarising the key results and considering their significance for understanding
and responding to autocoup dynamics.

### Impact of autocoups on political change

As defined in Chapter 2, an autocoup refers to an incumbent leader extending
their tenure beyond constitutionally mandated limits through extra-constitutional
means. While the title or official position of the leader may change, the
individual in power remains the same. In contrast to traditional coups,
therefore, an autocoup does not result in genuine leadership turnover, elite
restructuring, or regime transformation. The fundamental structure of rule
remains intact.

This distinction bears significant implications. Since regime change seldom
follows an autocoup, its political impact cannot be adequately assessed using
conventional approaches. Typically, studies on coups and democratisation evaluate
outcomes by estimating the likelihood of regime transitions—from autocracy to
democracy or vice versa—as demonstrated in earlier research on the consequences
of coups [@thyne2014; @derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016]. However, this framework
is ill-suited for autocoups, which do not typically induce formal regime
transfers.

The absence of regime change does not, however, imply political stasis. On the
contrary, autocoups invariably alter political dynamics and, in some instances,
may precipitate substantial shifts. Consequently, a more suitable method for
examining their political effects is through the analysis of democracy indices,
such as those provided by the Polity5 dataset [@p1]. The Polity V score—ranging
from -10 (full autocracy) to +10 (full democracy)—captures gradual changes in
regime characteristics, enabling the assessment of more nuanced shifts in
political openness and institutional constraints, even in the absence of formal
regime change. Similar analytical approach has been adopted in prior studies
[@dahl2023].

Although autocoups rarely bring about overt regime transformation, their
implications for democratisation warrant serious consideration. Importantly,
their effects differ from those of traditional coups in at least two key
respects.

#### The pre-event effects versus post-event effects {.unnumbered}

First, unlike coups—typically characterised by sudden, definitive events such as
the removal of a sitting leader—autocoups often unfold incrementally rather than
through a singular, dramatic act. Incumbents intent on extending their rule
generally begin preparing well in advance of the decisive action. This
preparation may involve purging political elites, suppressing opposition parties,
cracking down on dissent and protest, and curtailing media freedom. Without such
pre-emptive measures, an autocoup would likely face robust resistance and, in the
worst case, provoke a backlash that could result in the leader’s rapid removal.

However, once the incumbent has successfully extended their tenure, continued
repression is not always required. On the contrary, some leaders ease political
restrictions in order to placate internal dissent and minimise international
condemnation. This adaptive strategy is aimed at stabilising the post-autocoup
political order.

As a result, the most significant political changes associated with autocoups
often occur prior to the final act itself. Once the autocoup is formalised,
additional changes may be limited. By contrast, coup plotters—who are not
incumbent leaders—lack the institutional power to influence political structures
beforehand. Hence, the political consequences of coups tend to manifest in the
aftermath rather than beforehand.

This distinction is borne out by empirical examples of autocoups.

One of the most frequently cited cases of an autocoup is Peru’s 1992 episode, in
which President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the
1979 Constitution, and governed by decree until November of that year, when a
Democratic Constituent Congress was elected to draft a new constitution
[@cameron1998]. These actions, however, did not immediately result in an
extension of Fujimori’s tenure. Under the provisions of the 1979 Constitution,
immediate presidential re-election was prohibited. To bypass this restriction,
Fujimori initiated a process of constitutional reform, culminating in the
adoption of a new constitution in 1993 that permitted re-election. This
institutional change enabled him to secure a second term in 1995 [@baturo2019].

Peru’s Polity V scores illustrate the political repercussions of these
developments. When Fujimori assumed office in 1990, the score stood at 8 and
remained unchanged in 1991. However, following the dissolution of Congress in
1992, the score declined sharply to -4. Notably, with the adoption of the new
constitution in 1993, the score recovered modestly to -1. This figure remained
constant throughout the remainder of Fujimori’s presidency until his resignation
in 2000, indicating neither further deterioration nor significant recovery in
democratic institutions as reflected in the Polity V index following the
constitutional revision.

A comparable pattern is evident in Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko. Upon
taking office in 1994, Belarus recorded a Polity V score of 8. In 1995, however,
Lukashenko bypassed parliamentary opposition by calling a controversial
referendum and threatening to dissolve the legislature, prompting a drop in the
score to 0. Following the 1996 referendum, which extended his term, the score
fell further to -7, where it has remained ever since—despite two further term
extensions [@ash2014; @baturo].

These cases illustrate a broader trend: the political effects of autocoups are
often manifest before the final stage of the autocoup is executed, whereas the
political consequences of traditional coups emerge predominantly after the event.
This distinction has been explored in depth in previous studies.

Based on this analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Autocoups primarily influence political change in advance of their execution,
whereas coups tend to drive political change predominantly in their aftermath.

***H5-1: Autocoups significantly reduce Polity V scores prior to their execution,
whereas coups primarily decrease Polity V scores immediately following the
event.***

#### Consistent autocoup outcomes versus the varied impact of coups {.unnumbered}

Secondly, in contrast to the ambiguous effects of coups [@dahl2023], autocoups
seldom contribute to democratisation.

The relationship between coups and democratisation has been widely explored in
the existing literature. Some scholars contend that coups—or even the credible
threat thereof—can act as catalysts for democratic transition. One line of
argument posits that coups generate a political "shock" which may create openings
for liberalisation that would otherwise not arise [@thyne2014]. In a critical
reappraisal, @derpanopoulos2016 questioned the presumed democratising effects of
coups, prompting a series of scholarly exchanges with @miller2016. More recently,
@dahl2023 advanced this debate by suggesting that coups may be followed by either
democratic or autocratic transitions, depending in large part on the scale and
character of popular mobilisation.

A frequently cited example of a so-called “pro-democracy coup” occurred in Niger
in February 2010, when military forces removed President Mamadou Tandja after he
had unconstitutionally extended his rule. The Supreme Council for the Restoration
of Democracy (CSRD) assumed power, pledging a return to democratic governance.
Their actions were widely welcomed, both by the domestic opposition and
international observers, as a potential restoration of constitutional rule. In
fulfilment of this commitment, the CSRD organised competitive elections in 2011,
which brought Mahamadou Issoufou to the presidency [@miller2016].

While debate continues over the long-term democratic implications of coups, it is
evident that their outcomes are varied and context-dependent. In contrast,
autocoups almost never facilitate democratic progress, nor do they lead to even
marginal gains in political freedoms. This pattern is attributable to the very
nature of autocoups, which undermine constitutional provisions for leadership
succession—most notably, term limits.

Term limits are institutional mechanisms designed to curtail the monopolisation
of political power. In both democratic and autocratic settings, they serve as
critical safeguards against executive overreach. In democracies, term limits
foster political accountability, leadership renewal, and reduce the risk of
authoritarian backsliding. In autocracies, their enforcement can mitigate
succession crises and offer rare windows for political transition. Conversely,
when term limits are circumvented, political entrenchment becomes more likely, to
the detriment of institutional development and democratic norms.

As outlined in @tbl-autocoup_method in Chapter 2, autocoups are executed through
either pseudo-legal reforms or overtly unconstitutional means. These include
amending or disregarding term limits, postponing or annulling elections,
manipulating electoral outcomes, or refusing to accept adverse results. Although
many autocoups retain a façade of legality, they are fundamentally characterised
by their breach of constitutional constraints intended to prevent indefinite
rule.

As discussed earlier, incumbent leaders often engage in institutional weakening
well before they formally extend their tenure. Moreover, once entrenched, they
seldom reverse repressive measures or meaningfully restore democratic freedoms,
even if political pressures are temporarily relaxed.

Case studies from Peru and Belarus underscore the tendency of autocoups to
precipitate declines in Polity scores, indicative of democratic erosion. However,
it is important to note that most autocoups (two thirds) occur in regimes that
are already authoritarian, where Polity scores are already low. This pattern
mirrors broader trends observed in the coup literature, where coups
disproportionately occur in autocratic contexts.

For example, in China’s 2018 constitutional amendment, President Xi Jinping
abolished presidential term limits, thereby allowing indefinite tenure[^2].
Nonetheless, China’s Polity score remained constant at -7, both before and after
the amendment. This reflects the broader tendency in highly autocratic regimes
(Polity scores below -6), where minimal democratic institutions exist and little
further decline is statistically possible.

While most autocoups occur in low-scoring regimes, some have been recorded in
relatively more democratic systems where the Polity score remained stable despite
term limit circumvention. This is particularly evident in Latin America, where
several presidents have amended “no immediate re-election” provisions to allow a
second consecutive term, but later relinquished power voluntarily. Examples
include Argentina (1993), where the Polity score remained at 7; Brazil (1997),
where it held at 8; and Colombia (2004), where it stayed at 7. In these
instances, term extensions were achieved within a functioning institutional
framework, without further undermining democratic structures [@baturo2019].

Across all cases mentioned above—whether in Peru, Belarus, China, Argentina,
Brazil, or Colombia—there is no instance in which the Polity score increased
following an autocoup. Within the autocoup dataset introduced in Chapter 3, only
four cases—Guinea-Bissau (1988), Burkina Faso (1997), Congo-Brazzaville (2001),
and Lebanon (2004)—exhibited slight increases in Polity scores, but these changes
were negligible.

Unlike some coup leaders who claim democratic intent—as in Niger’s 2010
example—autocoup leaders seldom, if ever, articulate such justifications. If the
advancement of democracy were truly their objective, they would relinquish power
in accordance with constitutional limits rather than dismantle them.

Based on this analysis, the second hypothesis is proposed:

Autocoups typically result in a decline in the Polity Index and rarely see
democratic recovery, whereas coups often allow for recovery and may even
facilitate transitions from autocracy to democracy.

***H5-2: Autocoups significantly reduce Polity V scores with minimal democratic
recovery, whereas coups often allow recovery and sometimes improving democratic
conditions.***

### Methodology and variables

#### Methodology {.unnumbered}

As previously discussed, autocoups are less likely to result in full regime
transitions—whether from democracy to autocracy or vice versa. Consequently, it
is inappropriate to evaluate their effects solely in terms of regime shifts or
changes that surpass critical thresholds. Instead, this study assesses political
change through variations in Polity V scores.

In contrast to conventional analyses of coups, which primarily focus on
post-event consequences, this study examines both pre- and post-event effects of
autocoups. Specifically, the pre-event impact is measured by the change in Polity
V scores over the two-year period preceding the autocoup, calculated as:

$$
Polity_{t-1} - Polity_{t-3}
$$

Similarly, the post-event effect is measured by the change in Polity V scores
over the three years following the autocoup, expressed as:

$$
Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t
$$

A three-year time frame is adopted for two principal reasons. First, political
changes preceding an autocoup generally occur incrementally, as incumbents
gradually consolidate power rather than taking abrupt action. Second, post-event
analysis is designed to capture medium-term developments rather than immediate
shocks, as autocoups rarely produce rapid regime transitions. Instead, they
typically serve to reinforce existing political structures. Short-term
fluctuations, therefore, may be insufficient to reflect meaningful institutional
transformation.

To estimate how political institutions evolve before and after autocoups, a
linear model with country-case fixed effects is employed. For the analysis of
pre-event effects, all attempted autocoups are included, on the grounds that
prior to the event, it is unknown whether the attempt will succeed or fail.

Conversely, the analysis of post-event effects is restricted to successful
autocoups, for three main reasons. First, the vast majority of autocoups are
successful (64 out of 83 cases). Second, failed autocoups tend to produce
immediate political disturbances rather than sustained medium- or long-term
consequences. Third, failed attempts are frequently followed by significant
disruptive events—such as coups, uprisings, or mass protests—which complicate
efforts to isolate the effects of the autocoup itself. For example, in Niger, a
failed autocoup in 2009 was swiftly followed by a coup in 2010, thereby
entangling the political consequences of both episodes. In contrast, successful
autocoups offer a more coherent analytical framework, as their effects are less
likely to be confounded by subsequent disruptions, thus allowing for a more
systematic evaluation of institutional change.

#### Variables {.unnumbered}

This study utilises a global sample of all country-year data from 1950 to 2020,
employing a linear model to examine the effects of autocoups on political change.
The dependent variable is the change in Polity scores, while the principal
independent variable is the occurrence of an autocoup. The dataset comprises
approximately 9,100 observations.

The dependent variable captures political change through two-year or three-year
differences in Polity scores. Specifically, Model 1 (pre-event effects) is
specified as: $Polity_{t-1} − Polity_{t − 3}$. Model 2 (post-event effects) is
defined as: $Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t$.

Polity scores range from -10 (full autocracy) to +10 (full democracy). Certain
values within the dataset—namely -66, -77, and -88—represent transitional regimes
or periods of political uncertainty. To minimise data loss, these values are
replaced with the closest valid Polity scores, thereby ensuring the analysis
captures continuous changes in institutional quality rather than focusing
exclusively on transitions that cross democratic thresholds.

The primary independent variable is the autocoup, as defined in Chapter 2. The
dataset includes 83 attempted autocoups (used in the pre-event analysis) and 64
successful autocoups (used in the post-event analysis). For pre-event analysis,
the autocoup variable is binary, coded as 1 if an attempted autocoup occurred and
0 otherwise.

In the post-event analysis, a decay function is applied to capture both immediate
and delayed effects, following the approach of @dahl2023. To assess the
persistence of autocoup impacts, a half-life specification of five years is
adopted, evaluating effects from the year of the autocoup ( $y_t$ ) through to
four years after ( $y_{t+4}$ ).

Traditional coups are also included as a secondary independent variable for two
main reasons. First, for comparative significance: a robust empirical comparison
requires assessing whether autocoups differ meaningfully from coups in their
political consequences. Second, due to overlapping events: autocoups and coups
often occur in close proximity or causal sequence, making it necessary to
distinguish their respective effects. The coup dataset employed is drawn from
@powell2011. To ensure consistency, the same methodological framework used for
autocoups is applied to coups—binary coding for pre-event effects and decay
function coding for post-event effects.

Control variables include economic performance, political violence, and
population size, all of which have been examined in previous chapters. Two
additional dummy variables are incorporated. The first, 'non_democracy', accounts
for regime type: countries with Polity scores below -6 are already autocratic and
thus less susceptible to further decline, while those above 6 are more resilient
to deterioration. The second, 'cold_war', reflects temporal context, following
prior research on the effects of coups on democratisation [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023]. This variable captures broader geopolitical
trends, notably the general decline in Polity scores during the Cold War
(1960s–1990), followed by a tendency towards democratisation after 1990.

### Results and discussion

#### Pre-event effects {.unnumbered}

This section begins by analysing the trajectory of Polity scores in the lead-up
to autocoup events. As shown in Models 1 to 4 in @tbl-demomodel, Column 1
presents the empirical results for pre-event effects, focusing on changes
observed over the two-year period preceding the event. Consistent with the first
hypothesis, Polity V scores demonstrate a statistically significant decline in
the two years prior to an autocoup. Notably, traditional coups exhibit no
statistically significant effects on Polity V scores in the period preceding the
events.

Model 1 specifically examines the change in Polity V scores between year $t−3$
(three years before the event) and year $t−1$ (the year immediately preceding the
event), expressed as $Polity_{t−1} - Polity_{t−3}$ . The results indicate a
statistically significant average decline of 0.67 points in Polity scores during
this period prior to an autocoup, after controlling for other variables. By
contrast, the analysis reveals no significant change in Polity scores prior to
traditional coups, suggesting that the periods leading up to such coups do not
exert a measurable influence on levels of democratisation.

#### Event-year effects {.unnumbered}

Model 2 evaluates the immediate impact by comparing Polity scores in the year of
the autocoup or coup with those of the preceding year, calculated as
$Polity_{t} - Polity_{t-1}$. As previously noted, the year in which an autocoup
or coup occurs typically registers a substantial disruption to political
institutions. Accordingly, both types of events are associated with a notable
decline in Polity scores relative to the prior year.

The magnitude of the negative effect is comparable across both event types: on
average, Polity scores decrease by 1.3 points following either an autocoup or a
coup, holding other variables constant. These findings suggest that, although
autocoups have received less scholarly and public attention than coups, they
nonetheless exert similarly significant immediate effects on institutional
democratic quality as measured by the Polity index.

#### Mid-term effects: comparing attempted and successful autocoups {.unnumbered}

Models 3 and 4 present the empirical findings on the mid-term effects of
autocoups, assessing changes in Polity scores three years after the events. These
effects are measured as $Polity_{t+3} - Polity_{t}$​, with Model 3 focusing on
attempted autocoups and Model 4 on successful ones.

Model 3 evaluates the impact of attempted autocoups. The analysis reveals no
statistically significant change in Polity scores following such attempts. This
finding contrasts with attempted coups, which are associated with an average
increase of 1.2 points in Polity scores over the same period, controlling for
other variables.

Model 4 considers the consequences of successful autocoups. Similar to attempted
autocoups, the results do not indicate any statistically significant changes in
Polity scores three years after the event. In contrast, successful coups are
linked to a positive trajectory in democratisation, with an average increase of
1.87 points in Polity scores within three years, all else being equal.

These findings offer several important insights. First, neither attempted nor
successful autocoups produce discernible changes in Polity scores over the
mid-term. This suggests that the effects of autocoups are primarily front-loaded,
exerting their influence in the lead-up to the event rather than in its
aftermath. Coups, by contrast, tend to generate significant post-event dynamics.

Second, autocoups generally have a negative and unidirectional impact on
democratic institutions, primarily eroding democratic quality before the event
without subsequent recovery. In contrast, coups exhibit a more complex temporal
pattern: they often trigger an immediate shock and decline in democratic
indicators, but this is frequently followed by recovery—or even
overshooting—where the democracy index not only returns to its pre-coup level but
may surpass it within two to three years.

#### Effects of control variables {.unnumbered}

To ensure the robustness of the empirical findings, the models incorporate a
range of control variables. While economic trends, political violence, and the
Cold War (which is only statistically significant in the event year) do not
exhibit consistent or significant effects on Polity scores, several other
variables merit further discussion.

The effects of GDP per capita, population size, and regime type reveal a more
nuanced pattern. Counterintuitively, higher levels of GDP per capita are
associated with lower Polity scores, whereas non-democratic regimes and larger
populations are linked to positive changes in Polity scores. This seemingly
paradoxical result can be understood by considering the baseline differences
between democratic and non-democratic regimes.

In established democracies, Polity scores are already close to the upper end of
the scale, leaving limited scope for further increases. These states also tend to
exhibit higher GDP per capita and lower population growth rates, factors that are
typically associated with political and institutional stability. As a result,
their Polity scores tend to remain stable over time.

By contrast, non-democratic regimes begin from a lower baseline in the Polity
index, thus allowing for greater potential improvement. These regimes often
experience weaker economic performance and more rapid population growth, but may
also be more likely to undergo political liberalisation or reform, contributing
to upward shifts in Polity scores.

Taken together, these findings lend empirical support to both core hypotheses.
First, the principal effects of autocoups on Polity scores materialise prior to
the events themselves. Second, while the consequences of coups for
democratisation are mixed and context-dependent, the impact of autocoups is both
consistent and unidirectional—uniformly negative.

#### Robustness tests {.unnumbered}

To evaluate the sensitivity of the main findings to alternative model
specifications, I conduct a series of robustness tests. The results indicate that
the core conclusions remain stable across these variations.

First, I assess the effects of autocoups over a period ranging from one to five
years following the event. The analysis, as shown in Models 5 to 9 in
@tbl-demomodel1, reveals that the effects of coups remain positive and
statistically significant throughout the five-year period, with a general trend
of increasing magnitude over time. In contrast, the effects of autocoups remain
negative across all five years but do not attain statistical significance at any
point. This finding corroborates the earlier hypothesis that autocoups do not
lead to increases in Polity scores.

Subsequently, I refine the operationalisation of the autocoup variable by
replacing the decay function with a binary indicator distinguishing between
attempted and successful autocoups. Additionally, I disaggregate the
'non-democracy' category into more specific regime types—namely dominant-party,
military, personalist, presidential, parliamentary, and "other" regimes—in line
with the autocoup determinants analysis, using dominant-party as the reference
category. The results of these models are presented Models 10 to 13 in
@tbl-demomodel2.

Models 10 and 11 in @tbl-demomodel2 assess the effects of attempted autocoups,
measured two and three years after the event, respectively, while Models 12 and
13 focus on successful autocoups. As with the primary models, these
specifications do not alter the main findings: autocoups continue to exhibit no
statistically significant effects on Polity scores two or three years post-event,
whereas coups consistently produce positive and statistically significant
increases in the same periods. The control variables GDP per capita and
population size likewise yield results consistent with the baseline models.

However, political violence and regime type display differing effects depending
on the time horizon. Political violence exhibits marginal statistical
significance in the three-year post-event models (Models 11 and 13) but not in
the two-year models (Models 10 and 12) . Although modest in magnitude, a
one-point increase in the political violence index is associated with a 0.045
increase in the Polity score after three years.

Among the disaggregated regime types, military regimes consistently correlate
with declines in Polity scores, though statistical significance emerges only in
the three-year period and does not differ between attempted and successful
events. Personalist and “other” regimes demonstrate consistent and statistically
significant effects across all four models, albeit in opposite directions:
personalist regimes are associated with negative effects, while “other” regimes
(typically transitional or provisional regimes) show positive effects. This
suggests that transitional regimes frequently move towards greater levels of
democracy. Finally, both presidential and parliamentary democracies display
positive and statistically significant effects in the three-year models, though
not in the two-year models.

### Summary

This chapter investigates the impact of autocoups on political
institutions—particularly in comparison to coups—by analysing their effects on
changes in Polity V scores. It tests two central hypotheses. First, that unlike
coups, the effects of autocoups on Polity scores primarily manifest prior to the
event, suggesting that leaders consolidate power in anticipation of executing an
autocoup. Second, whereas coups tend to produce a "U-shaped" effect—marked by an
initial decline in Polity scores followed by a recovery to prior levels or
beyond—autocoups are consistently associated with sustained declines, indicating
democratic backsliding or authoritarian entrenchment.

To evaluate these hypotheses, the chapter conducts a series of robustness checks,
including variations in the time horizon, alternative model specifications, and
different variable operationalisations. The core finding is that these
alternative models yield results consistent with the main analysis.

The implications of these findings are significant for both academic scholarship
and policy-making. While coups have traditionally received considerable attention
in studies of democratisation, this chapter contends that autocoups merit
equal—if not greater—focus due to their systematic role in reversing democratic
progress. Unlike coups, which may occasionally serve as catalysts for reform and
transitions from autocracy to democracy, autocoups almost invariably consolidate
authoritarian rule, weaken political institutions, and erode democratic
governance. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Chapter 4, leaders who carry out
autocoups tend to remain in power for nearly ten years on average, compared to
less than seven years for coup-installed leaders. This suggests that the
detrimental effects of autocoups may be more enduring than those of coups.

This chapter also makes a methodological contribution to the study of democratic
processes by highlighting the importance of pre-event dynamics in analysing the
effects of political shocks. Previous research has largely concentrated on
post-event consequences; by contrast, this chapter demonstrates that significant
political changes can precede events such as autocoups.

Nevertheless, certain limitations remain that future research should address.
Coups and autocoups sometimes occur in close succession—either in the same year
or within a short interval—which complicates efforts to isolate their respective
impacts on Polity scores. Disentangling these overlapping effects remains a
methodological challenge and represents a valuable avenue for future inquiry.

In conclusion, this chapter strengthens the argument that autocoups represent a
critical yet under-explored mechanism of democratic backsliding. As such, they
warrant further investigation to better understand their implications for global
patterns of democratisation and authoritarian resilience.

## Conclusion

This study has systematically compared coups and autocoups, two distinct forms of
irregular leadership transitions, to deepen our understanding of how power
dynamics shape leadership change, survival, and their impact on political
institutions. Through conceptual refinement, the construction of a novel dataset,
and multi-faceted empirical analysis, this thesis has shed light on the
similarities and differences between coups and autocoups in terms of their
drivers, the fate of leaders, and their democratic consequences.

### Main findings

A central contribution of this research lies in the incorporation of autocoups—an
often overlooked phenomenon—into the analytical framework of irregular transfers
of power. Based on this framework, the study yields the following principal
findings:

First, in terms of conceptualisation and empirical grounding, this study
addresses the prevailing conceptual fragmentation marked by the proliferation of
overlapping and inconsistently applied terms such as self-coup, autogolpe, and
executive aggrandisement, alongside a dearth of systematic data
[@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. To resolve this, **Chapter 2** proposes a
more analytically rigorous definition of an autocoup: the act of an incumbent
leader extending their constitutionally mandated term through
extra-constitutional means. Building upon this definition, this chapter
introduces and makes publicly available the first global dataset on autocoup
events, encompassing 83 attempted (64 successful) cases from 1945 to 2023. This
provides a robust empirical foundation for future quantitative analyses.

Second, to address the paucity of large-N empirical studies on the determinants
of autocoup attempts, **Chapter 3** presents pioneering research which finds that
regime type significantly affects the likelihood of autocoup occurrence. In
contrast to traditional coups—which typically emerge in unstable or fragmented
political systems such as military regimes [@powell2012; @frantz2017;
@powell2018; @thyne2019; @kim2021]—autocoups are more prevalent in regimes
characterised by concentrated and relatively stable executive power. The
empirical analysis demonstrates that presidential democracies and personalist
authoritarian regimes are significantly more susceptible to autocoup attempts
than dominant-party regimes. This pattern reflects the fragility of institutional
constraints and the centralisation of authority in such systems.

Third, although leadership survival has been extensively examined in the
literature [@buenodemesquita2003; @svolik2014; @frantz2016; @sudduth2018;
@davenport2021], few studies have focused on post-autocoup leader survival.
**Chapter 4** addresses this gap by investigating tenure differences between
coup-installed and autocoup leaders. While preliminary analysis suggested that
autocoup leaders tend to remain in office longer, a time-dependent Cox
proportional hazards model—controlling for key covariates such as regime
type—found no statistically significant difference in the risk of removal based
solely on the method of power acquisition. Rather, regime characteristics emerged
as the critical determinant of leadership survival: leaders in military and
transitional regimes face a significantly higher risk of removal than their
counterparts in dominant-party regimes. These findings suggest that the
durability of irregular leadership depends more on institutional context than on
the particular mode of power seizure.

Finally, whereas the existing literature has predominantly examined the effects
of coups on democratic outcomes [@thyne2014; @derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016;
@dahl2023a], **Chapter 5** undertakes a novel analysis of the democratic
consequences of autocoups. The findings reveal that autocoups differ markedly
from traditional coups in their democratic impact. Specifically, autocoups are
frequently preceded by a gradual erosion of democratic institutions (pre-event
effects) and are consistently associated with sustained democratic backsliding or
the consolidation of authoritarian rule (post-event effects). In contrast, while
traditional coups often cause an immediate decline in democratic indicators, they
may, in some cases, facilitate conditions conducive to democratic recovery or
transition. This underscores the uniquely detrimental and enduring role that
autocoups play in undermining democratic governance.

### Policy implications

The findings of this study not only enhance academic understanding of irregular
transfers of power but also offer significant insights for policy-makers,
particularly in addressing global democratic backsliding and reinforcing the
resilience of political institutions.

First, the importance of institutional design is underscored. **Chapter 3**
demonstrates that regimes characterised by highly centralised executive authority
are more vulnerable to autocoups, echoing earlier scholarship that highlights the
pivotal role of regime type and institutional architecture [@geddes1999a;
@frantz2017a]. Strengthening mechanisms of horizontal accountability—such as
independent legislatures, judiciaries, and oversight bodies—is thus essential for
limiting executive overreach and preventing incumbents from circumventing
constitutional constraints. Key institutional safeguards include robust and
enforceable term limits, a vibrant and empowered civil society, and codified,
transparent procedures for political succession. These components are critical in
constructing institutional bulwarks against autocoups and the entrenchment of
authoritarian rule.

Second, international and regional responses must become more nuanced and
proactive. While the global community has developed relatively standardised
mechanisms for addressing military coups, **Chapters 4 and 5** highlight that
autocoups often unfold more subtly and incrementally. Consequently, international
and regional organisations—such as the African Union (AU), the Organisation of
American States (OAS), and the European Union (EU)—must adopt a more vigilant
posture [@wobig2014; @shannon2014; @thyne2017]. Beyond condemning and sanctioning
overt military takeovers, these bodies should exert sustained diplomatic and
economic pressure against attempts to subvert constitutional term limits through
formal amendments, manipulated electoral processes, or other means that undermine
democratic integrity. In doing so, they can play a more active role in upholding
democratic norms and deterring executive aggrandisement.

Finally, as **Chapter 5** illustrates, the use of gradual and incremental
monitoring tools—such as Polity scores—warrants greater attention [@dahl2023a].
Autocoups lack the abrupt and visible character of military coups; instead, they
often proceed under the guise of legality and institutional continuity, making
them more difficult to detect and counter in real time. Accordingly,
policy-makers, scholars, and civil society actors should prioritise the
systematic observation of democratic indicators, including nuanced shifts in
Polity scores, Freedom House ratings, and V-Dem indices. This form of monitoring
is essential for identifying early warning signs of executive overreach and the
gradual erosion of democratic safeguards, thereby enabling the timely
implementation of preventative interventions.

### Limitations and directions for future research

While this study has made progress in the conceptualization, data, and empirical
analysis of irregular leadership transitions, it also has limitations that
suggest avenues for future research.

Firstly, there is still room for refinement of concepts and datasets. The concept
of autocoup proposed in **Chapter 2** and the dataset constructed are
preliminary; further discussion and consensus within the academic community are
needed to refine the boundaries of autocoups. Specifically, how to handle
"borderline cases" where term limits are circumvented through legal or
quasi-legal means requires more detailed coding rules and judgement criteria.
Future research can further refine the autocoup dataset by adding cases and
cross-validating with existing datasets.

Secondly, methodological challenges need to be addressed. In analysing the
determinants of autocoup attempts, **Chapter 3** treated autocoup attempts as a
binary outcome. However, autocoups can be a continuous process, and leaders may
make multiple attempts. Future research could explore more refined time-series
analysis methods to capture the dynamics and sequencing of autocoup behaviour.
Furthermore, coups and autocoups are sometimes closely linked, and effectively
isolating their respective impacts remains a persistent methodological challenge.

Thirdly, expanding the scope of research is important. This study primarily
focused on term extension as a specific form of executive power expansion, but
leadership power expansion also includes other forms that do not involve overt
term extension (e.g., weakening the legislature, controlling the judiciary)
[@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. These forms of power expansion themselves
impact institutional resilience and democratic quality and may be related to
attempts at term prolongation. Future research could attempt to construct a more
comprehensive dataset on executive power expansion and integrate it into the
analytical framework to more fully understand the mechanisms of authoritarian
consolidation and democratic backsliding.

Through the comparative analysis of coups and autocoups, this study has enhanced
our understanding of the complexities of irregular power transfers. Autocoups, as
a distinct strategy of authoritarian consolidation, with their gradual, hidden
nature and continuous erosion of democratic institutions, represent a significant
challenge to contemporary global democracy. This research provides an empirical
foundation for understanding the drivers and consequences of autocoups and aims
to stimulate further research to collectively address this important political
phenomenon. Through continued conceptual clarification, data accumulation, and
mechanism exploration, we can better understand the resilience of
authoritarianism, the fragility of democratic institutions, and the complex
pathways of political change.
