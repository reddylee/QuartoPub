As a Ph.D. student specializing in political science, my focus is on democratization, with a particular interest in coups.
Here, you'll find a collection of my work, where I employ various methodologies such as experiments, surveys, and observational data analysis.
Currently, I'm engaged in a project exploring coups, self-coups, and survival analyses of political leaders of successful coups or self-coups.
Explore my research to delve deeper into these fascinating topics.
