## Continuismo

**Continuismo** is a term used to describe the practice of political leaders
extending their time in office beyond the limits initially set by the
constitution or by law. This can occur through various methods, including
constitutional amendments, referendums, manipulation of the electoral process, or
other legal and extralegal maneuvers that allow the incumbent to remain in power.

The term is often associated with Latin American politics, where it has been used
to describe the actions of leaders who, after coming to power, seek to stay in
office indefinitely or for prolonged periods, bypassing or altering the legal
restrictions on their terms. This practice undermines democratic principles and
can lead to authoritarianism, as it typically involves eroding checks and
balances, concentrating power in the hands of the leader, and weakening
democratic institutions.

**Examples of Continuismo**: - **Hugo Chávez in Venezuela**: Chávez pushed for
constitutional changes that allowed him to extend his presidency. - **Daniel
Ortega in Nicaragua**: Ortega has been in power for many years, having changed
the constitution to remove term limits. - **Evo Morales in Bolivia**: Morales
sought to extend his presidency through referendums and legal challenges to term
limits.

**Key Characteristics of Continuismo**: 1. **Constitutional Manipulation**:
Changing the constitution to remove or extend term limits. 2. **Referendums and
Plebiscites**: Using popular votes to legitimize the extension of terms. 3.
**Electoral Manipulation**: Rigging elections or suppressing opposition to
maintain power. 4. **Judicial Influence**: Controlling the judiciary to obtain
favorable rulings that allow term extensions. 5. **Political Coercion**: Using
state resources and power to intimidate or eliminate opposition.

**Impact of Continuismo**: - **Democratic Backsliding**: Erosion of democratic
norms and institutions. - **Authoritarianism**: Concentration of power in the
hands of a single leader. - **Political Instability**: Potential for increased
unrest and conflict as opposition groups resist power extensions. - **Loss of
Public Trust**: Diminished faith in democratic processes and institutions.
