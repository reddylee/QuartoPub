## Continuismo

**Continuismo** is a term used to describe the practice of political leaders
extending their time in office beyond the limits initially set by the
constitution or by law. This can occur through various methods, including
constitutional amendments, referendums, manipulation of the electoral process, or
other legal and extralegal maneuvers that allow the incumbent to remain in power.

The term is often associated with Latin American politics, where it has been used
to describe the actions of leaders who, after coming to power, seek to stay in
office indefinitely or for prolonged periods, bypassing or altering the legal
restrictions on their terms. This practice undermines democratic principles and
can lead to authoritarianism, as it typically involves eroding checks and
balances, concentrating power in the hands of the leader, and weakening
democratic institutions.

**Examples of Continuismo**: - **Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela**: Ch√°vez pushed for
constitutional changes that allowed him to extend his presidency. - **Daniel
Ortega in Nicaragua**: Ortega has been in power for many years, having changed
the constitution to remove term limits. - **Evo Morales in Bolivia**: Morales
sought to extend his presidency through referendums and legal challenges to term
limits.

**Key Characteristics of Continuismo**: 1. **Constitutional Manipulation**:
Changing the constitution to remove or extend term limits. 2. **Referendums and
Plebiscites**: Using popular votes to legitimize the extension of terms. 3.
**Electoral Manipulation**: Rigging elections or suppressing opposition to
maintain power. 4. **Judicial Influence**: Controlling the judiciary to obtain
favorable rulings that allow term extensions. 5. **Political Coercion**: Using
state resources and power to intimidate or eliminate opposition.

**Impact of Continuismo**: - **Democratic Backsliding**: Erosion of democratic
norms and institutions. - **Authoritarianism**: Concentration of power in the
hands of a single leader. - **Political Instability**: Potential for increased
unrest and conflict as opposition groups resist power extensions. - **Loss of
Public Trust**: Diminished faith in democratic processes and institutions.

## Interpreting the regression output

The regression results from the sample selection model provide insights into the
factors influencing coup attempts and their outcomes between 1950 and 2019. The
model uses a double probit approach with sample selection to address potential
biases in analyzing coup attempts and outcomes.

### Interpretation of Regression Results

#### Coup Attempts (Column 1)

-   **Constant**: The negative constant (-0.549) suggests a lower baseline
    likelihood of coup attempts when all other variables are at their reference
    points.
-   **Regime Types**:
    -   **Democracy**: The coefficient (0.041) is not statistically significant,
        indicating that being a democracy does not have a significant impact on
        the likelihood of a coup attempt compared to the reference regime type.
    -   **Military**: The positive and significant coefficient (0.370) indicates
        that military regimes are more likely to experience coup attempts.
    -   **Monarchy**: The positive and significant coefficient (0.288) suggests
        that monarchies are also more prone to coup attempts.
    -   **Personalist**: The coefficient (0.160) is positive and significant,
        showing that personalist regimes have a higher likelihood of coup
        attempts.
-   **Economic Trend**: The significant negative coefficient (-1.383) suggests
    that a positive economic trend decreases the likelihood of coup attempts.
-   **GDP per Capita**: The negative and significant coefficient (-0.021)
    indicates that higher GDP per capita reduces the probability of coup
    attempts.
-   **Political Violence**: The positive and significant coefficient (0.033)
    suggests that higher levels of political violence increase the likelihood of
    coup attempts.
-   **Coup Experience**: The large and significant positive coefficient (0.722)
    implies that countries with previous coup experience are much more likely to
    have another coup attempt.
-   **Years Since Last Coup**: The negative and significant coefficient (-0.030)
    indicates that as more time passes since the last coup, the likelihood of
    another coup attempt decreases.

#### Coup Outcomes (Column 2)

-   **Constant**: The negative constant (-1.522) suggests a lower baseline
    likelihood of successful coup outcomes when all other variables are at their
    reference points.
-   **Regime Types**:
    -   **Democracy, Military, Monarchy, Personalist**: None of these regime
        types have significant coefficients, implying that these variables do not
        significantly affect the success of coups.
-   **Economic Trend**: The positive coefficient (0.763) is not statistically
    significant, suggesting no significant impact on coup success.
-   **GDP per Capita**: The negative coefficient (-0.019) is weakly significant
    (p\<0.1), indicating a marginal decrease in coup success with higher GDP per
    capita.
-   **Political Violence**: The positive coefficient (0.024) is not statistically
    significant, indicating no significant impact on coup success.
-   **ùúå (Rho)**: The significant coefficient (0.436) indicates the correlation
    between the error terms of the selection and outcome equations, suggesting
    that the double probit model with sample selection is appropriate.

### Analysis of Double Probit Model with Sample Selection

The use of a double probit model with sample selection is appropriate for the
following reasons:

1.  **Addressing Selection Bias**: Coup data is prone to selection bias because
    we only observe successful coups and attempted coups, not potential coups
    that were never attempted. The sample selection model accounts for this bias
    by modeling both the selection process (coup attempts) and the outcome (coup
    success).
2.  **Significant Correlation (ùúå)**: The significant correlation between the
    error terms of the selection and outcome equations indicates that unobserved
    factors affecting coup attempts also influence coup outcomes, justifying the
    use of the sample selection model.
3.  **Different Influences on Attempts and Outcomes**: The results show that
    factors influencing coup attempts (e.g., regime type, economic conditions,
    political violence) differ from those influencing coup outcomes. This
    differentiation supports the need for a model that separately analyzes the
    decision to attempt a coup and the likelihood of its success.

### Conclusion

The double probit model with sample selection effectively addresses selection
bias and provides a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing both coup
attempts and their outcomes. The results highlight the importance of regime type,
economic conditions, and political violence in the likelihood of coup attempts,
while showing that these factors do not significantly affect the success of
coups. This approach allows for a more accurate analysis of the dynamics
surrounding coups and their determinants.
