```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stargazer)
```

```{r}
#| results: 'asis'
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
stargazer(model, type = "latex",
          header = F,
          out.header = F,
          title = "Regression model of cars",
          label = "tblcars")
```

We can see the regression model in Table @tblcars.
