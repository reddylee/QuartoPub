## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of irregular leadership
transitions, with a particular focus on coups and autocoups. It examines the
underlying determinants of these events, evaluates their implications for leader
survival, and assesses their broader impacts on political stability and
democratic institutions.

The central argument advanced is that power dynamics serve as the primary driver
behind the occurrence of both coups and autocoups, influencing not only their
likelihood but also their consequences for post-event governance and
institutional integrity. The first part of the study explores the conditions
under which traditional coups occur, emphasizing the strategic balance between
incumbent leaders and potential coup plotters. Using a double probit model with
sample selection, the analysis finds that the perceived probability of success,
which determined by power balance, strongly predicts coup attempts. Furthermore,
the findings indicate that, all else equal, military regimes are 277.7% more
likely and personalist regimes 94% more likely to experience coups compared to
dominant-party regimes.

The second part turns to autocoups—a relatively understudied form of irregular
transition wherein incumbents overstay their constitutionally mandated tenure.
The thesis introduces a refined definition of autocoups and presents a new
dataset spanning from 1945 to 2023. Through empirical analysis and case studies,
this section demonstrates how the revised definition and dataset enable more
meaningful comparisons between coups and autocoups.

Subsequently, a survival analysis is employed to compare the tenures of leaders
who came to power via coups versus those who extended their rule through
autocoups. The findings reveal that coup-installed leaders are 2.23 times more
likely to be ousted than autocoup leaders. Put differently, post-event tenures of
autocoup leaders are, on average, five years longer than those of coup-installed
leaders.

Finally, the thesis evaluates the impact of these irregular transitions on
democratization, using Polity scores as a measure. A country-fixed effects model
shows that autocoups are associated with a steady decline in Polity scores both
before and after their occurrence, while coups typically cause an immediate drop
followed by partial recovery over time.

These findings highlight the distinct political trajectories resulting from coups
and autocoups. The research fills a critical gap in the empirical study of
autocoups and raises important concerns about their long-term consequences,
including democratic backsliding and the entrenchment of authoritarianism.

Overall, this study contributes to the field of political science by providing a
clearer conceptualization of autocoups, introducing a novel dataset, and offering
robust comparative analyses of leadership survival and institutional outcomes.
The implications are significant for both academic scholarship and policy-making
aimed at strengthening democratic resilience.

## Introduction

At the heart of contemporary political dynamics lies a fundamental question: Why
do some political leaders face premature removal from power, while others manage
to extend their tenure beyond constitutional limits? Furthermore, how does the
manner of their survival or ouster impact political stability and the integrity
of constitutional institutions? This research seeks to address these critical
issues.

The stability and resilience of any political system heavily depend on smooth and
orderly leadership transitions. When successions occur within established
institutional norms, they reinforce the legitimacy and durability of the
political structure. Conversely, the breakdown of conventional leadership
transfer mechanisms often precipitates social unrest, political violence, and
institutional decay. Irregular leadership transitions, in particular, can cast
long shadows, profoundly affecting democratic processes, regime stability, and
the broader political order. Consequently, understanding the drivers and
consequences of such events remains a central preoccupation within political
science.

Extant literature explores numerous factors triggering irregular leader
transitions, including civil wars [@kokkonen2019], international conflict
[@demesquita1995], ethnic dynamics [@londregan1995], economic performance
[@miller2012; @krishnarajan2019], and natural disasters [@quirozflores2012].
However, among these diverse triggers, coups d'état stand out as arguably the
most significant driving force behind irregular leadership change. This
prominence stems from both their high frequency and their direct outcome: the
ousting of incumbent leaders. Indeed, research indicates that in autocracies,
coups account for approximately one-third of all leader exits—a higher proportion
than regular transitions (slightly over one-fifth) [@frantz2016]. Furthermore,
among non-constitutional exits in dictatorships, over 63% result from coups
[@svolik2009].

Given their impact, coups have attracted considerable scholarly attention. A
large body of literature analyses their determinants, immediate outcomes, and
broader effects on democracy and economic development, as summarized by
@thyne2019. Correspondingly, sophisticated datasets on coups have been developed
[@powell2011]. Despite this extensive research, critical gaps remain, motivating
the present study.

### Motivations

This thesis is driven by two primary limitations in the existing scholarship.

First, despite numerous studies dedicated to understanding the causes of coups,
significant model uncertainty persists. Approximately one hundred potential
determinants have been proposed, yet no consensus has emerged on a baseline model
for coup analysis [@gassebner2016]. This lack of analytical consensus hinders our
ability to reliably predict or explain coup occurrences.

Second, while substantial attention focuses on traditional coups, another form of
irregular power transition is frequently overlooked, often not even framed within
the discourse of irregular leader transitions. This phenomenon, termed autocoup
in this thesis, involves an incumbent leader extending their mandated term beyond
constitutional limits, either through manipulating legal frameworks or by overtly
illegal means. Although an autocoup does not involve an immediate change in
leadership, it represents a fundamental disruption of the expected,
constitutionally-timed transition process. A scheduled transfer of power is
deliberately thwarted, making it a critical, yet under-examined, type of
irregular political event.

Therefore, this research argues for the necessity of analysing autocoups
alongside traditional coups within a unified framework. It is valuable to compare
these two distinct modes of irregular power retention/seizure, examining their
underlying drivers, consequences for leadership survival and regime durability,
and differential effects on democratic institutions.

The significance of this comparative approach is underscored by the severe
consequences often following irregular transitions. Such events—whether coups or
autocoups—not only risk immediate instability, violence, and potential conflict
but can also trigger cascading political upheaval. Ghana between 1979 and 1984
provides a stark illustration. Following Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings's
1979 coup, eight individuals, including three former heads of state, were
executed [@pieterse1982]. The instability persisted: Rawlings launched a second
coup in 1981, and his subsequent regime suppressed three further coup attempts
between 1982 and 1984 [@haynes2022d].

More fundamentally, both coups and autocoups tend to dismantle constitutional
safeguards, undermine democratic processes, and contribute either to democratic
backsliding or the consolidation of authoritarian rule. The urgency of this
investigation is amplified by current global trends. According to Freedom House’s
Freedom in the World 2024 report, global freedom declined for the 18th
consecutive year in 2023, with political rights and civil liberties worsening in
52 countries against improvements in only 21 [@freedomhouse2024freedom]. This
persistent erosion of democratic norms highlights the critical need to better
understand the mechanisms, like coups and autocoups, that facilitate such
declines.

To address these challenges, this study undertakes a comprehensive analysis
guided by four central research questions, which structure the subsequent
chapters. How do power dynamics and regime characteristics influence the
likelihood and success of traditional coup attempts? How can autocoups be
conceptually and analytically integrated alongside classic coups within a
comparative framework of irregular transitions? How does the specific method of
irregular power acquisition or retention—coup versus autocoup—impact subsequent
leadership longevity? What are the differential impacts of coups and autocoups on
democratization trajectories and the resilience of political institutions?

### Comparative framework: coups and autocoups

Coups have long dominated scholarly discourse on irregular leadership
transitions, largely due to their frequency, visibility, and clearly defined
parameters [@thyne2019]. Typically defined as the forcible removal of incumbent
leaders by elites within the existing power structure [@powell2011], coups
benefit from robust conceptual clarity. This has enabled the development of
comprehensive datasets and the application of rigorous empirical methods
[@gassebner2016; @thyne2019].

By contrast, another critical form of irregular leadership transition—the
autocoup, in which incumbents refuse to cede power and extend their tenure—has
received significantly less scholarly attention. This phenomenon is marked by
conceptual ambiguity, inconsistent terminology, the absence of standardized
datasets, and limited empirical analysis. As a result, research on the
determinants, consequences, and institutional impacts of autocoups remains
underdeveloped and fragmented.

To address this gap, the present study proposes a unified framework for analysing
coups and autocoups as distinct but interrelated forms of irregular leadership
transition. By examining them within a single comparative framework, this thesis
aims to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the political conditions that
enable leaders to either seize or retain power through extra-constitutional
means. This approach is both analytically necessary and timely for several key
reasons.

First, coups and autocoups are the most consequential mechanisms of irregular
leadership change, with far-reaching implications for democratic resilience,
institutional integrity, and political stability. Analysing them in tandem
provides a broader and more systematic evaluation of their impact on
democratization processes.

Second, while both types of events disrupt established norms of political
succession, they do so in opposite directions: coups forcibly truncate an
incumbent’s tenure, while autocoups illegitimately prolong it through legal
manipulation or coercive means. Comparing these opposing dynamics reveals
important insights into how power is both contested and consolidated in
contemporary regimes.

Third, this comparative lens offers a novel explanation for recent global
political trends. Specifically, it helps to reconcile the apparent paradox that
while the incidence of coups has declined since the 1990s [@bermeo2016], global
freedom has nonetheless deteriorated for 18 consecutive years
[@freedomhouse2024freedom]. By bringing autocoups into the analytical spotlight,
this research highlights how modern authoritarianism increasingly manifests not
through overt regime change, but through the gradual erosion of institutional
constraints and democratic norms from within.

### Research objectives and contributions

This study addresses a notable gap in the political science literature by
proposing a unified analytical framework to understand coups and autocoups as
interconnected forms of irregular leadership transition. It offers four principal
contributions that aim to advance scholarly understanding of how these phenomena
shape leadership dynamics and influence political development.

First, the study foregrounds the role of power dynamics among political actors as
the central explanatory tool for examining the causes, consequences, and broader
implications of both coups and autocoups. It argues that political power is not
only the ultimate objective for competing elites but also the primary engine
driving their contestation. Moreover, it is the balance of power among them that
most significantly determines the immediate outcomes and long-term implications
of coups and autocoups.

Second, the study refines the conceptualization of autocoups by placing them in
comparative perspective alongside traditional coups. On this conceptual
foundation, it introduces a refined dataset of autocoup events spanning the
period from 1945 to 2023. This dataset fills a critical lacuna in existing
scholarship, providing the empirical basis for systematic comparison and laying
the groundwork for future quantitative research into a phenomenon that has
hitherto remained understudied in political science.

Third, the research contributes to the literature on leadership survival by
assessing the longevity of leaders who ascend to power via coups compared to
those who extend tenure through autocoups. Employing survival analysis on both
established coup data and the newly compiled autocoup dataset, the study
demonstrates that the mode of power acquisition has a significant and measurable
impact on a leader’s post-event survival. This contribution adds depth to the
understanding of political durability and regime consolidation.

Fourth, the study investigates the democratic or autocratic trajectories that
follow coups and autocoups. Utilizing a country-fixed effects regression model,
it finds that autocoups are strongly correlated with sustained declines in
political freedom, both preceding and following the event—suggesting a durable
negative effect. In contrast, the aftermath of coups is more varied: although
typically marked by initial democratic erosion, some cases exhibit partial
recovery or even eventual democratization.

Collectively, these contributions enrich the academic discourse on irregular
leadership transitions by offering a generalizable and empirically grounded
framework. The findings illuminate the institutional consequences of coups and
autocoups and aim to inform both theoretical debates in comparative politics and
practical assessments of democratic resilience and authoritarian entrenchment in
the modern era.

### Policy implications

While a nuanced scholarly debate persists regarding whether coups can, under
certain circumstances, inadvertently contribute to democratization [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016], there is broad consensus that coups are not a
legitimate instrument for promoting democratic transitions. By their inherent
nature, coups constitute a violent rupture of the constitutional order,
frequently leading to immediate harm, political instability, and highly uncertain
long-term outcomes. Even when democratization eventually follows, the path is
typically fraught with high costs and unpredictability. Consequently,
policy-oriented research has predominantly focused on prevention, particularly
through "coup-proofing" strategies designed to insulate regimes from military
intervention [@quinlivan1999; @pilster2012; @powell; @albrecht2014; @carey2015;
@brown2015; @sudduth2017]. However, the effectiveness of such strategies is not
guaranteed and faces recognized limitations [@albrecht2014a; @albrecht2014;
@reiter2020]. Furthermore, as demonstrated in this thesis, the fundamental
structure of the regime, specifically its internal power dynamics, plays a
crucial role in determining the likelihood of coup attempts.

Stemming from this, the first key policy implication for preventing coups and
autocoups is the imperative to establish and maintain regimes grounded in a
stable balance of power. A more equitable distribution of power not only
diminishes the incentives and opportunities for actors to initiate a coup or an
autocoup but also enhances the regime's overall resilience and capacity to manage
or contain a coup or an autocoup attempt should one occur.

A second critical policy dimension involves the role of external actors.
International and regional organizations (IOs), alongside influential states like
the United States, have historically exerted significant influence in deterring
unconstitutional seizures of power. Prominent examples include regional bodies
such as MERCOSUR and the Organization of American States (OAS) in Latin America,
the African Union (AU) and ECOWAS in Africa, and the Council of Europe and the
European Union (EU) in Europe. On the global stage, the United Nations (UN)
Security Council can apply pressure, especially in cases involving severe
violations of democratic principles [@wobig2014; @shannon2014; @thyne2017].

These international actors typically operate through established normative
frameworks—such as treaties, charters, or membership agreements—that obligate
member states to uphold democratic governance. These frameworks often incorporate
accountability mechanisms and delineate sanctions for governments that attain
power through unconstitutional means, employ military force to resolve domestic
political disputes, or systematically dismantle democratic institutions.
Potential sanctions range from economic penalties and suspension of membership
privileges to, in rare and extreme cases, internationally sanctioned
intervention.

However, a significant limitation emerges: while these mechanisms possess
considerable deterrent capacity against overt military coups, they often prove
inadequate when confronting autocoups. Autocoups typically unfold under a veneer
of legality, leveraging constitutional manipulation and formal institutional
processes rather than overt military force. This subtler methodology makes it
difficult for international organizations to intervene decisively, often due to
perceived lacks of clear legal justification or sufficient political will among
member states.

This challenge is particularly relevant given contemporary political trends. As
prior research indicates, democratic backsliding increasingly manifests within
existing regimes through gradual erosion, rather than via overt regime change
[@mechkova2017]. The documented rise in autocoups since the year 2000 represents
a major driver of this phenomenon [@bermeo2016]. This study contributes to
understanding the causal factors behind this proliferation of autocoups.
Crucially, domestic constraints often hamper resistance to autocoups—these
include limitations on civil society mobilization, media repression, and the
capture of judicial independence. This reality elevates the importance of
external pressure from regional and international communities, making it an even
more critical potential counterweight.

Therefore, a third, crucial policy recommendation, building upon the second, is
that international organizations must adapt and expand their criteria for
engagement. Rather than solely reacting to dramatic, easily identifiable events
like military takeovers, they should develop mechanisms to monitor and respond to
the more gradual, incremental erosion of political freedoms and democratic norms.
For instance, sustained declines in recognized democracy indicators (e.g., Polity
scores, Freedom House ratings, V-Dem indices) could serve as early warning
signals, prompting preemptive diplomatic engagement or the imposition of
conditional sanctions. By adopting a more proactive, sensitive, and nuanced
approach, the international community can better preserve democratic standards
and respond more effectively to the insidious forms of authoritarian
consolidation, such as those typified by autocoups.

### Limitations and future research

While this study offers a novel framework for analysing coups and autocoups,
post-event leader survival, and their implications for political institutions,
several limitations highlight opportunities for future research.

Although the effort to define and classify autocoups represents a pioneering step
in this area, broader scholarly consensus on both the definition and the dataset
of autocoups remains limited. Future studies should aim to further refine and
expand these foundations.

On one hand, the very definition of autocoups remains contested—particularly in
cases where leaders extend their power through legal or quasi-legal mechanisms.
Future research could explore the trade-offs involved in including or excluding
such cases. Comparing the political consequences of "legal" versus "extra-legal"
power extensions may help clarify whether these should be categorized as
autocoups or as distinct phenomena.

On the other hand, challenges in defining autocoups directly affect the
construction of the dataset. Not only do definitional adjustments significantly
impact data collection, but the classification of specific cases can be
inherently ambiguous under current criteria. A case in point is President Zelaya
of Honduras in 2009. He proposed amending the 1965 Constitution—which imposed a
single-term life bans—to allow immediate re-election. However, the referendum on
this amendment was scheduled for the same day as the next presidential election,
which, under the existing Constitution, would already be underway. In other
words, even if the constitutional amendment had succeeded, Zelaya would not have
been in a position to benefit directly from it. Nonetheless, one cannot entirely
discount the possibility that this was a strategic move: by first proposing a
reform that ostensibly excluded him, he might have been seeking public approval
with the ultimate aim of modifying the plan to his benefit at a later stage.
Zelaya was subsequently removed from office in a coup, plunging Honduras into a
constitutional crisis [@muñoz-portillo2019].

Thus, both the conceptual framework and the dataset introduced in this study
would benefit from further refinement through additional theoretical and
empirical research. Future research should prioritize several promising
directions. Given the decline in traditional coups and the concurrent rise in
autocoups, increased scholarly attention to the latter is warranted. This study
primarily examined autocoups in the context of tenure extension; however, the
expansion of power by incumbent leaders also demands further investigation and
refined classification, given its frequency and detrimental effects on
institutions. Consequently, the development of a dedicated dataset on power
expansions is recommended. Finally, with the overall number of dramatic political
events, such as traditional coups, decreasing since 2000, the total number of
transitions from democracy to autocracy or vice versa has also declined.
Therefore, future empirical studies in political science should focus on
developing more sensitive measurements, such as small changes in Polity scores,
to capture subtle shifts within regimes.

### Overview of the thesis

This thesis investigates the complex power dynamics inherent in coups and
autocoups, examining their consequences for leadership survival and the integrity
of political institutions. The study concentrates on four interconnected areas:
first, identifying the structural determinants of classic coup attempts; second,
conceptualizing and analysing the distinct phenomenon of autocoups; third,
assessing how the method of power acquisition influences leadership longevity;
and fourth, evaluating the resultant impacts of these power seizures on political
institutions.

#### Chapter 2: Determinants of classic coup attempts {.unnumbered}

Classic coups have been a central focus of scholarly inquiry, particularly since
the early 2000s [@thyne2019]. However, despite extensive research
[@gassebner2016], a definitive consensus on the primary factors driving coup
attempts and determining their success remains elusive. This chapter contributes
to this ongoing debate by shifting the analytical focus from predominantly
adjustable, short-term factors towards more enduring structural conditions
inherent in regime types.

Much of the prior literature identifies potential coup triggers that are, in
principle, manageable or adjustable within a regime. These include factors such
as economic performance [@londregan1990; @galetovic2000; @kim2014; @powell2016],
the presence of institutionalized succession rules [@frantz2016],
military-specific variables like spending levels or officer training
[@powell2012; @leon2013a; @böhmelt2018], the occurrence of general elections
[@wig2016; @krishnarajan2020], the degree of media freedom [@boleslavsky2018],
levels of popular protest [@casper2013; @gerling2017], and class inequality
[@houle2014].

While these factors offer partial explanations, this line of inquiry faces
significant limitations. First, it struggles to adequately account for the
persistent variation in coup frequency across different regime types, notably the
higher incidence in autocracies compared to democracies [@thyne2019]. Second, if
these adjustable factors were the primary determinants, then targeted
"coup-proofing" strategies designed to mitigate them should be consistently
effective. Yet, empirically, such strategies often fail or prove impossible for
certain regimes to implement [@albrecht2014a; @albrecht2014; @reiter2020]. While
some analyses incorporate regime type, often using a simple democratic/autocratic
dichotomy [@hiroi2013; @schiel2019], this approach also proves insufficient,
failing to explain why, even within autocracies, certain types like military and
personalist regimes are demonstrably more coup-prone than others (e.g.,
dominant-party regimes).

This chapter advances the argument that coup risk is significantly predetermined
by the structural balance of power embedded within a regime's foundational type
from its inception. It contends that the probability of a coup attempt
fundamentally depends on the perceived power equilibrium between potential
plotters and the incumbent leadership. This balance is resistant to substantial
change post-establishment because the power structure itself is largely defined
by, and constitutive of, the regime type [@geddes2014]. Consequently, this study
operationalizes this concept by utilizing distinct regime types as proxies for
the underlying power balance between potential coup perpetrators and incumbents.

Acknowledging that coup attempts represent strategic calculations rather than
random events, the analysis employs a rigorous methodological approach. A double
probit model with sample selection, following @powell2012 and @böhmelt2014, is
applied to address the inherent selection bias (attempts are only observed if
initiated). This advanced technique allows for a more precise evaluation of the
factors influencing both the decision to attempt a coup and the likelihood of its
success. The analysis confirms that the anticipated probability of success is a
decisive factor in the plotters' strategic calculus, providing robust evidence
for the centrality of power dynamics. Crucially, the findings reveal that,
holding other factors constant, military regimes are approximately 277.7% more
likely, and personalist regimes 94% more likely, to experience coup attempts
compared to dominant-party regimes, underscoring the profound impact of regime
structure on coup vulnerability.

While the significance of regime type in determining coup attempts is widely
accepted—often leading to its inclusion as a control variable (e.g., democracy
vs. autocracy, military vs. civilian) [@frantz2016; @kim2021]—insufficient
attention has been paid to variations within autocratic regimes. This oversight
limits the ability of existing research to explain key empirical patterns,
notably why the overall decline in coups corresponds with the decreasing
frequency of military and personalist regimes, as evidenced by coup [@powell2011]
and regime [@geddes2014] data. Addressing this specific gap, this chapter
emphasizes the analytical importance of differentiating between regime types,
particularly autocratic subtypes. Furthermore, it highlights that the regime's
foundational structure, established at its inception, is critically important for
its subsequent stability and resilience against coups.

#### Chapter 3: Conceptualising and analysing autocoups {.unnumbered}

While scholarly interest in autocoups (executive coups) has grown significantly
since the 2000s [@ginsburg2010evasion; @baturo2014; @versteeg2020law], progress
has been hampered by persistent conceptual ambiguities and a scarcity of
systematic data [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This chapter directly
confronts these limitations by critically refining the concept of the autocoup
and introducing a comprehensive new dataset designed for rigorous quantitative
analysis.

This undertaking is motivated by two primary weaknesses identified in the
existing literature. First, a lack of conceptual precision often conflates
attempts by incumbents to expand their powers within their constitutionally
permitted term with efforts to extend their tenure beyond established limits.
This conflation groups dissimilar actions under the single, ambiguous label of
'autocoup'. Second, prevailing definitions of autocoups have often diverged from
the established definition of classic coups. Classic coups are consistently
defined by the unconstitutional removal or termination of tenure of an incumbent
leader [@powell2011]. In contrast, the term 'autocoup' has frequently been
applied inconsistently to encompass either power expansion or tenure extension
initiated by incumbent leaders, lacking a clear anchor to the core concept of
tenure disruption [@cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017; @marsteintredet2019;
@baturo2022].

Including actions aimed solely at power expansion (without tenure extension)
within the definition of autocoups presents significant analytical problems. Most
importantly, it renders autocoups conceptually distinct from classic coups,
hindering comparative analysis and theoretical integration, as the core event
(disruption of constitutionally prescribed tenure versus consolidation of power
within it) differs fundamentally. To build a more coherent framework for
understanding unconstitutional challenges to executive power, it is crucial to
bridge this analytical divide by aligning the conceptualization of autocoups more
closely with that of classic coups.

Accordingly, this study proposes and employs a more precise and theoretically
grounded definition: **an autocoup is the extension of an incumbent leader's
mandated term in office, achieved through either legal manipulation or explicitly
illegal means.** By centering the definition firmly on the extension of tenure,
this conceptualization sharply distinguishes autocoups from other forms of
executive aggrandizement or power consolidation that occur within mandated term
limits. Crucially, it also establishes conceptual consistency with classic coups,
as both phenomena fundamentally involve the disruption of constitutionally
prescribed leadership tenure.

Based on this refined definition, the chapter introduces a major empirical
contribution: a novel dataset documenting autocoup events globally from 1945 to
2023. This dataset identifies 109 distinct autocoup attempts during this period,
of which 87 were successful. Providing comprehensive, systematically coded data
on these events represents a significant resource for the field, enabling more
robust and nuanced quantitative analyses of autocoups, their causes, and
consequences than previously possible. The chapter further demonstrates the
dataset's analytical utility through illustrative case studies and preliminary
empirical analyses, highlighting the role of autocoups in driving processes of
democratic backsliding and the personalization of political power.

#### Chapter 4: Power acquisition methods and leadership Survival {.unnumbered}

A substantial body of scholarship has analysed the tenure survival of leaders who
come to power through irregular transitions, with a primary focus on those
installed via classic coups [@gandhi2007; @arbatli2014; @martin2017;
@sudduth2017; @thyne2017; @easton2018]. However, as established in Chapter 3, the
historical lack of systematic data on autocoups has precluded rigorous
quantitative analysis of autocoup leader survival and, consequently, systematic
comparisons between the post-transition trajectories of coup-installed leaders
and autocoup leaders. Building upon the conceptual work and data development of
the preceding chapters, this chapter addresses this significant gap by presenting
the first comparative survival analysis of leaders following classic coups versus
those executing autocoups, situated within a unified theoretical framework.

This chapter posits that leaders seizing power after a classic coup face
fundamentally different challenges compared to incumbents who execute an autocoup
to extend their rule. Specifically, it argues that coup-installed leaders
typically grapple with higher levels of perceived illegitimacy, greater political
uncertainty, and more pronounced instability in the immediate post-transition
period. These disparities, stemming from the distinct nature of the power seizure
(external overthrow vs. internal manipulation), create divergent power
consolidation dynamics that place coup leaders at a relative disadvantage
compared to their autocoup counterparts. Consequently, the central hypothesis
tested is that leaders extending their tenure via autocoup are likely to exhibit
greater political longevity compared to leaders installed following a classic
coup.

To rigorously test this hypothesis, the study employs survival analysis
techniques, specifically the Cox proportional hazards model and the
time-dependent Cox model. These statistical methods allow for a nuanced
examination of how the mode of irregular power acquisition influences leadership
duration, controlling for relevant covariates. The empirical findings lend strong
support to the chapter's central argument, revealing that the method of power
acquisition significantly impacts subsequent leader tenure. Specifically, the
results demonstrate that, controlling for other factors, leaders installed via
classic coups are, on average, 2.23 times more likely to be forcibly removed from
office than leaders who successfully execute an autocoup to remain in power.

This analysis persuasively explains a significant contemporary political trend:
the increasing prevalence of autocoups alongside the decline of classic coups,
particularly since the early 2000s. The findings reveal clear incentives driving
this shift. Leaders who orchestrate autocoups not only achieve a higher success
rate and face a significantly lower risk of post-coup ouster compared to those
who come to power through classic coups, but they also tend to enjoy considerably
longer tenures. These improved prospects for long-term rule make the autocoup a
more appealing strategy for incumbents seeking to retain power
unconstitutionally.

#### Chapter 5: Coups, autocoups, and democracy {.unnumbered}

Much like the extensive literature on the relationship between coups and leader
survival, the impact of coups on democratization has been widely studied
[@clayton2000; @powell2014a; @thyne2020; @powell2018a]. Although scholarly debate
continues regarding whether coups can positively contribute to democratization, a
considerable body of empirical work has explored this question [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016; @derpanopoulos2017].

In contrast, due to the historical lack of comprehensive datasets on autocoups,
systematic analysis of their effects on democratization has largely remained
confined to case studies [@baturo; @marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This
chapter seeks to address this gap by providing a quantitative analysis of the
impact of autocoups on democratic outcomes.

Unlike traditional coups—which may lead to regime transitions between democracy
and autocracy—autocoups typically do not involve a change in leadership or ruling
coalition. Rather, they represent an internal concentration of power, often
executed by incumbents dismantling institutional constraints without formal
regime change. Consequently, this chapter evaluates the effects of autocoups not
through regime transition metrics, but through shifts in Polity scores, a
continuous measure of institutional democratic quality.

I advance two central arguments. First, incumbent leaders often begin weakening
institutional checks in anticipation of an autocoup, resulting in declining
Polity scores even before the event takes place. Second, while traditional coups
yield mixed outcomes—occasionally facilitating democratic transitions—autocoups
almost invariably result in democratic erosion or deeper authoritarian
consolidation, given their intentional design to dismantle institutional
safeguards and prolong executive tenure beyond normal political limits.

Using a country-fixed effects model and newly compiled datasets on both coups and
autocoups, this chapter demonstrates that Polity scores consistently decline
before and after an autocoup, reflecting both preparatory and post-event
institutional weakening. In contrast, coups typically cause an immediate drop in
democratic quality, but in some cases, a degree of recovery follows.

These findings highlight the distinct political trajectories associated with
coups and autocoups. This research not only fills a critical empirical gap in the
study of autocoups but also underscores their substantial and often
underestimated role in accelerating democratic backsliding. The chapter
ultimately contributes to academic and policy discussions by emphasizing the need
to treat autocoups as a unique and deeply corrosive threat to democratic
governance.

#### Chapter 6: Conclusion and future research directions {.unnumbered}

This concluding chapter synthesizes the key findings from the preceding chapters,
providing a comprehensive understanding of the structural, strategic, and
institutional dynamics that drive both coups and autocoups. Drawing upon the
evidence presented in Chapters 2 through 5, it emphasizes the profound impact of
irregular power transitions—whether classic coups or autocoups—on leadership
survival and the evolution of political regimes.

Collectively, these chapters illuminate the evolving landscape of irregular power
transitions. Coups and autocoups emerge not simply as disruptive events, but as
strategic mechanisms employed by political actors to recalibrate or solidify
power. Their contrasting institutional legacies—destabilization versus
consolidation—highlight the importance of treating them as distinct phenomena,
each governed by unique causal mechanisms and yielding distinct consequences.

This research carries significant implications for comprehending contemporary
political challenges, including the resilience of authoritarianism, the
vulnerability of democratic institutions, and the strategic calculations of
political elites. By clarifying the structural and strategic factors that
determine coups and autocoups, this study advances a more nuanced theory of power
transitions and regime stability.

Future research should pursue several promising directions. First, the phenomenon
of power expansion by incumbent leaders warrants deeper investigation and more
precise classification, given its growing frequency and corrosive impact on
political institutions. This calls for the development of a dedicated dataset
specifically tracking such expansions. Second, greater scholarly attention should
be directed toward analysing minor fluctuations in Polity scores, which may
reveal subtle yet significant shifts in democratic quality within regimes.

## Power Dynamics and Coup Attempts: A Selection Mechanism Analysis {#sec-chapter2}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter examines coup attempts by focusing on the expected probability of
success as a key driver of coup decisions. Using a double probit model with
sample selection, the study investigates the relationship between regime types
and coup attempts, focusing on the balance of power between coup plotters and
incumbent leaders. The findings reveal that regime type is a significant
determinant of coup attempts. Notably, compared to dominant-party regimes,
military regimes are approximately 277.7% more likely, and personalist regimes
are 94% more likely to experience coups, all else being equal. This heightened
vulnerability can be attributed to the weaker institutional frameworks and
internal power struggles characteristic of these regimes.

Coups d’état, defined as "illegal and overt attempts by the military or other
elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive" [@powell2011],
represent a critical threat to constitutional leadership transitions and
political stability. The frequency and success of these attempts vary
significantly across countries and regions, prompting essential questions about
**why coups are more prevalent in certain countries and why some coups succeed
while others fail**.

For instance, according to the Global Instances of Coups dataset [@powell2011]
(GIC), Latin America and Africa have seen notable variation in coup activity.
Bolivia experienced `r coups |> filter(country == "Bolivia") |> pull(2)` coups
between 1950 and 1984, and Argentina saw
`r coups |> filter(country == "Argentina") |> pull(2)` coups during a similar
period. In Africa, Sudan endured
`r coups |> filter(country == "Sudan") |> pull(2)` coups between 1955 and 2023.
In stark contrast, countries such as Mexico and South Africa have remained
coup-free since 1950.

Despite decades of scholarly inquiry and the identification of over 100 potential
determinants [@gassebner2016], a consensus on the key factors driving coup
attempts and their outcomes remains elusive. The proliferation of variables
presents a significant challenge: Is there a more effective analytical framework
that prioritizes the most relevant factors of coups, rather than sifting through
an ever-expanding list of possibilities?

This chapter introduces a novel perspective on understanding coup dynamics by
shifting the focus from pre-coup conditions to the strategic calculations of
potential coup plotters. I contend that the anticipated probability of success is
a crucial determinant in the decision to initiate a coup. This argument is
substantiated by several key observations:

-   **High stakes of coups**: Failed coup attempts often result in severe
    consequences for participants, including imprisonment, exile, or even death.
    This underscores the critical importance of success for potential plotters.

-   **Selectivity of Coup Attempts**: Despite 491 recorded attempts since 1950,
    these represent a small fraction (approximately 4%) of over 12,000
    country-years during the same period (GIC). This suggests that coups are not
    impulsive acts but rather carefully calculated gambles.

-   **Relatively high success rates**: Approximately half of all coup attempts
    succeed (GIC). This further suggests that plotters are selective, choosing to
    act only when they perceive a significant likelihood of success.

Given the difficulty in directly observing the probability of coup success, this
study proposes using regime type as a crucial proxy for predicting coup outcomes.
The underlying premise is that the balance of power within a regime, which is
significantly influenced by its type, ultimately shapes the outcomes of coups. By
analysing power dynamics across various regime types, we can gain more profound
insights into the structural factors that affect both the likelihood of coup
attempts and their success.

To address the inherent selection bias in studying coup attempts, this research
employs a double probit model with sample selection, building on the
methodological approaches used by @powell2012 and @böhmelt2014. This method
enables the simultaneous analysis of factors influencing both the initiation and
success of coups.

This study aims to contribute to scholarly discourse and practical efforts in two
key ways:

-   **Re-framing coup dynamics through the lens of expected success**: By
    emphasizing the expected chances of success as a driver of coup attempts,
    this research offers a more targeted approach to understanding coup dynamics.
    Specifically, it highlights the selective effect of anticipated outcomes on
    coup initiation, providing a more nuanced understanding of the strategic
    calculations underlying coup attempts.

-   **Illuminating the role of regime type in shaping coup outcomes**: In the
    absence of perfect knowledge of internal power balances, this study leverages
    regime types as a proxy for power structures. By examining the relationship
    between regime type and anticipated coup outcomes, this research sheds light
    on how these structures influence the likelihood of coup success, thereby
    informing strategies for coup prevention and mitigation.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 delves into the
complexities of coup attempts and their outcomes, providing a nuanced examination
of the underlying dynamics. Section 3 outlines the research design, methodology,
and variables employed in this study, providing a transparent and detailed
account of the analytical framework. Section 4 presents and interprets the
empirical findings, highlighting the key patterns and trends that emerge from the
data. Section 5 concludes the chapter by distilling the main insights and
implications of the study, and exploring their potential applications in
understanding and mitigating coup risks.

### Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes

Coup attempts represent a critical juncture in the political landscape of
regimes, driven by a complex interplay of factors that can be broadly categorized
into two main components: the **disposition** of potential challengers (their
motivations and willingness to act) and their **capability** (the resources and
opportunities available to them). This analysis delves into the intricate
dynamics of coup attempts, examining the underlying motivations, factors
influencing their success, and the role of regime types in shaping a country's
susceptibility to coups.

#### Motivations for coups

Coup plotters are driven by a range of motivations, which can be distilled into
three primary categories: personal ambition, purported national interest, and
self-preservation.

-   **Personal ambition:** The allure of absolute power is a potent motivator for
    many coup plotters. The prospect of seizing control offers the ability to
    shape national policies without constraint, command significant resources and
    wealth, make impactful decisions that affect millions, and bask in the
    prestige and recognition that comes with holding power. The opportunity to
    leave a lasting historical legacy is also a powerful draw.

-   **Purported national interest:** Coup leaders often justify their actions as
    necessary interventions for the greater good of the nation. While such claims
    should be scrutinized, some examples demonstrate genuine attempts to address
    critical issues, such as resolving constitutional crises, facilitating
    transitions to democracy, or addressing severe economic downturns or social
    unrest. The 2010 coup in Niger, which ousted President Tandja after he sought
    an unconstitutional third term, is a notable example [@ginsburg2019].

-   **Self-preservation:** In some instances, coups serve as pre-emptive strikes
    against perceived existential threats. Motivations in this category include
    preventing elimination or political persecution by incumbent leaders,
    protecting the interests of specific military or political factions, and
    safeguarding ideological or ethnic groups from marginalization. The 1971 coup
    led by Idi Amin against Ugandan President Obote exemplifies this motivation,
    as Amin acted to prevent his removal from a key military command position
    [@sudduth2017].

Despite these potential motivations, it is crucial to note that coups remain
relatively uncommon events. Since 1950, coups have occurred in only about 4% of
country-years. This rarity underscores the importance of the capability factor –
even the most motivated actors require substantial resources and favourable
circumstances to successfully execute a coup.

#### Capability for coups

While motivations may spark coup attempts, the capability to launch a successful
coup is often more decisive. This capability is pivotal in determining whether
potential coup plotters transition from mere contemplation to concrete action.
Several key factors influence this capability, which can be broadly categorized
into five main areas:

-   **Military strength**: A significant advantage in military capabilities over
    the incumbent regime substantially increases the odds of a successful coup
    [@powell2018; @choulis2022]. This factor encompasses control over elite
    military units or special forces, access to advanced weaponry and technology,
    loyalty of key military commanders, and strategic positioning of supportive
    military units. The balance of military power is often the most critical
    determinant of coup success, as it directly affects the ability to seize and
    hold key government installations.

-   **Internal divisions within the regime**: Exploiting existing fractures
    within the government's power structure can provide coup plotters with a
    critical advantage. These divisions may manifest as ideological disagreements
    among ruling elites, competing centers of power within the government, ethnic
    or regional tensions in the political leadership, or dissatisfaction among
    mid-level bureaucrats or military officers. Coup plotters can leverage these
    divisions to build a coalition of support, promising benefits or addressing
    grievances of marginalized factions within the regime.

-   **Public support**: Widespread discontent with the incumbent leaders,
    particularly within the military or key sectors of society, can create a
    fertile environment for a successful coup. Factors contributing to public
    support include economic hardship or inequality, perceived corruption or
    mismanagement by the government, human rights abuses or political repression,
    and failure to address critical national issues. While public support alone
    may not be sufficient for coup success, it can provide legitimacy to the coup
    plotters and reduce resistance from the general population.

-   **Foreign backing**: External support from powerful nations can provide
    resources, legitimacy, and even direct military intervention to tip the
    scales in favor of the coup plotters. This support may take various forms,
    including financial assistance, intelligence sharing, diplomatic recognition,
    covert military aid or training, and threats of intervention against the
    incumbent regime. The role of foreign backing in coups has been particularly
    significant during the Cold War era and continues to shape geopolitical
    dynamics in many regions.

-   **Timing and opportunity**: Identifying and exploiting moments of
    vulnerability in the incumbent leaders is crucial for coup success. Opportune
    moments may include national crises or emergencies, periods of political
    transition or uncertainty, major public events or celebrations, and times of
    internal conflict within the regime. Coup plotters must carefully assess
    these windows of opportunity and time their actions to maximize their chances
    of success.

#### The selection mechanism in staging coups

While historical data may suggest a high success rate for coups, it is crucial to
consider the inherent selection bias when interpreting this information.
Observers are limited to studying only attempted coups, neglecting the numerous
plots that never materialize. This limitation presents a significant challenge in
accurately assessing the true likelihood of coup success.

Several factors contribute to this selection bias:

-   **Unobserved deterrence**: Preemptive measures by incumbent regimes may
    effectively deter coup attempts before they materialize, rendering them
    invisible to statistical analysis.

-   **Self-selection of capable plotters**: Those who attempt coups are likely to
    do so only when they perceive a reasonable chance of success, leading to an
    overestimation of the overall success rate in observed data.

-   **Unreported failed attempts**: Many unsuccessful coup attempts, particularly
    those in the early planning stages, may go unreported or remain undetected,
    further skewing the available data.

-   **Varying definitions of "coup attempt"**: Inconsistencies in how researchers
    define and classify coup attempts can introduce additional bias into the
    data, complicating cross-study comparisons.

To address these challenges and understand coup attempts more comprehensively, a
theoretical framework is needed to account for this selection bias. A frequently
cited framework [@gassebner2016; @aidt2019] offers a structured approach to
assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the
anticipated benefits for coup plotters.

The expected pay-off of a coup can be represented by the equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(U) = p \times B + (1 - p) \times (-C)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq1}

Where:

-   $E(U)$**:** Expected utility or pay-off of the coup attempt;
-   $B$ represents the return of a successful coup;
-   $C$ signifies the cost of a failed coup;
-   $p$ represents the probability of coup success.

The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive
($E(U) > 0$). Rearranging the equation, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p \times B > (1 - p) \times C
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq2}

This implies that for a coup to be attempted, the expected benefits of success
must outweigh the expected costs of failure.

However, quantifying $B$ and $C$ is inherently difficult due to several factors.
The intangible nature of some costs and benefits (e.g., loss of life, personal
freedom). The variability of outcomes across different contexts. The subjective
valuation of power and risk by individual coup plotters.

Given the difficulty in precisely quantifying $B$ and $C$, we can treat them as
roughly equal for analytical purposes. This allows us to shift our focus to the
probability of success ($p$). The simplified equation becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p > (1-p)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq3}

This suggests that a success probability greater than 50% is necessary for a coup
to be attempted. While empirical data shows a slightly lower overall success rate
for coups since 1950 (49.9%, as shown in @tbl-coups), it is crucial to remember
that this is an average and does not reflect the specific probabilities assessed
by coup plotters beforehand.

Based on this discussion, we propose the following hypothesis:

> **H2-1: *The fundamental determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance
> of success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least
> 50%.***

This hypothesis fundamentally shifts the focus of coup research from the
prerequisites for triggering a coup to the expected coup outcome as the primary
determinant. By doing so, it underscores the importance of understanding the
factors that influence coup plotters' perceptions of success probability, thereby
highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach to coup analysis.

A natural follow-up question arises: What factors determine coup success and,
subsequently, influence the decision to attempt one? The answer lies in
understanding the complex balance of power inherent in the diverse power dynamics
across various regime types.

#### Regime types and coup susceptibility

Existing research on coup plotting often concentrates on the dispositions and
capabilities of potential perpetrators, overlooking a crucial factor: the dynamic
balance of power between those initiating a coup and the incumbent regime. Even
when dispositions and capabilities are similar, coup outcomes can vary
significantly depending on this balance, underscoring the mediating role of power
dynamics in influencing the strategic calculus of potential coup plotters.

For instance, solely attributing coup attempts to military strength
oversimplifies the complex reality of these events [@singh2016]. In a highly
centralized personalist regime, control over the military may be concentrated in
the hands of a small, loyalist faction, making it difficult for potential rivals
to garner the necessary support for a successful coup. Conversely, in a more
fragmented military regime, internal divisions and competing power centres can
create opportunities for ambitious officers to mobilize support and challenge the
ruling junta. As @geddes1999 notes, a coup's success often hinges on the
reactions of these other factions, creating a complex decision-making environment
for potential plotters. Furthermore, incumbents frequently employ strategic
division within the military as a coup-proofing measure [@böhmelt2014]. This
involves intentionally creating rival groups within the armed forces,
establishing an artificial balance and structural obstacles to coup attempts.
Additionally, factors beyond military force, such as internal divisions among
ruling elites, public support, and foreign backing, significantly shape the
balance of power.

Consequently, a more comprehensive approach involves analyzing the overall
balance of power within a political system. However, as noted in the
introduction, directly observing this balance presents significant challenges for
outside observers, including policy-makers, international organizations, and even
potential coup plotters themselves. An alternative approach, and the one adopted
in this study, is to analyze factors that decisively shape power dynamics. This
method aligns more closely with academic research goals, which focus on
understanding the patterns and underlying factors of coup attempts rather than
identifying specific power challengers capable of launching successful coups.

Among the various factors influencing power dynamics, regime type emerges as one
of the most crucial and observable. Regime types are fundamentally
classifications based on power structures within a political system, and
different regime types allocate authority differently for critical decisions such
as the deployment of military forces, appointment of key officials and military
officers, and formulation and implementation of main policies. This allocation of
authority, in turn, shapes the incentives and opportunities for potential coup
plotters, influencing their likelihood of success.

@geddes2014 provides a classification of autocratic regime types based on their
power structures, offering valuable insights into the power dynamics within
different autocracies and their relative susceptibility to coups. The three main
types of autocratic regimes, their characteristics, and their vulnerability to
coup attempts are explored as follows (see @tbl-regimes1):

-   **Military regimes:** These are characterized by a junta – a group of
    military officers controlling leadership selection and policy formulation.
    Examples include regimes in Brazil (1964-1985), Argentina (1976-1983), and El
    Salvador (1948-1984) [@geddes1999]. Despite their military nature, these
    regimes are surprisingly unstable due to internal power struggles within the
    junta. The absence of a clear final authority and the presence of multiple
    military factions increase the likelihood of resorting to force to resolve
    disputes, making these regimes the most vulnerable to coups.

-   **Personalist regimes:** In these regimes, power is concentrated in a single,
    charismatic leader who controls the military, policy, and succession.
    Examples include Rafael Trujillo's regime in the Dominican Republic
    (1930-1961), Idi Amin's regime in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel
    Bokassa's regime in the Central African Republic (1966-1979) [@geddes1999].
    Personalist regimes are relatively stable during the leader's tenure.
    However, they face a higher risk of coups due to unclear succession plans and
    vulnerabilities associated with the leader's personal weaknesses, health, and
    mortality.

-   **Dominant-party regimes:** In these systems, power resides within a
    well-organized ruling party, with leaders acting as its representatives. The
    party structure and ideology foster internal cohesion and a long-term vision.
    Examples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico,
    the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various
    Eastern European countries [@geddes1999]. Dominant-party regimes exhibit the
    greatest resilience against coups due to their institutionalized structures,
    unified leadership, clear ideology, and internal discipline.

Empirical data supports the theoretical framework that different regime types
exhibit varying levels of susceptibility to coups. Military regimes, constituting
only 5.6% of country-years since 1950, experience a disproportionate share of
coups (over 22%). In contrast, dominant-party regimes, representing 22.6% of
country-years, account for only 16.7% of coups (see @tbl-regimes). These
statistics demonstrate the disproportionate vulnerability of military and
personalist regimes to coups, while highlighting the relative stability of
dominant-party regimes.

The distinct power dynamics exhibited by these regime types significantly
influence their susceptibility to coups. This analysis leads to the second
hypothesis:

> **H2-2: *The susceptibility to coups varies significantly among different types
> of autocratic regimes, with military regimes being the most vulnerable,
> followed by personalist regimes, and dominant-party regimes being the least
> susceptible.***

### Research design

#### Double probit with sample selection model {#sec-coup231}

This study employs a sophisticated statistical approach to account for the
selective nature of coup attempts. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes,
success rates tend to be surprisingly consistent, hovering around 50% (as shown
in @tbl-regimes). This suggests that coup attempts are not random acts, but
rather strategically planned and undertaken only when the odds of success appear
favourable. A standard statistical model would not account for this selectivity,
potentially leading to biased results.

To address this issue, we utilize a double probit with sample selection model.
This model, known as a Heckman probit model or bivariate probit model with sample
selection, consists of two parts:

-   **Selection equation (Stage 1)**: This stage analyses the factors influencing
    whether a coup attempt occurs in a particular country-year.

-   **Outcome equation (Stage 2)**: This stage focuses on the probability of
    success for those coup attempts that actually take place.

The selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt
occurs:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{1i}^*&=\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 Regime_i + \mathbf{X}_i \boldsymbol{A} + \mu_{1i}
\\
\\
y_{1i} &= 
\begin{cases} 
1 &\text{if $y_{1i}^*>0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\
\\
0 &\text{if $y_{1i}^*\le0$ (no coup attempt)}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq4}

The outcome equation (second stage) models the probability of a coup attempt
succeeding, given it occurs.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_{2i}^*&=\beta_0 + \beta_1 Regime_i + \mathbf{Z}_i \boldsymbol{B} + \mu_{2i}
\\
\\
y_{2i} &= 
\begin{cases} 
1 &\text{if $y_{2i}^*>0$ (coup succeeds)} \\
\\
0 &\text{if $y_{2i}^*\le0$ (coup fails)}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq5}

Where:

-   $y_{1i}^*$ *and* $y_{2i}^*$ are latent variables

-   $\text{Regime}_i$ is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or
    dominant-party)

-   $\mathbf{X}_i$ and $\mathbf{Z}_i$ are vectors of control variables

-   $\mu_{1i}$ and $\mu_{2i}$ are error terms, assumed to follow a bivariate
    normal distribution with correlation $\rho$

The model assumes:

$$
\binom{\mu_{1 i}}{\mu_{2 i}} \sim N\left(\binom{0}{0},\left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \rho \\
\rho & 1
\end{array}\right)\right)
$$

The probability equations are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\left(y_{1 i}=1\right) & =\Phi\left(\alpha_0+\alpha_1 \operatorname{Regime}_i+\mathbf{X}_i \boldsymbol{A}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq7}

$$
\begin{aligned}
P\left(y_{2 i}=1 \mid y_{1 i}=1\right) & =\Phi\left(\beta_0+\beta_1 \operatorname{Regime}_i+\mathbf{Z}_i \boldsymbol{B}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq8}

Where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard
normal distribution.

#### Variables

##### Dependent variable

The analysis utilizes data on coup attempts and outcomes from @powell2011. A
successful coup is defined as one where the incumbent leader is removed from
power for more than seven days. The dataset covers the period from 1950 to 2023
and includes information on 491 coup attempts, with roughly half (245) being
successful. Descriptive statistics for these coup attempts and regime types can
be found in @tbl-coups and @tbl-regimes.

-   **Coup attempt**: Binary variable indicating whether a coup attempt
    occurred (1) or not (0) in a given country-year.

-   **Coup success**: Binary variable indicating whether a coup attempt was
    successful (1) or failed (0), conditional on a coup attempt occurring.

##### Key independent variable: regime type {#sec-chapter2322}

I categorize regime types following @geddes2014 (GWF), focusing on military,
personalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included
for comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in
@tbl-regimes.

##### Control variables

The control variables are chosen based on the research of @gassebner2016. They
analysed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic
growth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are
particularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance,
political violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control
variables.

```{r}
#| label: variables
#| results: asis
#| echo: false
gdppc <- "-   **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an
    indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a
    country. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international 1000
    dollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by @fariss2022."

ct <- "-   **Economic Performance:** Measured using the current-trend ($CT$) ratio
    developed by @krishnarajan2019. This ratio compares a country's current GDP
    per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A
    higher $CT$ ratio indicates stronger economic performance. For a country $i$
    at year $t$, the $CT$ ratio is calculated as follows:"

glue(gdppc)
glue(ct)
```

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \over {1 \over 5} {\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}
    \end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-eq6}

-   **Political stability:** This variable captures overall regime stability by
    including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and
    interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the
    variable “actotal” in the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset
    [@marshall2005current], with 0 representing the most stable conditions (no
    violence at all) and 18 representing the most unstable.
-   **Previous coups:** Included in the selection equation as either: a) The
    number of previous coups in a country (Model 1), or b) The time since the
    last coup attempt (Model 2 for robustness check).

The double probit model with sample selection, estimated using the
***sampleSelection*** package [@sampleSelection-2] in R, provides valuable
insights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their outcomes across
different regime types from 1950 to 2019 (@tbl-coupmodel). I present two models
that differ slightly in their treatment of previous coups: Model 1 incorporates
the number of previous coups, while Model 2 utilizes the time elapsed since the
last coup.

#### Selection model: coup attempts

The selection model (Column 1) reveals that military and personalist regimes
exhibit significant positive coefficients at the 1% level, indicating a higher
likelihood of experiencing coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes. This
aligns with the theoretical expectations regarding internal power struggles
within military juntas and succession vulnerabilities in personalist regimes.

@tbl-mfx1 presents the Average Marginal Effects (AME) and ratio percentages to
clarify the regime effects. The military regime's marginal effect of 0.07
indicates that the probability of coup attempts in military regimes is 7
percentage points (pp) higher than in dominant-party regimes, ceteris paribus.
This translates to military regimes being about 277.7% more likely to encounter
coups than dominant-party regimes. Similarly, personalist regimes show a 2.4 pp
higher probability, about 94% more likely compared to dominant-party regimes.

The control variables show effects in expected directions but with weaker
magnitudes. Stronger economic performance, indicated by higher economic growth
trends and GDP per capita levels, correlates with a lower risk of coup attempts.
Political violence shows a positive effect, indicating that higher levels of
instability increase the likelihood of coups. The positive coefficient for the
number of previous coups suggests a "copycat" effect from earlier incidents.

#### Outcome model: coup success

Turning to the outcome model (Columns 2 and 4 in @tbl-coupmodel), the results
reveal determinants of coup success. Military regimes demonstrate a higher
probability of coup success compared to dominant-party regimes, aligning with
expectations that military regimes face higher coup risks due to their increased
chances of success. Personalist and monarchical regimes show slight positive
effects on coup success, but these effects are not statistically significant.

The control variables exhibit different patterns in the outcome model compared to
the selection model. Both GDP per capita and political violence maintain a weak
influence, similar to their effects in the selection model. However, the economic
trend shows a less significant negative effect on coup success.

#### Model comparison (model 1 versus model 2)

Comparing the two models, Model 2 employs years since the last coup instead of
the number of previous coups, with an interaction term between previous coups (as
a binary variable) and years since the last coup. Generally, Model 2 shows
results in the same direction as Model 1, albeit with relatively lower
coefficients (see @tbl-mfx2).

The differences between Model 1 and Model 2 suggest that while the recency of
coups matters, the overall history of coups in a country may have a stronger
influence on future coup attempts.

#### Discussion of key findings

The $ρ$ values of 0.898 in Model 1 and 0.386 in Model 2, significant at 1% and
10% levels respectively, indicate strong correlation between unobserved factors
influencing coup attempts and coup success. This supports the appropriateness of
the sample selection model and underscores the importance of considering both
stages in the analysis.

The significant coefficients with theoretically consistent directions suggest the
model effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. The observed disparity
between coup attempt rates and success rates across regimes points towards
selection bias, further validating the use of the sample selection model.

#### Implications

The results of this study strongly corroborate the theoretical framework
delineated in this chapter, highlighting the critical role that regime structure
and the anticipated probability of coup success play in determining a regime's
susceptibility to coup. These findings underscore that coups are strategic
actions undertaken when circumstances appear favourable, rather than random
occurrences.

The implications of these results for real-world politics are profound. Given
that the perceived likelihood of successful coup execution is pivotal in coup
attempts, incumbent leaders—particularly those in autocratic regimes—will be
strongly motivated to concentrate their efforts on diminishing the capabilities
of potential coup plotters, rather than merely addressing the underlying
dispositions toward staging a coup.

In practice, this implies that autocratic leaders are likely to prioritize
"coup-proofing" strategies. These may include appointing loyal generals and
officials over competent ones, fostering factional divisions within the elite,
and removing capable or popular military officers and government officials—even
those who remain loyal. However, this approach can precipitate a vicious cycle.

The adage, "New levels, new devils", aptly captures the cyclical nature of coup
risk mitigation. Incumbents, often lulled into a false sense of security after
neutralizing immediate threats, may find themselves facing new challenges as a
direct consequence of their actions. The very act of suppressing potential
rivals, while seemingly strengthening their grip on power, inevitably fosters
resentment and grievances among those disenfranchised. This, in turn, makes the
prospect of a coup increasingly enticing, shifting the calculus of risk for
potential plotters. While capability remains paramount in determining the success
of any coup attempt, the disposition for such an undertaking, fuelled by
discontent and perceptions of vulnerability, cannot be disregarded.
Paradoxically, heavy-handed crackdowns on opposition, intended to deter
challenges, can inadvertently lower the perceived costs of staging a coup,
creating a fertile ground for future instability.

Moreover, if incumbent leaders devote excessive attention to coup-proofing at the
expense of economic growth and social development, they are likely to resort to
increasingly autocratic forms of governance. This, in turn, can lead to
democratic backsliding or even outright breakdown, as well as the entrenchment of
authoritarian and personalistic rule.

In conclusion, the findings of this study offer critical insights into the
complex dynamics underlying coup attempts and the strategic calculus of incumbent
regimes. Navigating these challenges will require a delicate balance between
addressing the capabilities and dispositions of potential coup plotters while
maintaining a focus on broader governance, economic, and social priorities.
Future research should explore the long-term consequences of coup-proofing
strategies on regime stability and societal well-being, as well as potential
alternative approaches to mitigating coup risks without compromising democratic
values and institutions.

### Summary

This chapter explores the most frequent irregular leadership transition, coups,
that destabilize political systems and disrupt democratic transitions worldwide,
a phenomenon that has garnered extensive scholarly attention yet remains a
challenging puzzle. To shed new light on this issue, this study introduces a
novel perspective by emphasizing the determinants that impact coup success,
moving beyond the mere capability to launch a coup and focusing on the expected
probability of success. This approach highlights the critical role played by the
perceived balance of power between coup plotters and the incumbents in
determining outcomes.

The study employs a double probit model with sample selection, which enables a
nuanced analysis of the relationship between regime types and coup likelihood.
The results affirm that regime type significantly influences coup vulnerability,
with military and personalist regimes exhibiting higher susceptibility to coups
compared to dominant-party regimes. This finding is corroborated by historical
examples, such as the frequent instability and coup attempts experienced by
military regimes in Latin America during the 20th century and various African
personalist regimes. The study underscores the importance of building regimes
with strong constitutional institutions, as those reliant on military or personal
authority prove to be more prone to coups.

A key contribution of this study is its exploration of the paradox faced by
autocratic rulers, such as dictators and military juntas. While institutional
strengthening could promote regime longevity and reduce the risk of coups, many
autocrats resist such reforms due to the potential limitations they might impose
on their power. Institutionalization, while beneficial for the regime's long-term
stability, may not align with the short-term interests of individual leaders who
prioritize their personal control and authority over broader regime security.

The study also identifies policy implications for enhancing political stability,
including promoting economic development, strengthening institutional frameworks,
and encouraging political inclusivity. This shift towards institutionalization
could help reduce the volatility that often accompanies military and personalist
regimes.

Furthermore, this research opens several avenues for further inquiry, including:

-   Examining the long-term effects of regime types on political stability,
    including trends toward democratization or authoritarian personalization.
-   Investigating the role of international factors in influencing regime types
    and coup dynamics, especially when internal mechanisms are insufficient to
    prevent coups.

In conclusion, this chapter provides empirical evidence confirming that regime
type plays a decisive role in determining coup risk. It also acknowledges the
complex interplay of power dynamics within regimes, offering insights for both
scholars and policy-makers focused on promoting democratic transitions and
political stability. By shedding light on the strategic decisions behind coup
attempts, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of political
instability and its potential solutions, ultimately informing strategies for
promoting more stable and resilient political systems.

## Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Analysis of Power Extensions by Incumbent Leaders {#sec-chapter3}

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter clarifies the concept of autocoups, focusing on their distinct
characteristics, particularly the extension of power by incumbent leaders. By
delineating autocoups from the more encompassing and ambiguous concepts of
self-coups or executive takeovers, which conflate executive power aggrandizement
and power extension, this research offers a refined definition of autocoups.
Building on this conceptual framework, a novel dataset of autocoup events
spanning 1945 to 2023 is introduced. The study employs a mixed-methods approach,
combining three types of qualitative case studies that provide in-depth insights
into the dynamics of autocoups with a quantitative analysis of the determinants
of autocoup attempts and success. This empirical examination demonstrates the
utility of the autocoup dataset for future research. This study contributes to
the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework, a novel
dataset, and a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and motivations underlying
power extensions by incumbent leaders. Furthermore, it explores the implications
of autocoups for democratic resilience, shedding light on the effects of
autocoups on leadership transitions and political stability.

### Introduction

While the study of irregular leadership transitions has predominantly focused on
coups due to their frequency and significant impact, another form—the incumbent
leader's refusal to relinquish power—has received comparatively less attention
despite its importance. Recent decades, particularly since the end of the Cold
War, have witnessed a decline in classic coups and a concomitant rise in this
incumbent retention or overstay type of irregular leadership transition
[@ginsburg2010evasion; @baturo2014; @versteeg2020law].

This chapter aims to redefine and clarify this type of irregular leadership
transition, where leaders overstay their mandated term limits, as an
***autocoup***. Although analyses related to autocoups are not uncommon, the
existing literature exhibits several notable shortcomings:

-   **Terminological ambiguity:** The use of terms like "self-coups",
    "autocoups", "autogolpes", "incumbent takeovers", "executive aggrandizement",
    "overstay", and "continuismo" in different literature lacks clear,
    universally accepted definitions, leading to confusion and inconsistent
    application [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This terminological ambiguity
    hinders accurate analysis and comparison across studies

-   **Limited dataset:** Due to the conceptual ambiguity surrounding autocoups,
    data collection remains in its nascent stages compared to the rich datasets
    available for classic coups.

-   **Methodological gaps:** The study of autocoups has been hindered by a
    limited dataset, resulting in a reliance on in-depth case studies
    [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022] to explore this phenomenon.
    Notably, quantitative analysis has been underutilized in this field, with few
    studies employing statistical methods to examine autocoups.

More importantly, analyses of autocoups are often not integrated with those of
classic coups, despite their interconnected nature. As a distinct category of
coup, autocoups lack a clear and differentiated definition in relation to
traditional coups. Classic coups are typically defined as the complete removal of
incumbent leaders, with a focus on the termination of their tenure. In contrast,
autocoups often focus more on incumbent leaders consolidating power by seizing
control from other state institutions, rather than on extending their tenure. As
a result, coups and autocoups are frequently analysed in isolation. This
separation has led to a dearth of comparative analyses, hindering a more
comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics between these two types of
irregular leadership transitions.

Examining autocoups, particularly in conjunction with classic coups, is essential
for several compelling reasons. Firstly, both coups and autocoups represent
significant and frequent means of irregular leadership transitions, underscoring
the need for a comprehensive understanding of these phenomena. Secondly,
autocoups, much like coups, have a profoundly detrimental impact on governance,
as they undermine the rule of law, erode institutional capacity, and contribute
to democratic backsliding or the personalization of authoritarian power. Thirdly,
successful autocoups, akin to successful coups, create a precedent that increases
the likelihood of future irregular power transitions, thereby perpetuating a
cycle of instability. For instance, since 1945, a striking 62% of leaders who
extended their terms through autocoups in non-democratic countries ultimately met
a tumultuous end, either being ousted or assassinated while in office
[@baturo2019]. Lastly, failed autocoups, similar to failed coups, often
precipitate instability, inciting widespread protests, violence, and even civil
wars, which can have far-reaching and devastating consequences for the affected
country and its citizens.

This chapter addresses these gaps by focusing on autocoups, aiming to clarify
terminology, refine concepts and definitions, enhance data collection, and
explore determinants through empirical analysis, contributing in three key areas:

-   **Conceptual clarification:** The term autocoup will be redefined and
    clarified, with a focus on power extension.

-   **Data collection:** A new dataset of autocoups since 1945 will be introduced
    based on this refined definition.

-   **Empirical analysis:** Utilizing this dataset, a quantitative analysis of
    the factors influencing leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups will be
    conducted.

The structure of this chapter is as follows: Section 2 will review definitions
related to power expansions and extensions, leading to a precise definition of
autocoups. Section 3 will present the new autocoup dataset. Sections 4 and 5 will
explore the determinants of autocoup attempts through case studies and
demonstrate the application of the dataset in empirical analysis. The conclusion
will summarize key findings and suggest directions for future research.

### Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions

A significant limitation in the study of irregular leadership transition is the
conspicuous lack of integration between research on autocoups and classic coups.
Despite both coups and autocoups being crucial mechanisms of irregular leadership
change, the existing literature has largely treated these two phenomena in
isolation, neglecting to explore their interconnectedness and the nuanced
dynamics that govern their occurrence.

This separation is attributable to two primary factors. Firstly, previous
research has often overlooked autocoups as a distinct form of irregular
leadership transition. Secondly, a persistent conceptual ambiguity has hindered
the development of a clear and consistent definition and categorization of
autocoups.

Classic coups are typically characterized by the abrupt and comprehensive removal
of incumbent leaders, focusing on the swift termination of their tenure. In
contrast, autocoups are often defined as events wherein incumbent leaders
consolidate their authority by systematically usurping power from other state
institutions, rather than merely extending their own tenure.

The absence of a clear, differentiated definition of autocoups in relation to
their classic counterparts has exacerbated this divide. While classic coups have
been extensively studied and well-defined, autocoups remain a distinct yet
under-explored category. This definitional ambiguity has resulted in a dearth of
comparative analyses that could illuminate the complex interplay between these
two forms of power subversion.

Integrating the study of autocoups with that of classic coups is crucial for
bridging this analytical gap. Such an approach would offer a more nuanced and
comprehensive perspective on the various mechanisms by which political power can
be subverted or consolidated. By examining these phenomena in tandem, researchers
can better understand the full spectrum of irregular power transitions, from
outright removal to internal power grabs, providing valuable insights into the
nature of political instability and regime change.

To strengthen the analysis of autocoups, a crucial first step is to establish a
clear and consistent terminology, followed by a refinement of the definition of
autocoup to mitigate ambiguity and clarify its distinct characteristics.

#### Terminology

The most prevalent term in autocoup literature is "self-coup," or "autogolpe" in
Spanish [@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017;
@marsteintredet2019]. This term gained academic prominence following Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori's actions in 1992, when he dissolved Congress,
temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree [@mauceri1995;
@cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 astutely points out, the term
"self-coup" can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself, which is
inaccurate since the action typically targets other state institutions or
apparatus.

Another approach to describing coups staged by incumbents involves using terms
with adjectives or modifiers, such as "presidential coup," "executive coup,"
"constitutional coup," "electoral coup," "judicial coup," "slow-motion coup,"
"soft coup," and "parliamentary coup" [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms
can be useful in specific instances, their proliferation often creates more
confusion than clarity. Most of these terms focus on the specific methods
employed by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify the perpetrator,
necessitating further explanation. Moreover, many of these methods could be
employed either by or against executive leaders, further muddying the waters.

A third alternative involves terms like "incumbent takeover," "executive
takeover," or "overstay." Incumbent takeover refers to "an event perpetuated by a
ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or informal
constraints on his/her power" [@baturo2022, p.374], building on earlier research
by [@svolik2014]. Meanwhile, overstay is defined as "staying longer than the
maximum term as it stood when the candidate originally came into office"
[@ginsburg2011evasion, p.1844]. These terms effectively identify the perpetrator
(the incumbent) and/or the nature of the event (overstaying/extending power).
However, they fall short in highlighting the illegality or illegitimacy of these
actions. Consequently, they cannot serve as a direct counterpart to "coup," which
clearly denotes the illegality of leadership ousters, while "takeover" or
"overstay" diminish the severity of the act.

Given that these terms often lack precision, focusing on specific methods rather
than the core act of power usurpation, this study proposes "autocoup" as the most
suitable term for this phenomenon. Unlike other terms, 'autocoup' clearly
identifies the perpetrator and the illegitimate nature of the power grab,
distinguishing it from classic coups while maintaining a parallel structure in
terminology.

#### Definition {#sec-definition}

While precise terminology is undoubtedly crucial, another issue arises with
previous definitions of autocoups: what is the primary emphasis—power expansion,
power extension, or a combination of the two?

Definitions of power expansion and power extension within the field of political
science can often be ambiguous or overlapping, presenting a potential source of
confusion. To ensure greater clarity in the study of autocoups, it is necessary
to distinguish these two distinct conceptual frameworks more clearly:

-   **Power expansion:** This refers to the process by which an incumbent leader
    acquires additional authority or control over state apparatuses beyond their
    original mandate. This may involve centralizing power, reducing checks and
    balances, or encroaching on the authority of other branches such as the
    legislature or judiciary.

-   **Power extension:** This describes situations where a leader prolongs their
    tenure beyond the originally mandated term in office, often through
    constitutional amendments, cancellation of elections, or other means of
    circumventing term limits.

Existing definitions of autocoups or related concepts often suffer from ambiguity
between power expansion and extension, or they focus more on power expansion,
which has several drawbacks.

Firstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align
well with the traditional definition of a coup. A classical coup is clearly
focused on the ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or
restriction on their power. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition
of an autocoup should prioritize the tenure extension of executive leadership.
Power restrictions on incumbents would not be coded as a coup as long as they
remain in office. Similarly, an executive leader acquiring more power from other
branches could be coded as power aggrandizement but not an autocoup, as long as
they step down when their term expires.

Secondly, emphasizing power expansion in autocoups often neglects the ultimate
purpose of incumbents. It is irrational for an incumbent to expand executive
power only to pass the powerful role to future leaders. Although the term
"self-coup" gained prominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which
initially involved seizing power from other institutions, it is important to note
that Fujimori ultimately extended his term limits through constitutional
amendments. The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term,
which he won in April 1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his
supporters in Congress passed a law of "authentic interpretation" that
effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000, which he won amid
suspicions and rumors. However, he did not survive the third term; in 2000,
facing charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took
refuge in Japan [@ezrow2019].

Thirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be
challenging. As @cameron1998a defined, a self-coup is "a temporary suspension of
the constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who rules by
decree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to ratify a
political system with broader executive power" (p. 220). However, defining
"broader executive power" is inherently problematic and disputable.

Therefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should
prioritize power extension as its core characteristic. This approach is
straightforward and easy to identify in practice. In most cases, autocoups
involving power extension also involve power expansions as their prerequisite and
foreshadowing.

Based on these criteria, I define **an autocoup as the illegitimate extension of
an incumbent leader's term in office beyond the originally mandated limits**.
This definition emphasizes the core characteristic of power extension while
acknowledging the potential for power expansion as a related phenomenon:

-   **Leadership Focus**: This definition refers to the actual leaders of the
    country, regardless of their official titles. Typically, this would be the
    president; however, in some cases, such as in Germany, the primary leader is
    the premier, as the president serves as a nominal head of state.

-   **Primary Characteristic**: While the primary characteristic of an autocoup
    is extending the term in office, this definition does not exclude instances
    of power expansion. Both aspects can coexist, but the extension of the term
    is the central element.

-   **Illegitimacy**: Autocoups, by their nature, subvert legal norms and
    established leadership transfer mechanisms. No matter how legitimate they
    claim to be, their illegitimacy is not beyond a reasonable doubt as long as
    the incumbents are the direct beneficiaries. This critical aspect will be
    explored further in Section 3.

By clarifying these definitions, this study aims to provide a more precise and
consistent framework for understanding and analysing autocoups, thereby enhancing
the clarity and rigor of research in this field.

### Introduction to the autocoup dataset

#### Defining the scope

Classifying political events as autocoups often involves addressing borderline
cases. To maintain consistency and avoid ambiguity, this study adopts a broad
coding approach: All instances of incumbents extending their original mandated
term in office are coded as autocoups, regardless of the apparent legality of the
extension.

This approach is justified because truly legitimate amendments to power
transition institutions should apply only to subsequent leaders, not the
incumbent. Even when extension procedures appear legal, the legitimacy is
questionable when the incumbent is the direct beneficiary.

#### Classifying autocoups {#sec-classify}

To maintain consistency, autocoups are categorized based on several key factors.

-   **Methods employed**: Specific strategies used by incumbents (e.g.,
    constitutional amendments, election cancellation).

-   **Degree of legality**: Extent of deviation from established legal norms.

-   **Duration of extension**: Length of time the incumbent remains in office
    beyond designated term limits.

-   **Outcomes**: Whether the autocoup attempt succeeds or fails.

This study primarily focuses on the methods employed, while coding for other
aspects when information is available.

##### Evasion of term limits {.unnumbered}

Evasion of term limits is a common tactic employed in autocoups. Incumbents often
resort to seemingly legal manoeuvres to extend their hold on power. These
manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through
various means. The incumbents may pressure legislative bodies (congress) or
judicial institutions (Supreme Court) to reinterpret existing term limits, amend
the constitution to extend terms, or even replace the constitution altogether.
This might also involve popular vote through referendums, or a combination of
these approaches. The extension can range from a single term to indefinite rule.

These manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through
various means.

-   **Changing term length:** Incumbents might lengthen the official term
    duration (e.g., from 4 to 6 years) to stay in office longer, even if the
    number of allowed terms remains unchanged. Examples, in the dataset, include
    Presidents Dacko (CAR, 1962), Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and Pinochet (Chile,
    1988).

-   **Enabling re-election:** This approach involves incumbents modifying legal
    or constitutional frameworks to permit themselves to run for leadership
    again, despite initial restrictions. These restrictions might include
    prohibitions on re-election, bans on immediate re-election, or term limits
    that the incumbents have already reached. An illustrative example is
    President Menem of Argentina in 1993, who leveraged this tactic to extend his
    tenure.

-   **Removing term limits altogether:** This approach was implemented by
    President Paul Biya of Cameroon in 2008. Biya, who had been in power since
    1982, successfully pushed for a constitutional amendment that abolished
    presidential term limits. This change allowed him to run for re-election
    indefinitely, effectively opening the possibility for him to rule for life.

-   **Declaring** **leader for life:** This differs from removing term limits as
    the leader still faces elections (although potentially rigged or
    uncontested). An example is Indonesia's President Sukarno, who attempted to
    declare himself president for life in 1963 (ultimately unsuccessful).

These methods are often used in combination. Initially, the duration of a term is
extended, followed by amendments to allow re-election, then the removal of term
limits, and finally, the declaration of the leader for life. For example, Haitian
President François Duvalier amended the constitution in 1961 to permit immediate
re-election and then declared himself president for life in 1964.

##### Election manipulation or rigging {.unnumbered}

Election manipulation or rigging is the second most commonly used tactic to
extend an incumbent's tenure.

-   **Delaying or removing elections:** Delaying or removing scheduled elections
    without legitimate justification is a frequent method used by incumbents to
    maintain power. For instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye delayed
    general elections until 1969 after assuming power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan
    President José Eduardo dos Santos suspended elections throughout his rule
    from 1979 to 2017.

-   **Refusing unfavourable election results:** Incumbents may refuse to accept
    unfavourable election results and attempt to overturn them through
    illegitimate means. For example, President Donald Trump of the United States
    refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and tried to overturn
    them.

-   **Rigging elections:** Winning elections with an extraordinarily high
    percentage of votes is highly questionable. This study will code elections
    where the incumbent wins more than 90% of the vote as autocoups. For
    instance, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently won
    elections with over 95% of the vote in multi-party elections since 1996,
    indicating election rigging.

-   **Excluding opposition in elections:** Manipulating the electoral process by
    excluding opposition parties or candidates from participation, effectively
    creating a one-candidate race, clearly signifies an autocoup.

##### Figurehead Installation {.unnumbered}

One strategy employed by incumbents to evade term limits is to install a trusted
associate as a figurehead, allowing the incumbent to maintain de facto control
while formally relinquishing office. This can be achieved through the creation of
seemingly subordinate positions, which in reality serve as conduits for the
incumbent's continued influence.

A notable example of this tactic is the 2008 Russian presidential transition.
Confronted with constitutional term limits, President Vladimir Putin hand-picked
Dmitry Medvedev to succeed him as president. Following Medvedev's election, he
appointed Putin as Prime Minister, ostensibly reversing their roles. However,
most observers and analysts concur that Putin continued to wield significant
behind-the-scenes influence, effectively rendering Medvedev a proxy leader.

##### Reassigning supreme authority to a new role {.unnumbered}

This tactic involves an incumbent leader manipulating the constitution or legal
framework to create a new position of power, or elevate an existing one, before
stepping down from their current role. They then strategically take on this new
position, effectively retaining significant control despite appearing to
relinquish power. For example, in 2017, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Prime Minister
of Turkey, spearheaded a constitutional referendum that transitioned the country
from a parliamentary system to a presidential one. This new system concentrated
significant executive power in the presidency. Following the referendum's
approval, Erdoğan successfully ran for the newly established presidency,
effectively retaining control under a different title.

##### One-time arrangement for current leaders {.unnumbered}

This strategy involves special arrangements that extend the term or tenure of
current leaders without altering the underlying institutions. For example,
Lebanon extended President Émile Lahoud's term by three years in 2004 through a
one-time arrangement.

#### Data coding

The autocoup dataset is built upon existing studies and datasets, ensuring a
comprehensive and reliable foundation. @tbl-source outlines the main sources used
for coding the autocoup dataset.

The Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political Leaders' Affiliation
Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded] provide comprehensive data on all leaders
from 1875 to 2023, although our coding only includes autocoups since 1945. These
datasets are invaluable for identifying actual rulers, distinguishing them from
nominal heads of state.

The Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022] integrates data from 11 related
datasets, offering a broad spectrum of cases where leaders significantly reduced
constraints on their power. This dataset includes both power expansions and
extensions, necessitating cross-referencing with Archigos to verify
qualifications for autocoups.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-source
#| tbl-cap: Main Data Sources for Coding the Autocoup Dataset
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

read.csv(here("data/autocoup_source.csv")) |>
  clean_names(case = "title") |>
  gt() |>
  tab_options(
    table.width = pct(100),
    table.align = "center"
  ) |>
  as_raw_html()
```

```{r}
#| label: data-autocoups
#| echo: false

Autocoup <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reddylee/Datasets/main/autocoup_clean.csv")
# nrow(Autocoup)
# nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))
```

In total, `r nrow(Autocoup)` observations were coded, with
`r nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))` overlapping with the candidate data
from Incumbent Takeover. The remaining
`r nrow(Autocoup) - nrow(Autocoup |> filter(!is.na(source)))` events were newly
coded by the author through verification with other sources such as Archigos,
PLAD and news reports.

The main deviation from the Incumbent Takeover dataset arises from excluding
power expansions that do not involve attempts to extend tenure.

The dataset encompasses a total of 14 variables along with the *notes* field.

-   **Country identification:** Country code (*ccode*) and country name
    (*country*) from Correlates of War project [@stinnett2002].

-   **Leader information:** Name of the de facto leader (*leader_name*,coded
    following Archigos and PLAD datasets).

-   **Timeline variables:** Date the leader assumed power (*entry_date*), date
    the leader left office(*exit_date*), date of the significant event marking
    the autocoup (*autocoup_date*), and Start date of the leader's additional
    term acquired through the autocoup (*extending_date*).

-   **Power transition methods:** Categorical variable for how the leader entered
    power (*entry_method*), categorical variable for how the leader exited power
    (*exit_method*), dummy variable indicating regular (1) or irregular (0) entry
    (*entry_regular*), and dummy variable indicating regular (1) or irregular (0)
    exit (*exit_regular*).

-   **Autocoup details:** Key variable capturing methods used to extend power
    (*autocoup_method*) and outcome of the autocoup attempt (*autocoup_outcome*,
    "fail and lose power", "fail but complete original tenure", or "successful").
    For successful coups, the additional term length can be calculated from the
    difference between *exit_date* and *extending_date*.

-   **Data source:** Identifies the dataset source used for coding (*source*).

-   **Additional notes:** Provides context for exceptional cases (*notes*).

There are a few coding challenges and decisions worth mention. For cases where
extensions happen incrementally, the *autocoup_date* reflects a significant event
marking the extension, such as a legislative vote or successful referendum. In
cases where a leader undertook multiple autocoup attempts, details are recorded
in the notes field. Care was taken to differentiate between cases of power
expansion and actual attempts to extend tenure, which required cross-referencing
multiple sources. Determining the success or failure of an autocoup attempt often
required in-depth research, especially for less documented cases.

#### Data descriptions

```{r}
#| label: data_descriptions

country <- Autocoup |>
  distinct(ccode) |>
  summarise(count = n())

autocoup_desc <- Autocoup |>
  summarise(
    attempted = n(),
    succeeded = sum(autocoup_outcome == "Yes"),
    .by = autocoup_method
  ) |>
  arrange(-attempted)
```

The primary coding has identified `r nrow(Autocoup)` autocoup cases from 1945 to
2023, involving `r country$count` countries. This comprehensive dataset provides
a rich source of information for analysing trends and patterns in autocoup
attempts across different political contexts.

@tbl-autocoup_method presents a breakdown of the autocoup methods employed by
leaders:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-autocoup_method
#| tbl-cap: Autocoup methods and success rates (1945-2021)

autocoup_desc |>
  adorn_totals() |>
  mutate(Success_rate = percent(round(succeeded / attempted, 3))) |>
  clean_names(case = "title") |>
  gt() |>
  tab_options(
    table.width = pct(99)
  ) |>
  cols_align(
    align = "center",
    columns = 2:3
  ) |>
  tab_source_note(source_note = md("*Source: Autocoup dataset*"))
```

The most common autocoup method is "enabling re-election", accounting for
`r autocoup_desc$attempted[1]` events. This is followed by "removing term limits"
(`r autocoup_desc$attempted[2]` cases), and then "delaying elections" and
"declaring the leader for life" (each with `r autocoup_desc$attempted[3]` cases).

Autocoups have a success rate of 79%, compared to the 50% success rate of
classical coups. This high success rate can be attributed to several factors:

-   Incumbent Advantage: Leaders already in power have access to resources and
    institutional mechanisms that can be leveraged to their advantage.

-   Gradual Implementation: Unlike sudden coups, autocoups can be implemented
    gradually, allowing leaders to build support and legitimacy over time.

-   Legal Facade: Many autocoup methods operate within a veneer of legality,
    making them harder to oppose openly.

-   Control of State Apparatus: Incumbents often have significant control over
    state institutions, which can be used to facilitate their autocoup attempts.

However, success rates vary significantly across different methods.

-   **100% success rate**: Removing term limits, delaying elections, declaring
    the leader for life, and cancelling elections all have perfect success rates.
    This suggests that once these processes are set in motion, they are difficult
    to reverse.

-   **Lower success rates:** Refusing to accept election results has the lowest
    success rate, with only 1 out of 4 attempts succeeding. Although the sample
    size is limited (only 4 cases in total), this trend might suggest several
    factors at play. These include greater democratic resilience in systems where
    general elections are regularly held, heightened international scrutiny and
    pressure in response to blatant manipulation of election results, and
    stronger domestic opposition to such overt power grabs.

### Determinants of autocoup attempts: Case studies

#### High frequency and success rate of autocoups in post-communist regimes

Our dataset shows a high frequency and success rate of autocoups in
post-communist countries. These nations, formerly communist regimes prior to the
collapse of the Soviet Union, have largely evolved into 'hybrid regimes'
[@nurumov2019], with only a few retaining their communist status. The data
documents 12 cases of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency in these
countries, with only two attempts failing. Examination of these cases highlights
several distinctive characteristics:

-   **Inherited authoritarian systems**: Despite most of these 12 countries
    transitioning from communist to non-communist governments (with the exception
    of China), they retained many authoritarian systems from their communist
    past.

-   **Continuity of former elites**: The transitions did not result in the
    removal or overthrow of previous ruling groups. Instead, former communist
    elites often maintained their positions of power.

-   **Subverted democratic processes**: While general elections and term limits
    were introduced in most of these countries, the legacy of former communist
    regimes frequently led to the circumvention of term limits and manipulation
    of elections [@nurumov2019].

##### Case 1: Lifelong ruler–Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus {.unnumbered}

Alexander Lukashenko, a former member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian
Soviet Socialist Republic, became the head of the interim anti-corruption
committee of the Supreme Council of Belarus following the dissolution of the
Soviet Union. Elected as Belarus's first president in 1994, he has maintained
this position ever since. Initially, the 1994 constitution limited presidents to
two successive terms. However, Lukashenko removed this restriction in 2004.
International monitors have not regarded Belarusian elections as free and fair
since his initial victory. Despite significant protests, Lukashenko has
consistently claimed to win with a high vote share, often exceeding 80% in each
election. This pattern is evident across all five Central Asian countries of the
former Soviet Union, where post-dissolution leaders were typically high officials
or heads of the former Soviet republics who continued their leadership in the
presidency.

##### Case 2: Transferring power to a handpicked successor–Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan {.unnumbered}

Nursultan Nazarbayev served as the first president of Kazakhstan from 1991 until
2019. Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he held de facto leadership
as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. Following
independence, he was elected as the first president and retained office until
2019 through various means, including resetting term limits due to the
implementation of new constitutions. Notably, Nazarbayev did not officially
eliminate term limits but instead created an exemption for the "First President"
[@nurumov2019]. Unlike Lukashenko, who remains the incumbent of Belarus,
Nazarbayev transferred the presidency to a designated successor, Kassym-Jomart
Tokayev, in 2019. However, he retained significant influence as the Chairman of
the Security Council of Kazakhstan until 2022.

#### Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin America

Latin America has a long-standing tradition of maintaining term limit
conventions. Simón Bolívar, the founding father of Bolivia, was initially a
strong advocate for term limits, stating in 1819, "Nothing is as dangerous as
allowing the same citizen to remain in power for a long time... That's the origin
of usurpation and tyranny" [@ginsburg2019, p.38]. Although Bolívar eventually
modified his stance, arguing in his 1826 Constitution Assembly speech that "a
president for life with the right to choose the successor is the most sublime
inspiration for the republican order," term limits became a convention in Latin
America. Approximately 81% of Latin American constitutions between independence
and 1985 imposed some form of term limits on the presidency
[@marsteintredet2019a].

An analysis of cases in Latin American countries reveals two notable patterns.

##### Often successful at breaking non-re-election or non-immediate re-election restrictions {.unnumbered}

Unlike other presidential systems where two terms are more common,
non-re-election or non-immediate re-election used to be prevalent in Latin
America. According to @marsteintredet2019a, non-consecutive re-election was
mandated in about 64.9% of all constitutions between independence and 1985, while
5.9% banned re-election entirely.

However, adherence to these conventions has varied across the region. Since
Mexico introduced non-re-election institutions in 1911 at the start of the
Mexican Revolution, they have remained inviolate [@klesner2019]. Similarly,
Panama and Uruguay have never altered their re-election rules, and Costa Rica has
only experienced a brief period (1897-1913) permitting immediate presidential
re-election since prohibiting it in 1859 [@marsteintredet2019a]. In many other
countries, however, constitutions have been frequently amended or violated.

The pursuit of re-election or consecutive re-election, therefore, has been a
significant trigger for autocoups aimed at power extension in this region. Our
research documents 32 autocoup cases, with over 50% (17 cases) attempting to
enable re-election or immediate re-election, and about 59% (10 cases out of 17)
being successful.

Unlike those who attempt to overstay in office indefinitely, many Latin American
leaders exit after their second term expires. Examples include President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso of Brazil (1995-2003), President Danilo Medina of the Dominican
Republic (2012-2020), and President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras
(2014-2022) [@ginsburg2019; @marsteintredet2019a; @landau2019; @baturo2019;
@neto2019].

##### Failing to further extend tenure {.unnumbered}

This trend does not imply that none of these leaders attempted further
extensions, but rather that most accepted their unsuccessful outcomes without
abusing their power to manipulate the process. While autocoups aimed at securing
one additional term are often successful, attempts to overstay beyond this are
frequently unsuccessful.

In contrast to the previous examples, two contrasting cases illustrate the varied
outcomes of term limit challenges:

-   **Unsuccessful extension – Carlos Menem (Argentina)**: President Menem
    successfully extended his tenure by one term through a 1994 constitutional
    amendment allowing one executive re-election. He was subsequently re-elected
    in 1995. However, his attempt to reset his term count, arguing that his first
    term (1988-1995) should not count as it was under previous constitutions, was
    unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court in March 1999 [@llanos2019]. A
    similar scenario unfolded with President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia (2002-2010)
    [@baturo2019].

-   **Successful extension – Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua)**: In contrast, Daniel
    Ortega, the incumbent president of Nicaragua, successfully extended his
    presidency. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua permitted his
    re-election in 2011. Subsequently, in 2014, the National Assembly of
    Nicaragua approved constitutional amendments abolishing presidential term
    limits, allowing Ortega to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. As
    a result, he has held the presidency since 2007 [@close2019].

#### As common as classical coups: Cases of African countries

Classical coups have been prevalent in Africa, accounting for approximately 45%
of all global coups (219 out of 491 cases) since 1950, involving 45 out of 54
African countries (GIC dataset). While autocoups are less frequent compared to
traditional coups, they maintain a significant presence in Africa. Among 110
documented autocoup cases globally, 46% (51 cases) occurred in Africa, involving
36 countries. Notably, the success rate of autocoups in Africa is over 84% (43
out of 51 attempts), which surpasses both the success rate of classical coups in
the region (roughly 50%) and the global average success rate of autocoups (79%).

Identifying a clear pattern of autocoups in Africa is challenging, mirroring the
complexity observed with classical coups. Various factors have been proposed to
explain this phenomenon:

-   **Natural Resources**: Countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil
    or diamonds, may see leaders more likely to attempt and succeed in extending
    their terms [@posner; @cheeseman2015; @cheeseman2019a].

-   **Quality of democracy**: The quality of democracy is a critical factor
    influencing respect for term limits [@reyntjens2016].

-   **International influence**: International aid or donor influence can play a
    significant role in discouraging attempts at power extension [@brown2001;
    @tangri2010].

-   **Organized opposition and party unity**: The extent of organized opposition
    and the president's ability to enforce unity within the ruling party are
    crucial factors [@cheeseman2019].

Utilizing the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, @cassani2020
highlights human rights abuses and the desire for impunity as main drivers for
incumbents to cling to power. The more authoritarian a leader, the more likely
they are to attempt to break term limits and overstay in office. A leader's
ability to secure the loyalty of the armed forces through public investment
increases the chances of success in overstaying.

Despite both coups and autocoups being prevalent, there has been a noticeable
shift since the end of the Cold War in 1991: Traditional coups have decreased in
frequency while autocoups have become more prevalent.

This trend can be partially attributed to the introduction of multi-party
elections in Africa in the 1990s, which also brought in term limits for
executives [@cassani2020; @cheeseman2019]. Before 1991, personal or military rule
was more common, and term limits were less frequent. Post-1991, with more term
limits introduced, challenges to these limits have increased. However, it is
crucial to note that this increase in challenges does not necessarily imply that
violations are more common than adherence to term limits, because total power
transitions have increased compared to the past.

### Empirical analysis: An example of utilizing the autocoup dataset

The autocoup dataset enables quantitative analyses beyond traditional case
studies. This section provides a straightforward example of how to utilize this
dataset effectively. To analyze the determinants of autocoup attempts, I employ a
probit regression model. This approach differs from the double probit model with
sample selection used in [Chapter @sec-chapter2] for coup attempts and success
analyses. Instead, I use two separate probit models. Due to the high probability
of success in autocoups, they do not exhibit the typical sample selection
characteristics that necessitated the use of a sample selection model in our
earlier analysis of traditional coups.

#### Dependent variables

-   **Autocoup attempt**: Binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt
    occurred (1) or not (0) during the tenure of an incumbent leader.

-   **Autocoup success**: Binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt
    was successful (1) or failed (0), conditional on an autocoup attempt
    occurring.

#### Independent variables

The selection of independent variables are consistent with the coup analysis in
[Chapter @sec-chapter2], plus the population size and the leader's age.

-   **Population size:** To account for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,
    we consider the log of the population size. This transformation helps in
    managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The
    data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its
    influence on power transitions. Larger populations may present more
    governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting
    the stability and longevity of a leader's tenure.

-   **Leader's age:** The age of the leader is included as an additional variable
    in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with
    leadership strength. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks,
    and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain
    power. This data is sourced from Archigos and PLAD datasets.

Unlike the analysis of coup determinants, which could theoretically occur in any
given year, I assume that an autocoup happens only once during an incumbent
leader's tenure, as a successful autocoup negates the need for another attempt.
However, this assumption does not always reflect reality, as leaders might
attempt further extensions or try again after a failed attempt. For simplicity, I
overlook these possibilities in our analysis.

Therefore, in our probit model, the unit of analysis for autocoups is the entire
tenure of a leader, rather than a country-year. I establish a base year for the
variables: for leaders who staged an autocoup, we use the year of their first
attempt as the base year; for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, I use the
middle year of their tenure as the base year.

```

@tbl-autocoupmodel summarizes the findings from the probit regression models
based on our analysis of the determinants of autocoup attempts and their success.

Model 1, which examines autocoup attempts, reveals only one significant predictor
besides the constant term. Among the regime types, personalist regimes
significantly increase the likelihood of autocoup attempts, all else being equal.
This suggests that leaders in personalist regimes are more prone to attempt to
extend their power through autocoups compared to leaders in democratic regimes
(reference regime). Leaders in dominant-party and military regimes, however, show
no significant difference in the likelihood of attempting an autocoup compared to
democratic leaders.

The model for autocoup success (Model 2) shows similar dynamics. Personalist
regimes again have a strong positive and significant effect on the success of
autocoups compared to democratic leaders. Dominant-party regimes also show a
positive and marginally significant effect. However, a detailed examination
reveals that about half of the successful autocoups in dominant-party regimes (9
out of 20) exhibit a personalist style, such as "party-personal-military"
regimes.

This outcome is logical since personalist leaders are typically much more
powerful than other types of leaders, making them more inclined and capable of
overstaying in power.

Other factors play an insignificant role in determining the attempts and outcomes
of autocoups. This aligns with our conclusions on the determinants of classic
coups. Both coups and autocoups are significantly affected by power dynamics. As
power transitions involve the struggle between seizing and maintaining power, the
balance of power status quo inevitably matters in both coups and autocoups. This
also explains the high success rate of autocoups. Compared to power challengers,
incumbents are in an obviously advantageous position. Incumbent leaders can use
state power to their benefit, which is difficult to counteract. Even the abuse of
power is often unchecked under a powerful leader's rule.

The empirical analysis of autocoups yields significant implications for
real-world politics. In particular, the high overall success rate of autocoups
highlights the vulnerability of democratic institutions to gradual erosion by
incumbent leaders. The threshold for ousting or impeaching an incumbent leader
through constitutional means is exceptionally high, with success often requiring
more than a simple majority and substantial support across various sectors.
Resorting to illegal means, such as a coup, presents even greater challenges due
to high costs, severe consequences, and a low likelihood of success.

Conversely, political dynamics, whether in democracies or autocracies, tend to
favour incumbents even when they act unconstitutionally. Incumbents can leverage
state resources to achieve their political ambitions, benefiting from a high
probability of success and minimal consequences in case of failure. This
asymmetry in power and risk creates a concerning scenario: for incumbents who do
not respect constitutional institutions, the opportunity to launch an autocoup
appears sufficiently low-risk to warrant an attempt.

### Summary

This chapter conducts a thorough and comprehensive analysis of autocoups, with a
specific focus on political events where incumbent leaders illegitimately extend
their tenure in power. By refining the existing definition and distinguishing
autocoups from related concepts such as "self-coups," "autogolpes," and
"executive takeovers," this research introduces a novel dataset that catalogues
autocoups from 1945 to 2023. This refined definition and the accompanying dataset
enable the study to broaden its analysis of irregular leadership transitions.
While traditional analyses often concentrate on the abrupt termination of tenure
through coups, this research expands the scope to include the irregular extension
of tenure through autocoups. This approach provides a more comprehensive and
nuanced understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting the various mechanisms by
which incumbent leaders can subvert democratic processes to maintain their power.

The findings reveal that personalist regimes are significantly more likely to
experience autocoup attempts and succeed in these attempts compared to
democracies. Dominant-party systems, often exhibiting personalist
characteristics, also show an association with successful autocoups. While regime
type significantly influences autocoups, other factors appear less impactful,
mirroring classic coups where the balance of power is a more essential
determinant. The high success rate of autocoups can be attributed to the inherent
advantages incumbents possess, such as control over or abuse of state power and
the difficulty of removing or impeaching them through legal or illegal means.

However, several limitations warrant consideration for future research. Firstly,
the definition of an autocoup requires further commentary and discussion to gain
wider acceptance in the academic community. Despite efforts to maintain
objectivity, some coding decisions may involve subjective judgments, particularly
in borderline cases. Secondly, due to the nature of autocoups, which are less
frequent than classic coups (491 coups versus 110 autocoups during the same
period), the quantitative analysis cannot be conducted as a country-year variable
as in coup studies. This raises the issue of choosing an appropriate base year
for the analysis, which requires further discussion and potentially sensitivity
analyses.

Despite these limitations, this research significantly enhances our understanding
of the mechanisms and motivations behind autocoups, contributing to the
literature on political stability and democratic resilience. The findings
highlight the vulnerability of political systems, particularly democracies, to
erosion from within by incumbent leaders.

Future studies could build on this work by employing the dataset to explore more
nuanced power dynamics or examine the long-term impacts of these events on
political systems. Particularly fruitful areas for investigation include the
relationship between autocoups and democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown,
and the personalization of power. Additionally, comparative analyses between
autocoups and traditional coups could yield insights into the evolving nature of
power consolidation strategies in different political contexts.

In conclusion, this study enhances our understanding of autocoups by clarifying
terminology, refining definitions, and providing a comprehensive dataset. Future
research could explore the relationship between autocoups and democratic
backsliding, democratic breakdown, and the personalization of power.

## Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival: A Comparative Analysis of Coup-installed and Autocoup Leaders

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter examines the relationship between the methods of power acquisition
and the tenure of leaders who ascend to power through unconventional means, with
a particular focus on coup-installed and autocoup leaders. The central hypothesis
posits that the mode of accession has a profound impact on leadership longevity.
Utilizing Cox proportional hazards and time-dependent Cox models, this study
provides robust empirical evidence of disparate survival times between these two
leader types. The findings reveal that, on average, coup-installed leaders are
2.23 times more likely to be ousted from power than autocoup leaders, all else
being equal. These results have far-reaching implications for political stability
and democratic processes, suggesting that the perceived low costs and high
rewards associated with autocoups may incentivize incumbents to prolong their
tenure through this means, potentially contributing to democratic erosion. This
research makes a notable contribution to the academic literature by offering
nuanced insights into the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and
enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between power acquisition
methods and leadership longevity.

\newpage

### Introduction

The enduring fascination with the longevity of political leaders has sparked
extensive research in political science, with scholars seeking to understand why
some leaders maintain power for decades while others are ousted in a matter of
months or even days. However, a specific subset of leaders—those who ascend to
power through coups or extend their tenure through autocoups—has received
relatively limited attention. Examining the tenures of these leaders is crucial,
as it sheds light on the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and their
implications for political stability and democratic processes.

In contrast to leaders who attain power through conventional means, those who
rise through irregular channels, such as coups or autocoups, present more complex
and intriguing cases for study. The Archigos dataset highlights the prevalence of
irregular power transitions. Between 1945 and 2015, over half of leaders who
assumed power irregularly also exited irregularly, a rate significantly higher
than that of leaders who accessed office through regular channels.

Coup-installed and autocoup leaders constitute a substantial portion of these
irregular cases. The Archigos dataset notes that of 374 leaders who exited
irregularly, 246 (65.8%) were ousted through coups. Furthermore, research by
@frantz2016 demonstrates that coup-related exits account for approximately
one-third of all exits in autocracies, surpassing any other transition type.
Additionally, the autocoup dataset, introduced in [Chapter 3](#sec-chapter3),
documents 110 autocoup attempts between 1945 and 2023, of which 87 were
successful.

```{r}

  summarise(
    avg = round(mean(survival_year), 1),
    .by = group
  )
```

Measuring the tenure of coup-installed and autocoup leaders poses challenges due
to the inherent irregularity and uncertainty of their positions. Nevertheless, a
comparative analysis reveals that leaders who extend power through autocoups tend
to have longer average post-autocoup tenures (approximately `r avg$avg[1]` years)
compared to coup-installed leaders (approximately `r avg$avg[2]` years),
suggesting a potential tenure gap of over five years.

  xlab = "Survival Years",
  # title = "Survival Curves of overstay and coup-installed leaders",

)
```

A preliminary log-rank test in survival analysis, as illustrated in @fig-logrank,
demonstrates a statistically significant difference between the tenures of
autocoup and coup-installed leaders. The survival curve for autocoup leaders
consistently exceeds that of coup-installed leaders, indicating longer survival
times and a reduced risk of ouster for autocoup leaders.

This study posits that the method of accession significantly influences
leadership longevity. Coup-installed leaders likely confront greater challenges
to their rule, resulting in shorter average tenures compared to autocoup leaders.
The analysis, employing Cox proportional hazards and time-dependent Cox models,
supports this hypothesis, demonstrating that autocoup leaders generally
experience longer tenures than coup-installed leaders.

This research offers two primary contributions to the field. First, it highlights
an understudied factor in leadership survival analysis: the impact of the method
of accession to power. The findings suggest that leader survival is influenced
not only by ruling strategies but also by the initial method of acquiring power.
Second, by employing survival models, this study provides empirical evidence of
the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and coup-installed
leaders. This insight may explain the increasing prevalence of tenure extensions
through autocoups since 2000, as more incumbents observe and potentially emulate
successful precedents.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a
comprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context
for this research. Section 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of
coup and autocoup leaders. Section 4 outlines the methodology and data used,
including the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of
leadership longevity. Section 5 presents the analysis findings and a detailed
discussion of the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes by synthesizing key
takeaways and exploring their broader implications for political stability and
democratic processes.

### Literature review

The longevity of political leaders, which varies widely across different regimes,
countries, and historical periods, has been a longstanding focus of research in
political science. This field can be divided into two interconnected areas:
regime survival and individual leader survival, which are distinct but related
concepts. Regime survival focuses on the endurance of political systems, such as
monarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures, while leader
survival concerns the duration of individual leaders' time in office.

Political survival patterns vary widely across different systems. Parliamentary
democracies (e.g., Japan, United Kingdom) often experience prolonged periods of
party dominance coupled with frequent leadership changes. Similarly, communist
regimes (e.g., China) typically demonstrate enduring party rule with more
frequent leadership transitions. Presidential systems (e.g., United States) and
many military regimes tend to exhibit more frequent changes in both ruling party
or junta and leader.

The existing literature on leader survival is extensive and multifaceted. Some
studies explore specific mechanisms influencing leadership longevity within
particular regimes, such as democracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies
[@davenport2021]. Others aim to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks
explaining leader survival across different political systems
[@buenodemesquita2003]. While a universal theory remains an aspirational goal,
the complexities of leadership survival across diverse regime types present
significant challenges.

Power transition mechanisms vary substantially across different types of regimes,
particularly between democracies and autocracies. Autocratic systems often
feature closed leadership selection processes, restricted to a narrow pool of
individuals. While some autocracies may hold elections, significant barriers to
entry for legitimate challengers typically persist. The opacity of selection
processes in autocracies makes it difficult to assess genuine levels of public
support compared to democracies. Conceptualizing selectorates or winning
coalitions, as proposed by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes problematic in many
autocratic contexts.

Given these complexities, focusing research on specific regimes or leader types
may be more fruitful. The study of irregular leaders, such as those who ascend to
power through coups or extend their tenures through autocoups, offers a
compelling avenue for research due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties
surrounding their leadership trajectories.

Two primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.
The first emphasizes objective factors and resources, such as personal competence
[@yu2016], societal stability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999;
@williams2011], natural resource endowments [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012;
@wright2013], and external support [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017]. The
second focuses on subjective factors and strategies, including political
policies, responses to opposition, and tactics for consolidating power
[@gandhi2007; @morrison2009; @escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].

Coups, a significant aspect of irregular leadership transitions, have received
considerable scholarly attention. Research has examined coup prevention
strategies [@powell2017; @sudduth2017; @debruin2020]. Studies have explored the
impact of coups on leadership and the subsequent actions of coup leaders
[@sudduth2017, @sudduth2018, @easton2018].

However, a significant gap remains in the literature regarding the comparison of
leadership survival between coup-installed and autocoup leaders. This study aims
to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership
survival for these two leader types.

By focusing on the comparison between coup-installed and autocoup leaders, this
study seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of political survival
in irregular leadership transitions. This approach may offer valuable insights
into the complex dynamics of leader longevity across different political
contexts.

### Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-installed leaders

Studying leadership survival in political systems is challenging due to the
opacity and diverse mechanisms of power transitions. These challenges, however,
underscore the significance of this research, as it illuminates understudied
dynamics in political leadership. Although the survival of political leaders is
complex and varied, some patterns do emerge. Leaders of similar types often
exhibit similar characteristics, allowing for meaningful analysis.

#### Key definitions and scope

Before delving into the comparison, it is essential to clarify several key
terminologies:

-   **Coup and autocoup**: These terms are defined consistently with previous
    chapters to ensure clarity and consistency throughout the study.

-   **Tenure length threshold**: To ensure meaningful analysis, this study
    focuses on leaders with substantial periods in power, applying a six-month
    threshold to both autocoup and coup-installed leaders. This criterion filters
    out ephemeral leadership episodes, allowing for a more robust examination of
    survival dynamics.

-   **Autocoup leader**: An incumbent leader who successfully employs
    illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. This
    definition encompasses various methods of power consolidation that circumvent
    established democratic processes or constitutional limits.

-   **Coup-installed leader**: The individual who assumes power after a
    successful coup, regardless of their role in the coup itself. This broad
    definition allows for the inclusion of both coup instigators and those
    selected to lead post-coup, providing a comprehensive view of leadership
    dynamics following forceful regime change.

This study focuses on comparing the post-autocoup tenure of autocoup leaders with
the post-coup tenure of coup-installed leaders. This comparative approach is
motivated by the relevance and similarity of these leader types in terms of
illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. By examining these parallel yet
distinct paths to power, we can gain insights into the factors that influence
leadership longevity in irregular leadership transitions.

#### Challenges in power consolidation

Both autocoup and coup-installed leaders confront distinct challenges in
consolidating their power, primarily stemming from the varying intensity of
issues related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. This disparity
creates an uneven playing field in terms of power dynamics, placing
coup-installed leaders at a significant disadvantage. @tbl-leaders provides a
comparative overview of the main features of autocoup and coup-installed leaders,
highlighting these key differences.

\elandscape

##### Illegitimacy {.unnumbered}

While both types of leaders suffer from a legitimacy deficit, the nature and
perception of this deficit differ significantly:

-   **Coup-installed leaders**: Their illegitimacy is blatant and unambiguous,
    stemming from the overt and often violent seizure of power. This overt act
    undermines pre-existing norms and institutions, generating immediate domestic
    and international condemnation.

-   **Autocoup leaders**: In contrast, autocoup leaders employ a more subtle and
    deceptive strategy, manipulating legal processes and institutions to create a
    façade of democratic legitimacy. This veneer of legality, while often thin,
    can provide a degree of cover and buy time for consolidating power.

##### Uncertainty {.unnumbered}

The irregular paths to power for both types of leaders create uncertainty about
the longevity of their rule and the mechanisms of their eventual departure.
However, the levels and sources of this uncertainty differ significantly.

-   **Coup-installed leaders:** These leaders face a trifecta of uncertainties.
    First, the immediate aftermath of a coup often involves a struggle for power
    within the junta or ruling coalition, creating ambiguity about who will
    ultimately consolidate control. Second, the tenure of coup-installed leaders
    is inherently precarious, subject to internal rivalries, popular uprisings,
    or counter-coups. Third, the lack of established succession mechanisms
    further amplifies uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the transfer of
    power and potentially triggering future instability.

-   **Autocoup leaders:** While not immune to uncertainty, autocoup leaders
    generally present a clearer picture. The question of who will rule
    post-autocoup is largely settled, as the incumbent retains power.
    Furthermore, many autocoup leaders openly aspire to extend their rule
    indefinitely or incrementally, attempting to establish a sense of permanence.
    This perceived stability, whether real or manufactured, can contribute to a
    more predictable political environment, at least in the short term.

##### Instability {.unnumbered}

The awareness of shaky legitimacy and persistent uncertainty inevitably breeds
insecurity and a sense of crisis, forcing both autocoup and coup-installed
leaders to prioritize stabilization measures. However, the nature and intensity
of these challenges differ:

-   **Coup-installed leaders:** These leaders face the daunting task of rapidly
    reshaping power dynamics, often resorting to purges and crackdowns to
    eliminate potential adversaries and consolidate control. This process of
    dismantling existing structures and building new ones generates significant
    instability, potentially alienating former allies and triggering resistance
    from various segments of society. The need to appease powerful actors both
    domestically and internationally further limits their options, forcing them
    into compromises that can undermine their authority and long-term stability.

-   **Autocoup leaders:** In contrast, autocoup leaders often benefit from a
    degree of continuity in regime personnel and institutions. This relative
    stability allows them to implement changes gradually, minimizing disruptions
    and mitigating potential backlash. While they may still face opposition, they
    are less likely to confront immediate and existential threats to their rule,
    providing them with more time and leverage to consolidate power.

By understanding these contrasting challenges, we can better appreciate the
relative advantages and disadvantages faced by autocoup and coup-installed
leaders. This comparative perspective provides a nuanced framework for analyzing
the strategies these leaders employ to consolidate power and navigate the
perilous terrain of irregular leadership transitions.

#### Empirical evidence and hypothesis

Empirical evidence substantiates the disadvantage faced by coup-installed
leaders, revealing a complex interplay between historical precedent, power
consolidation challenges, and leadership longevity. This section presents key
data points and introduces the central hypothesis guiding this study.

Data analysis shows a significant correlation between the frequency of coup
attempts in a country and the likelihood of future coups. Notably, over a third
of coups have occurred in the top ten countries with the most attempts since 1950
(As shown in @tbl-coups). This pattern suggests a self-reinforcing cycle of
political instability, where each successful coup increases the probability of
subsequent attempts, creating an environment of persistent uncertainty for
coup-installed leaders.

The disparity in leadership longevity between autocoup and coup-installed leaders
is starkly illustrated by survival data. As depicted in @fig-logrank, the average
survival period following an autocoup is approximately five years longer than
that of coup-installed leaders. This substantial difference in tenure length
underscores the divergent challenges faced by these two types of leaders in
maintaining their grip on power.

The distinct challenges faced by autocoup leaders and coup-installed leaders in
consolidating power create a self-perpetuating cycle that significantly
influences their tenure length:

-   Coup-installed leaders: Face greater legitimacy challenges and internal
    instability; Struggle to attract and retain strong support; More vulnerable
    to internal and external challenges; Shorter average tenures reinforce
    perception of instability.

-   Autocoup leaders: Often benefit from a veneer of legitimacy and a stronger
    initial position; Better able to consolidate power and attract supporters;
    Face less immediate threat of overthrow; Longer average tenures contribute to
    perception of stability.

This cycle suggests that the initial method of power acquisition or extension has
far-reaching consequences for a leader's ability to maintain their position over
time.

Based on these observations and the theoretical framework outlined earlier, I
propose the following hypothesis:

***H4-1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups
are more likely to survive longer extended tenure compared to coup-installed
leaders.***

This hypothesis encapsulates the expected outcome of the divergent challenges and
advantages faced by autocoup and coup-installed leaders. By testing this
hypothesis, I aim to quantify the impact of the method of power acquisition or
extension on leadership longevity, contributing to a more nuanced understanding
of political survival in contexts of irregular transitions.

### Research design

This section employs survival analysis to test the hypothesis that autocoup
leaders have longer survival times in office compared to coup-installed leaders.
This study uses Cox models to analyze the survival tenures of autocoup and
coup-installed leaders, controlling for various factors that may affect their
time in office.

#### Methodology: Survival analysis

Two Cox models will be employed to analyze the survival tenures of coup-installed
and autocoup leaders:

-   **Cox proportional hazards (PH) model**: This model uses only the variables
    present at the entry year, without considering changes over time.

-   **Time-dependent Cox model**: This model accounts for variations in
    time-dependent control variables such as economic performance and political
    stability.

The Cox model is preferred over the Kaplan-Meier model because it enables the
estimation of the impact of multiple factors. Although it does not directly
estimate the duration of tenure, it assesses the hazard rate associated with
being ousted from power. This approach captures different facets of the same
phenomenon: as a leader's cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their
probability of survival in office decreases.

#### Data and variables

The dependent variables include survival time and end point status:

-   **Survival time:** Survival time refers to the duration of a leader's tenure,
    measured in days. For coup-installed leaders, the survival time begins on the
    day they assume power through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time
    starts on the expiration date of their original legitimate term. For example,
    Russia's president Vladimir Putin assumed power in 2000 and, after serving
    two terms, stepped down in 2008. However, he remained in a powerful position
    as the prime minister and hand-picked Dmitry Medvedev to succeed him as
    president, while continuing to control the power behind the scenes. In this
    case, Putin's survival time begins in 2008, marking the start of his
    post-autocoup tenure. The survival time concludes on the day the leader
    finally exits office, applicable to both coup-installed and autocoup leaders.

-   **End point status:** This variable indicates the manner in which the
    leader's tenure concluded, categorized as follows:

    **0 = Censored:** This status is assigned to leaders who leave office through
    regular means other than being ousted. This includes leaders transferring
    power to their designated successors, leaving office as their terms expire,
    losing in general elections, voluntarily leaving office due to health issues,
    or dying of natural causes.

    **1 = Ousted:** This status is assigned to leaders who are forced to leave
    office. This includes leaders resigning under pressure, being ousted by coups
    or other forces, or being assassinated.

The key independent variable is the leader type, which categorizes leaders into
two distinct groups:

-   **Group A = Autocoup leader**: Leaders who extend their tenure through
    autocoups.
-   **Group B = Coup-installed leader**: Leaders who assume power through coups.

This variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the
basis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.

The data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from the
autocoup dataset introduced in this study, Archigos, and PLAD.

Control variables include economic performance, political stability, population
size, and the leader's age, which are consistent with the autocoup analysis in
[Chapter @sec-chapter3].

)
```

Both models showed a statistically significant relationship between leadership
type and the hazard of removal from power. Since time-dependent Cox model use the
control variables which change over time, I interpret the main findings based on
time-dependent model.

Coup-installed leaders were found to have a hazard ratio of 2.23 in the
time-dependent model compared to autocoup leaders (reference group), assuming all
other variables in the model are held constant. This suggests that coup-installed
leaders face a significantly greater risk of removal from power compared to
autocoup leaders. At any given time during their tenure, coup-installed leaders
are 2.23 times more likely to be ousted from power compared to autocoup leaders,
all else being equal in the model.

The control variables perform differently in the two models. Economic level (GDP
per capita) exhibits statistically significant effects in both models. In the
time-dependent model, the hazard ratio of 0.95 indicates that for each unit
increase in GDP per capita (measured in units of \$10,000), the hazard (or risk)
of being ousted at any given time is reduced by 5%, assuming all other variables
in the model are held constant.

GDP growth trend demonstrates a more substantial effect in reducing the risk of
coups. Specifically, a 1 percentage point higher economic growth trend is
associated with an 80% reduction in the risk of being ousted, although this
effect is only statistically significant at the 10% level. This suggests a
possible trend where positive economic performance might mitigate the risk of
removal from power, but the evidence is not robust enough to confirm this
conclusively.

Political stability, as measured by the violence index, shows that a 1-point
increase in the index correlates with an 11% higher risk of being ousted.
However, this effect is also only statistically significant at the 10% level,
indicating a weaker but potentially important relationship between increased
violence and the risk of removal from office.

The survival curves in @fig-coxSurv displays the survival rates for both types of
leaders, highlighting the differences in their survival curves. Both the Cox PH
model and the time-dependent Cox model yield similar results. Notably, the
survival curve for coup-installed leaders has a significantly lower trajectory
than that of autocoup leaders. The steeper drop at the early stage for
coup-installed leaders indicates they are more likely to be ousted shortly after
assuming power. Additionally, the survival curve for coup-installed leaders
crosses the median survival line much earlier (about 3,000 days) than that of
autocoup leaders (about 8,500 days). This disparity suggests that autocoup
leaders tend to remain in power for longer durations than their coup-installed
counterparts.

@fig-coxHR displays the hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals
for the variables incorporated in the Cox model. Both the Cox Proportional
Hazards (PH) model and the time-dependent model produce similar plots,
reinforcing the robustness of the findings. Key points to note include:

-   The closer the hazard ratio (represented by the dots) is to 1, the less
    impact the variable has on the risk of being ousted. A hazard ratio of 1
    indicates no effect.

-   The whiskers extending from the dots represent the 95% confidence intervals.
    If these whiskers cross the vertical blue line at 1, it indicates that the
    variable is not statistically significant at the 5% level.

-   The hazard ratio for coup-installed leaders is significantly greater than 1
    and statistically significant at the 5% level. This indicates that
    coup-installed leaders face a substantially higher risk of being ousted
    compared to autocoup leaders.

-   Most other variables have hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting that a
    one-unit increase in these variables does not significantly affect the risk
    of being ousted.

-   Although the hazard ratio for GDP growth trend is considerably less than 1 in
    the time-dependent model, indicating a potential protective effect, it is not
    statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it is statistically
    significant at the 10% level, suggesting that better economic performance may
    help to consolidate the rule of the incumbents to some extent, albeit the
    evidence is not as strong.

#### Assessing the proportional hazards assumption

Assessing the proportional hazards assumption is crucial for the validity of the
Cox model results. To evaluate this, we used the chi-square test based on
Schoenfeld residuals to determine whether the covariate effects remain constant
(proportional) over time. Although the Cox PH model violates the proportional
hazards assumption, our primary analysis relies on the time-dependent Cox model,
which does not show strong evidence of violating the proportional hazards
assumption for any covariate. The global p-value of 0.416 is much greater than
the 5% significance level, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption is
reasonably met for the time-dependent Cox model.

### Summary

This chapter explores the survival durations of political leaders who come to
power through unconventional means, specifically focusing on coups and autocoups.
Based on the hypothesis that the mode of accession affects leader tenure, I use
survival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a
time-dependent Cox model, to investigate this phenomenon. The findings suggest
that autocoup leaders tend to have longer tenures than coup-installed leaders.

Empirical analysis reveals a significant disparity in tenure length: leaders who
assume power via autocoup remain in office for an average of 11 years, compared
to just 5.6 years for those installed by coups. Moreover, the time-dependent Cox
model indicates that coup-installed leaders are 2.23 times more likely to be
ousted from power at any given time compared to their autocoup counterparts, all
other factors being equal. These findings underscore the importance of
understanding the autocoup as a mechanism through which leaders extend their rule
by manipulating legal frameworks and weakening institutional constraints.

The implications of these findings are profound. The relative ease and potential
rewards of an autocoup could incentivize more leaders to resort to this method of
power retention, particularly in fragile democracies or transitioning regimes.
Consequently, democratic backsliding may become more prevalent, as autocoups
erode democratic institutions and undermine constitutional norms.

This study contributes significantly to the literature on political leadership
survival by showing that the mode of accession has a substantial impact on leader
tenure, an aspect that has received limited attention in previous research.
Methodologically, this work advances the field by applying robust survival
analysis techniques, including both Cox models, to provide a nuanced
understanding of the dynamics that influence leadership stability.

However, the study is not without limitations. The analysis relies on an autocoup
dataset that was collected and coded by the author, a relatively novel concept in
the academic sphere. As the understanding and recognition of "autocoup" as a term
continue to evolve, future research should refine and expand the dataset.
Incorporating additional cases and cross-referencing with other forms of
irregular leadership transitions would contribute to a more comprehensive view of
political survival under such conditions.

In conclusion, this chapter highlights the need for more refined approaches to
studying political tenure and irregular power retention. By offering valuable
insights into the dynamics of political stability and the risks associated with
non-democratic leadership transitions, this research emphasizes the importance of
continued investigation into the complex relationships between power, legitimacy,
and survival in political leadership.

## Coups, Autocoups, and Democracy

### Abstract {.unnumbered}

This chapter explores the impact of autocoups on political institutions, drawing
comparisons with traditional coups through an analysis of changes in Polity
scores. I contend that, first, incumbent leaders frequently consolidate power by
undermining established institutions in anticipation of an autocoup, resulting in
a decline in Polity scores even prior to the event. Second, unlike coups, which
produce mixed outcomes regarding democratization, autocoups almost invariably
lead to democratic backsliding or authoritarian entrenchment, as they are
specifically designed to dismantle institutional checks, enabling leaders to
maintain power for significantly longer periods than those installed via coups.

Employing a country-fixed effects model and utilizing datasets on both autocoups
and coups, this study reveals that Polity scores decline both preceding and
following an autocoup, while coups tend to trigger an immediate decrease that may
allow for some degree of democratic recovery over time. These findings underscore
the divergent political trajectories associated with coups and autocoups. This
research not only addresses a critical gap in the empirical analysis of autocoups
but also significantly raises awareness within academic and policy-making circles
regarding their potential adverse effects, including democratic backsliding and
further authoritarian deterioration.

### Introduction

In the preceding chapters, I clarified the definition of an autocoup, introduced
a novel dataset on autocoups, conducted empirical analyses on the determinants of
autocoup attempts, and compared the post-event survival times of leaders
established through coups versus autocoup leaders. A natural follow-up question
emerges: What are the broader impacts of autocoups? Specifically, from a
political science perspective, how do autocoups affect the process of
democratization?

As previously noted, due to the absence of a widely recognized dataset on
autocoups, most existing discussions on their impact have relied on case studies
[@baturo; @baturo2022]. To move beyond case-specific analyses and adopt a more
systematic and comparative approach, this chapter aims to pioneer empirical
research on the democratic consequences of autocoups. The first objective of this
chapter, therefore, is to examine whether autocoups reinforce authoritarianism,
promote democratization, or have no significant effect on political regimes.

Given the conceptual and empirical connections between coups and autocoups,
another key objective is to compare their respective effects on democratization.
While both events disrupt existing political orders, their immediate and
long-term consequences may vary significantly. Understanding these distinctions
is essential for evaluating their broader implications.

To address these questions, this study leverages data from a widely recognized
coup dataset alongside a newly compiled dataset on autocoups. Employing a
fixed-effects model, it evaluates their effects on democracy, as measured by the
Polity Index. The findings reveal that both coups and autocoups lead to an
immediate decline in democratic levels. However, coups have a more pronounced
negative short-term impact. Notably, three years after these events, democracies
affected by coups tend to show significant recovery, whereas those experiencing
autocoups exhibit no meaningful improvement.

This study offers two significant contributions to the field of political
science. First, it provides the inaugural empirical analysis of the impact of
autocoups on democratization, effectively addressing a critical gap in the
existing literature. Second, by directly comparing the effects of coups and
autocoups, this research highlights autocoups as a distinct phenomenon that
demands increased scholarly inquiry and policy focus.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 analyzes the
impact of autocoups on democratization, by comparing the effects with traditional
coups. Section 3 outlines the research design, methodology, and variables used in
this study. Section 4 presents and interprets the empirical findings, followed by
a discussion of their implications. Finally, Section 5 concludes by summarizing
the key results and exploring their significance for understanding and mitigating
the occurrence of autocoups.

### Impact of autocoups on political change

According to the definition in @sec-definition, an autocoup refers to an
incumbent leader extending their tenure in power beyond the originally mandated
limits, whether through legal or illegal means. While the leader may assume a
different title or position, the individual in power remains unchanged.
Therefore, unlike traditional coups, an autocoup does not result in real
leadership turnover, elite restructuring, or regime change. In other words, the
fundamental ruling structure remains intact.

This distinction has important implications. Since regime change rarely occurs
following an autocoup, its impact on politics cannot be assessed using
conventional methods. Typically, studies on coups and democratization measure
their effects by estimating the probability of regime transition—either from
autocracy to democracy or vice versa—as seen in previous research on coup
outcomes [@thyne2014; @derpanopoulos2016; @miller2016]. However, this approach is
not suitable for autocoups, as they do not directly trigger regime transfers.

Although autocoups rarely lead to formal regime change, this does not mean they
have no impact on political dynamics. In fact, they inevitably shape political
trajectories in various ways and, on occasion, can even lead to significant
transformations. Therefore, a more appropriate method for assessing the political
impact of autocoups is to analyze democratic indices, such as those measured by
Polity5 [@p1]. The Polity Score, ranging from -10 (full autocracy) to +10 (full
democracy), captures gradual shifts in political regime characteristics rather
than abrupt transitions. Thus, even if an autocoup does not result in a formal
regime change, subtle shifts in political openness and institutional constraints
can still be assessed by examining variations in Polity scores before and after
the event. This approach has also been employed in previous studies [@dahl2023].

Although autocoups may not lead to significant regime change, their impact on
democratization should not be overlooked. However, their influence differs from
that of traditional coups in at least two key ways.

#### **The pre-emptive effects of autocoups on political dynamics**

First and foremost, unlike coups, which are marked by clear, decisive events—such
as the removal of a leader—autocoups typically unfold gradually, through
incremental steps rather than a singular, dramatic event. Incumbent leaders
seeking to extend their tenure often lay the groundwork well in advance before
executing their final move to remain in power. To reduce resistance and
opposition, they engage in extensive preparation, which may include purging
officials, suppressing political opposition, cracking down on dissent and
protests, and restricting press freedom. Without such measures, an autocoup might
face strong internal resistance, and in the worst case, provoke a backlash that
not only derails the leader’s attempt to extend their rule but also results in
their immediate removal from office.

However, once an incumbent successfully secures an extension of their rule,
continued repression is not always necessary. On the contrary, some leaders relax
political pressure to ease internal dissent and mitigate opposition from external
actors. This adaptive approach helps maintain stability after the autocoup is
complete.

As a result, the primary impact of autocoups on political change is often
reflected in shifts in political scores before the final stage of the autocoup is
enacted. Once the process is completed, further shifts may be minimal. In
contrast, coup plotters, unlike incumbents, lack the ability to influence
political institutions beforehand, meaning their impact on politics is often felt
in the aftermath rather than before the event.

This distinction is evident in empirical cases of autocoups.

One of the most frequently cited examples of an autocoup is Peru’s 1992 case, in
which President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the
1979 Constitution, and ruled by decree until November of that year, when a
*Democratic Constituent Congress* was elected to draft a new constitution
[@cameron1998]. However, these moves did not immediately grant Fujimori a longer
tenure in office.

Under the 1979 Peruvian Constitution, immediate presidential re-election was
prohibited. To bypass this restriction, Fujimori initiated a constitutional
overhaul, leading to the adoption of a new constitution in 1993, which permitted
re-election. Consequently, he secured a second term in 1995 [@baturo2019].

An analysis of Peru’s Polity5 scores during this process reflects these political
changes. Upon taking office in 1990, Peru’s Polity score was 8, remaining
unchanged in 1991. However, a dramatic shift occurred in 1992, when Fujimori
dissolved Congress, causing the Polity score to plummet from 8 to -4.
Interestingly, when he formally extended his rule by amending the constitution in
1993, the score rebounded slightly to -1. This -1 score remained unchanged
throughout Fujimori’s tenure until 2000, indicating a lack of further
institutional transformation after the constitutional amendment.

A similar pattern emerges in Belarus under Alexander Lukashenko. Upon assuming
office as president in 1994, Belarus had a Polity5 score of 8. However, in 1995,
when Lukashenko moved to hold a referendum—defying opposition in the Supreme
Council and threatening to suspend its activities—the score dropped sharply to 0.
Following the 1996 referendum, which extended his term by two additional years,
Lukashenko officially overstayed his tenure. Consequently, the Polity5 score
further declined to -7 in 1996, where it has remained ever since, despite two
additional term extensions [@ash2014; @baturo].

These cases illustrate a broader pattern: the impact of autocoups on political
change is often reflected before the final stage of the autocoup is enacted,
whereas the impact of coups tends to materialize afterwards, as have been fully
discussed by previous studies.

Based on this analysis, I propose the first hypothesis:

> *H1*: Autocoups primarily shape political change in advance, whereas coups
> typically drive political change only after they are executed.

#### **The singular nature of autocoups**

Secondly, in contrast to the ambiguous nature of coups [@dahl2023], the impact of
autocoups on political change rarely contributes to democratization.

The influence of coups on democratization has been extensively examined in
existing literature. Some scholars argue that coups—and even the mere threat of
them—can act as catalysts for democratization. One argument suggests that coups
deliver a political "shock" that may create opportunities for liberalization that
would not have otherwise materialized [@thyne2014]. In a critical examination,
@derpanopoulos2016 questioned the role of coups in promoting democracy, engaging
in multiple rounds of debate with @miller2016. More recently, @dahl2023 further
explored this ongoing discussion, arguing that both democratic and autocratic
transitions are likely to follow a coup, with popular mobilization playing a
decisive role in shaping post-coup trajectories.

A frequently cited example of a “pro-democracy coup” occurred in February 2010,
when Nigerien troops ousted President Mamadou Tandja after he extended his rule
autocratically. The Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy (CSRD) took
control, pledging democratic reforms. Their actions were widely celebrated, with
both citizens and political opposition viewing the coup as an opportunity to
restore democracy. The CSRD fulfilled its commitment by overseeing free and fair
elections in 2011, resulting in Mahamadou Issoufou assuming the presidency
[@miller2016].

While the debate on the democratic consequences of coups remains ongoing, it is
evident that their impact is not uniform. In contrast, autocoups almost never
lead to democratic transitions, nor do they even marginally enhance political
freedoms. This stems from the intrinsic nature of autocoups, which disrupt the
established process of political leadership transition, particularly term limits.

Term limits are constitutional provisions that restrict the maximum duration a
leader can remain in office. They play a crucial role in both democracies and
autocracies by preventing the excessive concentration of power and ensuring
political stability. In democracies, term limits promote accountability,
leadership renewal, and reduce the risks of corruption and authoritarian
entrenchment. In autocracies, when enforced, they can curb indefinite rule,
mitigate succession crises, and provide rare opportunities for political
transitions. However, without term limits, leaders can entrench themselves in
power, undermining institutions and hindering political progress.

As shown in @tbl-autocoup_method in Chapter 3, autocoups are executed through
either façade legal mechanisms or blatantly illegal methods. This includes
amending or disregarding term limits, delaying or cancelling elections, rigging
electoral outcomes, or outright refusing to accept election results. While many
autocoups maintain a veneer of legality, their defining characteristic is the
violation of term limits, which are intended as safeguards against prolonged and
unchecked rule.

As previously discussed, before an incumbent leader formally overstays their
term, they often inflict significant damage on political institutions.
Furthermore, to secure their prolonged rule, they are unlikely to fully restore
political freedoms even if they temporarily ease political repression once they
have consolidated power.

Case studies from Peru and Belarus illustrate how autocoups lead to a decline in
Polity scores, reflecting democratic backsliding. However, most autocoups occur
in already autocratic regimes where Polity scores are low. This aligns with
trends observed in coups, which also primarily occur in autocracies.

For instance, in China’s 2018 constitutional amendment, Xi Jinping abolished
presidential term limits, effectively allowing himself to remain in power
indefinitely[^1]. However, China’s Polity score remained unchanged at -7 before
and after the amendment. This pattern is common in autocratic regimes with Polity
scores below -6, as they already lack significant democratic features, leaving
little room for further decline.

While most autocoups occur in low-Polity-score countries, some have taken place
in relatively democratic settings, where the Polity score remains stable despite
term limit extensions. This is particularly evident in Latin America, where
presidents have amended "no immediate re-election" rules to allow for a second
consecutive term, but voluntarily stepped down afterwards. Examples include:
Argentina (1993), Polity score remained at 7; Brazil (1997), Polity score
remained at 8, Colombia (2004), Polity score remained at 7. In these cases,
leaders extended their tenure within a structured political framework without
further dismantling democratic institutions [@baturo2019].

Across all cases—whether in Peru, Belarus, China, Argentina, Brazil, or
Colombia—there is no instance where a Polity score increased following an
autocoup. In the autocoup dataset which I introduced in Chapter 3, only four
cases—Guinea-Bissau (1988), Burkina Faso (1997), Congo-Brazzaville (2001), and
Lebanon (2004)—saw minor increases in Polity scores, but the changes were
insignificant.

Thus, unlike some coup leaders who justify their actions by claiming to restore
democracy (as seen in Niger’s 2010 case), leaders who execute autocoups lack any
democratic justification. If their true intention were to advance democracy, they
would transfer power peacefully rather than violate term limits.

Based on this analysis, I propose the second hypothesis:

> *H2*: Autocoups are more likely to entrench autocracy than coups.

### Methodology and variables

#### Methodology

As discussed earlier, autocoups are less likely to result in full regime
transitions—either from democracy to autocracy or vice versa. Therefore, it is
inappropriate to assess their effects solely based on regime transitions or
changes that cross a critical threshold. Instead, this study examines political
changes through fluctuations in Polity5 scores.

Unlike coup analysis, which primarily focuses on post-event effects, this study
examines both pre-event and post-event impacts of autocoups. Specifically,
pre-event effects are measured by the change in Polity5 scores three years before
the autocoup compared to the year of the autocoup, expressed as:

$Polity_t - Polity_{t-3}$

Post-event effects are measured by the change in Polity5 scores three years after
the autocoup compared to the year of the autocoup, expressed as:

$Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t$

The three-year window is chosen for two key reasons. Pre-event political changes
typically occur incrementally, as incumbents consolidate power gradually over
several years rather than through a single, abrupt action. Post-event analysis
focuses on medium-term effects rather than short-term shocks, as autocoups rarely
trigger immediate regime transitions and instead reinforce existing political
structures. Short-term fluctuations may be too minor to capture meaningful
institutional change empirically.

To estimate how political institutions change before and after autocoups, I
employ a linear model with country-case fixed effects. For pre-event effects, I
analyze attempted autocoups, since before the event, no one knows whether the
autocoup will succeed or fail.

For post-event effects, I analyze only successful autocoups for three reasons:
The majority of autocoups succeed (87 out of 110 cases); failed autocoups tend to
produce immediate political shocks, rather than medium- or long-term effects;
failed autocoups are often followed by major disruptive events, such as coups,
insurrections, or mass protests, making it difficult to isolate their impact. For
example, in Niger's case, a failed autocoup in 2009 was followed by a coup in
2010, creating overlapping political effects. In contrast, successful autocoups
provide a clearer analytical framework, as their effects are less entangled with
other disruptions, allowing for a more systematic assessment of institutional
change.

#### Variables

This study uses a global sample of all country-year data from 1950 to 2020,
applying a linear model to examine the effects of autocoups on political change.
The dependent variable is the change in Polity scores, while the main independent
variable is autocoups. The dataset includes approximately 7,500 observations.

The dependent variable measures political change using three-year differences in
Polity scores. Model 1 (Pre-event effects): $Polity_t − Polity_{t − 3}$. Model 2
(Post-event effects): $Polity_{t+3} - Polity_t$.

The Polity score ranges from -10 (full autocracy) to 10 (full democracy). Some
values in the dataset, such as -66, -77, and -88, represent transitional regimes
or special periods. To prevent excessive data loss, I replace these values with
the closest valid Polity scores. This approach ensures that the model captures
all changes in Polity scores, rather than focusing solely on transitions that
cross a democratic threshold.

The main independent variable is autocoups, as introduced in Chapter 3. The
dataset includes110 attempted autocoups (used for pre-event analysis) and 87
successful autocoups (used for post-event analysis). For pre-event analysis, the
autocoup variable is binary, where: 1 indicates the presence of an attempted
autocoup and 0 indicates no autocoup event.

For post-event analysis, I apply decay functions to account for both immediate
and delayed effects, following the methodology of @dahl2023. To assess the
persistence of autocoup effects, I consider a half-life specification of five
years, analysing the impact from the autocoup year ($y_t$) to four years after
($y_{t+4}$).

I also include traditional coups as a secondary independent variable for two
reasons. Comparative significance: It is essential to compare the effects of
autocoups and coups. Overlapping events: In many cases, coups and autocoups are
interconnected, as autocoups can trigger coups. Distinguishing their effects is
necessary for a clear empirical analysis.

As in previous chapters, I use the coup dataset from @powell2011. To maintain
consistency, I apply the same methodological approach to coups as to autocoups:
Binary coding for pre-event effects and decay function coding for post-event
effects.

Control variables include economic performance, political stability, and
population size, all of which have been analysed in previous chapters.
Additionally, I incorporate two dummy variables. The first,
**"**non_democracy**,"** accounts for regime type, recognizing that
non-democratic regimes with Polity scores below -6 have limited room for further
decline, while democracies with scores above 6 are less likely to experience
significant increases. The second, **"**cold_war**,"** follows the approach used
in prior studies on the impact of coups on democratization [@thyne2014;
@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023] and accounts for the Cold War period. This
variable captures the observable trend of declining Polity scores from the 1960s
to 1990, followed by an upward shift after 1990.

### Results and discussion

#### Pre-event effects

Initially, I analyse the trajectory of Polity scores leading up to these events.
As presented in @tbl-demomodel, columns 1 and 2 display the empirical results for
pre-event effects, examining changes over two years (model 1) and three years
(model 2) prior to the event. Consistent with the first hypothesis, Polity scores
exhibit a significant decline in the 2–3 years preceding an autocoup. Notably,
this downward trend is both more pronounced and statistically significant for
autocoups compared to traditional coups.

```

Column 1 examines the pre-event changes, specifically the difference between
Polity scores at time $t-1$ and $t-3$ ($Polity_{t-1} - Polity_{t-3}$). The
results reveal a statistically significant decrease in Polity scores prior to
autocoups. On average, Polity scores decline by 0.45 in the two years before an
autocoup, holding other factors constant. In contrast, no significant changes are
observed before traditional coups, indicating that pre-coup periods do not
measurably affect democratization levels.

Column 2 assesses the cumulative impact from three years prior to the event year,
calculated as $Polity_{t} - Polity_{t-3}$. As previously discussed, the year of
an autocoup or coup witnesses a substantial shock to political institutions.
Consequently, both types of events result in a decline in Polity scores relative
to three years earlier. However, the negative effect of autocoups is more severe.
Polity scores decline by an average of 1.53 in the three years leading up to an
autocoup, compared to 1.27 for coups, all else being equal. This disparity
reinforces our hypothesis that autocoups have a more detrimental pre-event effect
on democratic institutions as incumbents overextend their legitimate tenure.

#### Post-event effects

Columns 3 and 4 present the empirical results for post-event effects, analysing
changes in Polity scores following attempted (column 3) and successful (column 4)
autocoups.

Column 3 examines the impact of attempted autocoups. The results indicate that
attempted autocoups do not have a statistically significant effect on Polity
scores. This contrasts with coup attempts, which lead to an average increase of
0.48 in Polity scores over three years, all else being equal.

Column 4 evaluates the impact of successful autocoups. In contrast to attempted
autocoups, successful autocoups demonstrate a significant negative effect on
Polity scores, with an average decline of 0.33 over three years, holding other
factors constant. Conversely, successful coups continue to exhibit positive
effects on democratization, resulting in an average increase of 0.72.

These findings yield several key insights. First, while both successful and
attempted coups influence Polity scores, only successful autocoups produce
statistically significant effects—and exclusively in a negative direction.
Second, the impact of coups on democratization is more nuanced. Although
post-coup Polity scores may improve, the pre-coup period often involves
significant democratic backsliding. My models indicate that, on average, the
democratic gains following a coup fail to offset the losses incurred before it.

#### Effects of control variables

To ensure robust results, I incorporated several control variables into the
models. While economic trends and political violence do not exhibit statistically
significant effects on Polity scores, other factors warrant further discussion.

The impact of the Cold War is relatively straightforward. As outlined in the
research design section, global democracy experienced a general decline during
the Cold War period. Consistent with this trend, all four models indicate that
the Cold War era is associated with an average decrease of 0.23 in Polity scores.

The effects of GDP per capita, population size, and regime type, however, present
a more complex pattern. Counter-intuitively, higher GDP per capita correlates
with lower Polity scores, whereas non-democratic regimes and larger populations
correspond with positive changes in Polity scores. This pattern may be explained
by considering baseline differences between democracies and non-democracies. In
established democracies, Polity scores are already high, leaving limited room for
further increases. These countries also tend to have higher GDP per capita and
lower birth rates, further reinforcing stability in their democratic scores. In
contrast, non-democracies start from lower Polity scores, providing greater
potential for upward movement. Given that authoritarian regimes often exhibit
weaker economic performance and higher population growth rates, their Polity
scores may increase as they undergo political transitions or reforms.

Taken together, these results support both hypotheses. First, the primary effects
of autocoups on Polity scores manifest before the events occur. Second, whereas
coups have ambiguous consequences for democratization, the effects of autocoups
are unidirectional—consistently negative.

#### Robustness tests

To assess the sensitivity of my key findings to model specifications, I conduct a
series of robustness tests. The results indicate that the findings remain
consistent across these variations.

First, I compare the effects of autocoups over a period ranging from one to five
years after the event. The results show that the effects of coups are positive
and statistically significant throughout all five years, with a general trend of
increasing magnitude as time progresses. In contrast, the effects of autocoups
are negative across all five years but reach statistical significance only three
years after the event. This finding aligns with the earlier hypothesis: autocoups
never contribute to an increase in Polity scores.

```

Second, I refine the treatment of autocoups by replacing the decay effects of
autocoups with a dummy variable that distinguishes between attempted and
successful autocoups. Additionally, I disaggregate the ‘Non-democracy’ category
into specific regime types—democracy, dominant-party, military, monarchy, and
personal—consistent with the analysis of coup determinants, setting democracy as
the reference category.

Columns 1 and 2 in @tbl-demomodel2 examine the effects of attempted autocoups,
measured two and three years after the event, respectively, while Columns 3 and 4
focus on successful autocoups. As in previous models, these adjustments do not
alter the core findings across all four models. However, while they lead to
differences in regression coefficients, the results consistently show that Polity
scores decline following autocoups in all models, in contrast to the increase
observed after coups.

Comparing Columns 3 and 4 in @tbl-demomodel2 and @tbl-demomodel, it becomes
evident that replacing the decay factor for autocoups and coups with a dummy
variable significantly amplifies the estimated effects—nearly doubling them. This
result aligns with expectations, as the decay factor distributes the influence of
events over subsequent years, whereas the event dummy captures their impact
exclusively in the year of occurrence.

Furthermore, @tbl-demomodel2 reveals distinct regime-specific variations.
Military regimes exhibit the largest increase in Polity scores, followed by
monarchies and personalist regimes, with dominant-party regimes showing the
smallest but still statistically significant positive effect compared to
democracies. This finding corroborates the results in Chapter 2, which indicate
that military and personalist regimes are more prone to coups. The analysis in
this chapter proves that Polity scores increase significantly following coups.

### Summary

This chapter examines the impact of autocoups on political institutions,
particularly in contrast to coups, by analysing their effects on changes in
Polity scores. It tests two central hypotheses: first, that unlike coups, the
effects of autocoups on Polity scores manifest primarily before the event,
indicating that leaders consolidate power in anticipation of their autocoups; and
second, that while coups produce ambiguous effects—sometimes leading to
democratization and other times reinforcing authoritarianism, as suggested by
previous literature—autocoups consistently result in democratic backsliding or
authoritarian entrenchment.

To evaluate these hypotheses, the chapter employs multiple robustness checks,
including varying time horizons, alternative model specifications, and different
variable treatments. A key finding is that Polity scores begin to decline in the
years leading up to an autocoup, underscoring a pre-emptive process of
authorization. In contrast, coups initially cause a sharp drop in Polity scores
due to the shock of leadership change, but over time, scores often rise,
suggesting that in some cases, coups can contribute to an improvement in the
level of democracy. These findings highlight the fundamentally different
political trajectories triggered by coups and autocoups.

The implications of these results are significant for both academic research and
political practice. While coups have long been a focal point of democratization
studies, this chapter argues that autocoups demand equal, if not greater,
attention due to their systematic role in reversing democratic progress. Unlike
coups, which can sometimes serve as catalysts for political reform, autocoups
almost always reinforce authoritarianism, weakening institutions and eroding
democratic governance. This underscores the urgent need for scholars and
policy-makers to closely monitor the conditions that enable autocoups and their
broader consequences for democratic stability.

Methodologically, this chapter contributes to the study of political transitions
by demonstrating the importance of pre-event trends in analysing regime change.
It also highlights the necessity of distinguishing between different types of
irregular power transitions when assessing their long-term effects. While the
findings reinforce the study’s core arguments, they also raise questions for
future research—particularly regarding leader survival. As shown in Chapter 4,
autocoup leaders tend to survive in power for nearly 11 years on average, while
coup-installed leaders last only about 5 years. This suggests that coups and
autocoups not only differ in their immediate effects but also have distinct
long-term political consequences.

In conclusion, this chapter strengthens the argument that autocoups are a
critical yet under-explored mechanism of authoritarian survival, one that
warrants further investigation to fully understand its implications for global
democratization and authoritarian resilience.

## Conclusion

### Main findings

This study provides critical insights into the dynamics and implications of
irregular power transitions, with a specific focus on coups and autocoups. The
research illuminates the complex interplay between incumbents and challengers
vying for power, yielding three key findings.

-   **Coup attempt determinant**: The expected success rate significantly
    influences the likelihood of a coup attempt. This success rate is largely
    determined by the balance of power between incumbent leaders and challengers,
    which varies by regime type. Notably, the findings show that military regimes
    are approximately 277.7% more likely, and personalist regimes 94% more
    likely, to experience coups compared to dominant-party regimes, all else
    being equal.

-   **Autocoup concept and dataset**: I introduce a refined concept of
    "autocoup", defined as an incumbent leader's refusal to relinquish power as
    mandated. We present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events
    from 1945 to 2023, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups.
    Case studies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset's utility for
    quantitative research.

-   **Leader longevity**: Survival analysis techniques reveal clear differences
    in leader longevity between coup-installed leaders and autocoup leaders. The
    findings reveal that, on average, coup-installed leaders are 2.23 times more
    likely to be ousted from power than autocoup leaders, all else being equal.

### Policy implications

The examination of irregular power transitions and leadership survival offers a
crucial perspective on the interrelated phenomena of democratic backsliding,
breakdown, and autocratic intensification. The findings of this study provide
logical explanations for several political trends:

-   **Global democracy regression:** This study elucidates why global freedom has
    declined for the 18th consecutive year. Irregular power transitions, whether
    through coups or autocoups, inherently violate democratic norms and disrupt
    the trajectory toward stable democracies.

-   **Within-regime democratic erosion:** The research explains why democratic
    backsliding often occurs within regimes [@mechkova2017], rather than through
    regime change. Democracies are becoming less liberal and autocracies less
    competitive, particularly due to the prevalence of autocoups since 2000
    [@bermeo2016]. As discussed in Chapter 3, autocoups extend the tenure of
    incumbent leaders without overturning the regime itself.

-   **Rise of autocoups since 2000:** The analysis also clarifies why autocoups
    have been on the rise since 2000. Incumbent leaders possess several strategic
    advantages: firstly, they have a significantly higher probability of success
    due to their incumbent vantages compared to coup plotters. Secondly, the
    consequences of failed autocoups are relatively milder than those for failed
    coup plotters, resulting in lower costs even if they fail. Lastly, leaders
    who manage to extend their rule through an autocoup often enjoy considerably
    longer tenures compared to coup-installed leaders, thus benefiting more
    substantially.

-   **Role of external pressure:** Due to the challenges of internal opposition
    to autocoups, where power is concentrated in the hands of incumbent leaders,
    external pressure from regional or international communities may play a vital
    role in encouraging adherence to constitutional processes of power
    transition. For instance, after the general election in Venezuela on July 29,
    2024, at least nine Latin American countries rejected the election results
    and called for dialogue[^2]. Although this pressure might not be effective in
    every case, it showcases the potential influence of the international
    community in discouraging future autocoup attempts.

### Limitations and directions for future research

While the study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular leadership
transitions, several limitations require further exploration:

-   **Data refinement:** Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach.
    Future research should validate this classification system through additional
    studies and expert evaluations.

-   **Data harmonization:** The current analysis faces challenges due to
    mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup
    datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for
    more robust comparisons.

-   **Democratic backsliding:** While this study establishes a connection between
    irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical
    evidence is needed to solidify this link.

Future research avenues include:

-   **Terminology and data collection:** Refining the "autocoup" concept and
    achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive
    data collection.

-   **Dataset expansion:** Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and
    integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can
    provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.

-   **Power dynamics and long-term impacts:** Utilizing this dataset, future
    studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the
    long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems,
    particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization
    of power.

In conclusion, this study significantly contributes to our understanding of
irregular leadership transitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining
autocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader
longevity, I establish a robust framework for understanding irregular power
transitions and leadership survival. This work deepens our comprehension of
democratic resilience and political stability, providing a foundation for future
research to conduct further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup
dataset and continue refining the framework.
