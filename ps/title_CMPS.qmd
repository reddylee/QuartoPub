abstract: |
  This article provides a critical reexamination of autocoups, an under-explored phenomenon in which incumbent leaders manipulate institutions to extend their tenure. By distinctly separating autocoups from the broader and more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or executive takeovers, the research introduces a refined and more nuanced definition of autocoups. Building on this clarified conceptual framework, the study unveils a novel dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2023, greatly enhancing the empirical foundation for future research. A robust mixed-methods approach is employed, combining three types of qualitative case studies that offer in-depth insights into the dynamics of autocoups, alongside a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the determinants influencing both autocoup attempts and their outcomes. This rigorous empirical inquiry not only underscores the utility and versatility of the new dataset but also makes a significant contribution to the existing body of literature.
