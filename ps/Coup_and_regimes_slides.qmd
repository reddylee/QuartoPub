---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Drawbacks of Previous Studies

-   All the variables used in previous studies focus on pre-coup conditions, with
    no consideration given to post-coup factors.

-   However, coups are high-stakes gambles with an all-or-nothing nature. No coup
    plotters would stage a coup without some assurance of success.

-   Therefore, the expected outcome of a coup attempt is a crucial determinant of
    whether a coup is attempted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes

### Coup success

#### The expected payoff of coups can be represented by the equation: {.unnumbered}

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(U) = p \times B + (1 - p) \times (-C)
\end{aligned}
$$

#### The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the equation, we get: {.unnumbered}

$$
\begin{aligned}
p \times B > (1 - p) \times C
\end{aligned}
$$

#### B and C are difficult to capture and measure, but we can consider them equally significant. Therefore, we can omit them and focus our attention on $p$: {.unnumbered}

$$
\begin{aligned}
p > (1-p)
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r}
coup <- read.csv("https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/powell_thyne_coups_final.txt",
                 sep = "\t")

coups <- coup |>
  summarise(
    `Coup attempted` = n(),
    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coup == 2),
    .by = country
  )
```

```{r}

                                accuracy = 0.1

    columns = 2:3
  ) |> 
  tab_source_note(source_note = md("*Source: GIC dataset*"))
```

@tbl-coups presents the top 10 countries with the highest number of coup
attempts, along with their respective success rates. Notably, the data indicates
that the average success rate of these coup attempts is approximately 50%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### But what does the success rate of coups imply?

-   If we focus on the success rate, we might identify the determinants really
    impact coup attempts and avoid dwelling on less relevant factors.

-   So, what could most significantly influence the success rate of coups? The
    answer lies in the balance of power within the ruling elites.

-   What determines this balance of power? The types of regimes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Regime types and power dynamics

According to @geddes2014 (GWF), autocratic regimes can be categorized into three
broad types based on leadership origins and decision-making factors:

-   **Military Regimes**: A group of military officers controls the regime's
    power structure, including leadership selection and policy formulation.

-   **Personalist Regimes**: Absolute power rests with a single dictator.

-   **Dominant-Party Regimes**: Supreme power resides within the ruling party,
    with the leader acting as its representative and subject to its collective
    leadership.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
#| label: tbl-regimes1

regimes <- REIGN |>
  distinct(reign_cowcode, year, .keep_all = T) |>
  mutate(
    regime_type = case_when(

  tab_source_note(source_note = md("*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*"))
```

@tbl-regimes1 presents the distribution of regime types and their likelihood of
experiencing coups. It is noticeable that military regimes have the highest
likelihood of coups, followed by personalist regimes, with the exception of the
"Other" category.

## Theorey

### Why military regimes are more prone to coups?

A military regime is essentially a temporary and compromise-based regime when a
formal power structure cannot be established.

-   It lacks an institutional arrangement led by a ruling party.

-   It does not have a strongman with overwhelming dominance.

-   Military leaders often do not trust each other, which easily leads to
    disputes and conflicts of interest.

-   Worse still, since each of these military leaders commands their own military
    forces, they tend to resolve conflicts and disputes by force.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why personalist regimes are also prone to coups?

In comparison, personalist dictatorships are slightly better than military
regimes because:

-   There is a strongman who uses their power and charisma to balance various
    factions.

-   If the leader faces severe health issues, dies of illness, natural causes, or
    assassination, the regime is likely to experience turmoil, thereby laying the
    groundwork for potential coups.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hypotheses

> ***H1: The primary determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of
> success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.\
> *** <br> ***H2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are
> more prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party
> regimes are the least likely to experience coups among the three.***

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Design

### Double *probit* with sample selection model

```{r}
#| label: tbl-regimes2
#| tbl-cap: Regime types and coup success since 1950 

coup_by_succeed <- regimes |>
  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |>
  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |>
  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |>
  filter(!is.na(coup),
         coup == 2) |>
  tabyl(regime) |> 
  adorn_totals("row") |> 
  select(regime, succeeded_coup = n) 

coup_regimes <-  coup_by_regime |> 
  left_join(coup_by_succeed) |> 
  mutate(success_rate = percent(succeeded_coup / num_of_coups, accuracy = 0.1))

regime_total |>
  left_join(coup_regimes, join_by(regime_type == regime)) |>
  mutate(regime_type = str_to_title(regime_type),
,
coup_likelihood = percent(num_of_coups / country_year, accuracy = 0.1)) |>
  select(-succeeded_coup) |> 
  clean_names(case = "title") |>
  gt() |>
  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = "bold",
              table.width = pct(100),
              table.align = "center") |>
  tab_source_note(source_note = md("*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*"))
```

@tbl-regimes2 shows the distribution of regime types and their success rates. It
is evident that, although the likelihood of coup attempts varies significantly
across different regime types, their success rates are converging towards 50%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Double *probit* with sample selection model (continued) {.unnumbered}

-   This convergence cannot be due to chance.

-   Coup attempts are self-selected events.

-   Therefore, a double *probit* model with sample selection is more appropriate.

    -   The first stage (selection equation) examines the probability of a regime
        experiencing a coup attempt.
    -   The second stage (outcome equation) evaluates the probability of the
        success of those coups.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Variables

-   **Dependent variables**: Coup attempt and coup success.

-   **Independent variables**:

    -   Regime type
    -   Economic performance:
        -   GDP per capita level
        -   GDP per capita growth trend
    -   Political violence
    -   Number of previous coup attempts
