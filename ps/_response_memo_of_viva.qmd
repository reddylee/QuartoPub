I wish to convey my profound gratitude to Professor Böhmelt and Professor Powell
for their insightful and constructive feedback during my viva examination. Having
thoroughly reviewed the examiners reports and the discussions held during the
viva, I have implemented substantial revisions to address the concerns raised.
This memorandum delineates the modifications made, directly referencing the
feedback provided, and elucidates how these changes have enhanced the thesis in
terms of focus, clarity, and analytical rigour.

### 1. Overview of Revisions

The thesis has undergone significant structural reorganisation, with a refined
scope and strengthened core arguments. The following sections outline the revised
structure and detail the specific amendments made in response to the examiners
comments.

### 2. Revised Thesis Structure

To enhance the analytical focus, as suggested, I have removed the chapter on
classical coup determinants (formerly Chapter 2). This adjustment enables the
thesis to concentrate more directly on autocoups and their comparative dynamics
with coups. The revised structure is as follows:

**Chapter 1:** Introduction

**Chapter 2:** Conceptualising and Analysing Autocoups (expanded from the
original Chapter 3)

**Chapter 3:** Determinants of Autocoup Attempts (developed from a section within
the original Chapter 3)

**Chapter 4:** Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival (revised from the
original Chapter 4)

**Chapter 5:** Coups, Autocoups, and Democracy (new substantive chapter)

**Chapter 6:** Conclusion and Future Research Directions

### 3. Specific Revisions in Response to Examiner Feedback

#### Chapter 2: Conceptualizing autocoup and introducing dataset

**Conceptual Clarification:** The definition of autocoups has been refined to
distinguish them more clearly from broader efforts at executive aggrandisement.
The revised chapter underscores the extension of tenure through
extra-constitutional means and provides a detailed rationale for this
conceptualisation, thereby enhancing theoretical precision.

**Dataset Refinement (Responding to Professor Böhmelt):** Addressing concerns
about potential post-treatment biasspecifically, the inclusion of leaders who
initially assumed power via a coup and later conducted an autocoup—I have
meticulously reviewed the dataset. Cases where leaders entered power through a
coup have been excluded from the autocoup category. Consequently, the dataset
used in the survival analysis has been reduced from 110 to 83 events. While this
reduces the sample size, it significantly enhances the analytical clarity and
validity of the findings by maintaining a strict distinction between
coup-installed and autocoup leaders.

#### Chapter 3: Determinants of autocoup attempts

**Motivations of Personalist Leaders (Responding to Professor Powell):** In
response to the query regarding why personalist leaders might undertake an
autocoup, I have clarified that regime-type coding (e.g., Geddes, Wright, and
Frantz) reflects a leaders tenure and evolution over time. Many personalist
regimes emerge through a process of consolidation following initial entry via
party, military, or democratic means. Autocoups often serve as a pivotal
mechanism in this transformation, enabling leaders to remove constitutional
constraints and entrench their authority. To elucidate this, I have incorporated
case studies, including examples from Russia and Belarus.

#### Chapter 4: Power acquisition and leadership survival

**Inclusion of Non-Coup Leaders as Baseline (Responding to Professor Böhmelt):**
A new baseline category comprising non-coup leadersthose who assumed office
through neither coups nor autocoups, typically via regular constitutional
mechanismshas been introduced. This refinement enhances the coherence of the
survival models and provides a more robust analytical framework for assessing the
effects of different modes of power acquisition.

**Regime Type as a Covariate (Responding to Professor Powell):** Following
Professor Powell's recommendation, regime type has been incorporated as a
covariate in the survival analysis. The revised results indicate that, when
regime type is controlled for, the method of power acquisition (coup versus
autocoup) no longer exerts a statistically significant effect on leadership
survival. This finding aligns with the literature, which underscores the
importance of institutional context in shaping political outcomes, and reinforces
the conclusion that regime type is a critical determinant of leader longevity.

**Impact of Dataset Refinement:** The exclusion of cases involving prior coups
(as detailed in Chapter 2) further clarifies the analysis, enabling a more
precise comparison between autocoup and coup leaders in the context of survival
modelling.

#### Chapter 5: Coups, autocoups, and democracy

**New Substantive Chapter:** In response to recommendations made during the viva,
a new substantive chapter has been incorporated to explore the broader
implications of coups and autocoups for democratic institutions and their
developmental trajectories. Drawing on longitudinal data, this chapter assesses
their impact on democratic quality and institutional stability, as measured by
Polity V scores. By situating these findings within the broader comparative
politics literature, the chapter enhances the thesis’s contribution to scholarly
debates on regime transitions and democratic backsliding.

### 4. Additional Revisions

**Engagement with the Literature:** The literature review, particularly in the
introductory sections, has been expanded and deepened to better contextualise the
research and demonstrate engagement with existing scholarship.

**Stylistic and Formatting Improvements:** Bullet points within the main text
have been reformulated into full narrative paragraphs to enhance the academic
tone and coherence.

**Clarity and Concision:** The entire manuscript has been revised to improve
readability, consistency, and professional presentation.

These revisions have been undertaken to address the feedback provided during the
viva and in the examiners reports comprehensively. They aim to enhance the
coherence, analytical depth, and scholarly quality of the thesis. I am deeply
grateful to Professor Böhmelt and Professor Powell for their rigorous and
detailed assessments, which have significantly strengthened the final manuscript.
Should further clarification or additional revisions be required, I would be
pleased to address them.
