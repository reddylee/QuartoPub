**Dear Professor Böhmelt and Professor Powell,**

Thank you for your insightful feedback and constructive critiques during my viva
examination. I have carefully reviewed your examiner reports and our discussions,
incorporating substantial revisions to address your concerns. This memo outlines
the changes made, directly referencing your feedback and explaining how the
revised thesis enhances focus, clarity, and analytical rigor.

The revisions include a significant restructuring of the thesis, refining its
scope and strengthening its arguments. Below, I detail the new structure and
specific changes made in response to your comments.

### Revised Thesis Structure

To address your feedback, I have removed the chapter on classic coup determinants
(original Chapter 2) to sharpen the focus on autocoups and their comparative
dynamics with coups. The revised structure is as follows:

Chapter 1: Introduction

Chapter 2: Conceptualizing and Analysing Autocoups (Expanded from the original
Chapter 3)

Chapter 3: Determinants of Autocoup Attempts (Expanded from a section within the
original Chapter 3)

Chapter 4: Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival (Revised from the original
Chapter 4)

Chapter 5: Coups, Autocoups, and Democracy (New Substantive Chapter)

Chapter 6: Conclusion and Future Research Directions

### Specific Revisions Addressing Examiner Feedback

#### Chapter 2: Conceptualizing autocoup and introducing dataset

**Conceptual Clarity:** I have refined the definition of autocoups, clearly
distinguishing them from broader power expansion efforts and emphasizing tenure
extension through unconstitutional means. Chapter 2 now includes a detailed
rationale for this conceptualization to enhance theoretical precision.

**Dataset Refinement (Addressing Professor Böhmelt’s Concern):** Professor
Böhmelt, you highlighted potential overlap between coup-installed leaders and
autocoup leaders, which could introduce post-treatment bias in the survival
analysis (Chapter 4). To address this, I conducted a thorough review of the
autocoup dataset, excluding cases where leaders initially assumed power via a
coup. This ensures that the “autocoup leader” category only includes those who
entered power through constitutional means. As a result, the dataset for the
survival analysis was reduced from 110 to 83 events. While this reduces the
sample size, it significantly improves analytical rigor and clarity in
distinguishing coup-installed and autocoup leaders, directly addressing your
concern.

#### Chapter 3: Determinants of autocoup attempts

**Rationale for Autocoups by Personalist Leaders (Addressing Professor Powell's
query):** Professor Powell, you questioned why leaders classified as
“personalist” would stage autocoups to extend tenure. In the revised Chapter 3, I
clarify that the GWF regime type coding reflects a leader’s tenure, which often
evolves over time. Many personalist leaders initially assume power within party,
military, or democratic structures before consolidating a personalist regime.
Autocoups often mark a critical step in this consolidation, removing
constitutional barriers to extend rule and solidify personal control. I have
included case studies, such as leaders in Russia and Belarus, to illustrate how
autocoups facilitate the transition to personalist rule.

#### Chapter 4: Power acquisition and leadership survival 

**Regime Type as Covariate (Addressing Professor Powell's suggestion):**
Following your recommendation, Professor Powell, I incorporated regime type as a
key covariate in the survival analysis models. The revised results indicate that,
when controlling for regime type, the effect of power acquisition method (coup
vs. autocoup) on leadership survival is no longer statistically significant. This
finding aligns with literature emphasizing the role of institutional context in
shaping political outcomes and underscores regime type as a primary determinant
of leader longevity, beyond irregular mechanisms of power acquisition.

**Impact of Dataset Refinement:** The exclusion of overlapping cases from the
autocoup dataset (noted in Chapter 2) enhances the clarity of comparisons between
coup and autocoup leaders in this analysis, ensuring robust results.

#### Chapter 5: Coups, autocoups, and democracy

**New Substantive Chapter:** This new chapter examines the comparative impact of
coups and autocoups on democratic institutions and trajectories. Building on
prior analyses, it provides a comprehensive assessment of how these irregular
transitions affect democratic quality and stability over time, enriching the
thesis’s contribution to the literature.

#### Additional Revisions 

**Literature Engagement:** I have strengthened engagement with existing studies,
particularly in the introductory sections, ensuring comprehensive referencing to
address your feedback on literature integration.

**Formatting and Style:** Bullet points in the main text have been converted to
narrative paragraphs to improve academic flow and coherence.

**Clarity and Concision:** The entire manuscript has been reviewed to enhance
readability, eliminate redundancy, and maintain a professional tone.

These revisions aim to address your feedback comprehensively, enhancing the
thesis’s coherence, analytical depth, and scholarly rigor. I am deeply grateful
for your expertise and rigorous review, which have significantly strengthened
this work. Please let me know if further clarifications or adjustments are
needed.

Sincerely,

Zhu Qi
