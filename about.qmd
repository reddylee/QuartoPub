I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Government at the [University of
Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) (UK). My research primarily focuses on
authoritarian regimes, democratization, international conflict, coups d'Ã©tat, and
political economy.

I hold an MSc in International Economics, Finance, and Development from the
[University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) (UK) and a Master in Economics
from [University of Fudan](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) (China). I also earned a
Bachelor in Economics from the [Southwestern University of Finance and
Economics](https://e.swufe.edu.cn/) (China).
