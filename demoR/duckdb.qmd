## Establish a connection to DuckDB

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)
library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
library(duckplyr)

# to start an in-memory database
con <- dbConnect(duckdb())
# or con <- dbConnect(duckdb(), dbdir = ":memory:")

# to use a database file (not shared between processes)
# con <- dbConnect(duckdb(), dbdir = "my-db.duckdb", read_only = FALSE)
# to use a database file (shared between processes)
# con <- dbConnect(duckdb(), dbdir = "my-db.duckdb", read_only = TRUE)
```

## Load data into DuckDB

### Load data from `R` chunk
```{r}
# write mtcars, from R environment, to duckdb database
dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars) 
# register iris, from R environment, as a view in duckdb
duckdb_register(con, "iris_view", iris) 
duckdb_register(con, "flights", nycflights13::flights)

# read data from local file to duckdb
duckdb_read_csv(con, "gdp", "data/gdp.csv", na.strings = "NA")
```

### Load data from `sql` chunk
```{sql connection=con}
create table gdp2 as
select * from read_csv('data/gdp.csv')
```

### Show tables in DuckDB
- list tables in `R` chunk
```{r}
dbListTables(con) 
```

- list tables in `sql connection` chunk

```{sql connection=con}
show tables
```

## Query data from DuckDB

### Oder of query execution

![](../fig/sql_query_order.webp) 

Please visit [SQL Query Order](https://lukianovihor.medium.com/sql-order-of-query-execution-8c7cd926400) for more information.

### View the whole table
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * FROM gdp
```
### More complex queries
```{sql connection=con}
select * from mtcars
where hp > 100
order by -hp
```
We can omit `Select *` in the query in `duckdb` as it is the default.

```{sql connection=con}
from mtcars
where hp > 100
order by -hp
```
We can anti-select columns in the query in `duckdb` as shown below.

```{sql connection=con}
from flights
select * exclude (year, month, day)
where month = 1 and
day = 1
order by dep_delay desc
limit 10
```

More complex queries can be written in `sql` chunk as shown below.

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM (
   SELECT
     tailnum,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    AVG(distance) AS dist,
    AVG(arr_delay) AS delay
  FROM flights
  GROUP BY tailnum
) q01
WHERE (count > 20.0) AND (dist < 2000.0) AND (NOT((delay IS NULL)))
limit 10
```

## Save outcome of query into R environment

```{sql connection=con, output.var="top10_delayed_planes"}
SELECT tailnum, AVG(distance) AS dist, AVG(arr_delay) AS delay
FROM flights
WHERE month = 1
GROUP BY tailnum
HAVING COUNT(*) > 20
ORDER BY delay DESC
LIMIT 10
```

The outcome of the query is saved in the R environment as `top10_delayed_planes` and we can call it in R chunk as shown below.
```{r}
top10_delayed_planes |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_options(table.width = pct(90),
              column_labels.font.size = 16,
              column_labels.font.weight = "bold",
              column_labels.text_transform = "capitalize") |>
  opt_row_striping()
```

## Disconnect from DuckDB

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)
```
