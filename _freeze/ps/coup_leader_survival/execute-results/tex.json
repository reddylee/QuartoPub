The central hypothesis posits that the mode of accession to power influences the duration of their tenures. Utilizing survival analysis, the results indicate that leaders who overstay their terms through autocoups generally remain in power longer than those who come to power through coups.\n\nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Survival, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nSurvival of political leaders has long been attracted political scholars'\nextensive attention. Although a lot of research has been done on this topic in\npolitical science, two specific types of leaders, coup-entry leaders and autocoup\nleaders, have not been paid enough attention. Examining the tenures of these two\nirregularly ascended leaders holds particular significance for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, irregularly ascended leaders constitute the majority of irregular exits\nfrom power. According to [@goemans2009], between 1945 and 2015, out of 1472\nleaders who assumed office through regular channels, approximately 213 exited\nirregularly (14.5%). Conversely, out of 308 leaders who assumed office through\nirregular means, roughly 158 (51.3%) experienced irregular exits.\n\nSecondly, among irregularly ascended leaders, the majority gained power through\nlaunching coups or overstaying in their office. As per [@goemans2009], out of 374\nleaders who exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, constituting 65.8%\nof these cases. Additionally, between 1945 and 2020, there were 106 attempts to\noverstay in power, of which 86 were successful [@zhu2024]. The overstay leaders,\nwho extend their legitimate term limits, technically staged coups against\nlegitimate future leaders. Therefore, they could be treated as autocoup leaders.\nHence, it becomes both relevant and enlightening to delve into and compare the\ntenures of survival between coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders.\n\nWhile it is expected that autocoup leaders survive longer than coup-entry leaders\nwhen considering their total tenures, a more insightful comparison arises when\nexamining the tenures following auto-coups in contrast to those of coup-entry\nleaders. Conducting a log-rank test in survival analysis on the leaders dataset\n[@goemans2009] and the author's autocoup dataset [@zhu2024] reveals a distinct\ncontrast between autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-pdf/fig-logrank-1.pdf){#fig-logrank fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSpecifically, according to @fig-logrank, the average survival time after\nauto-coups, excluding their original term duration, is approximately\n10.9 years. In contrast, leaders who ascend to power via coups\ntypically have an average survival time of 5.3 years, signifying an\naverage shortfall of 5 years in their tenure compared to autocoup leaders.\n\nThus, this study posits that the manner in which leaders ascend to power\nsignificantly influences the duration of their leadership tenure. Unlike leaders\nwho overstay, those who seize power through coups encounter greater challenges\nrelated to legitimacy, uncertainty, instability, and power-sharing, potentially\ncurtailing their survival duration.\n\nBy employing Cox proportional hazard model and extended Cox model, the results\nsuggest that leaders who exceed their term limits generally experience longer\ntenures compared to those who come to power through coups.\n\nThis study could offer dual contributions. First, it underscores that the\nduration of survival and unexpected exits is not solely determined by leaders'\nconduct after assuming power but is fundamentally shaped by their methods of\ngaining power. It highlights a notable disparity in tenures between overstaying\nleaders and coup-entry leaders. Second, it provides empirical measurements to\ncompare the tenure duration of these two irregularly ascended leaders, offering\ninsights into their distinct impacts on leadership longevity.\n\nSubsequent to the introduction, the second chapter of this research comprises a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, elucidating the potential\ncontributions of this paper. The third chapter delves into the examination of\nfactors influencing the survival of leaders who have ascended to power through\ncoups or self-coups. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data utilized,\nemploying a survival model for a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of\nleaders' survival. Chapter 5 presents the findings of this analysis, facilitating\nan in-depth discussion of the results. Finally, in Chapter 6, the paper concludes\nby synthesizing these findings and exploring their broader implications.\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n",
