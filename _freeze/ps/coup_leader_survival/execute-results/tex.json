The central hypothesis posits that the mode of accession to power influences the duration of their tenures. Utilizing survival analysis, the results indicate that leaders who overstay their terms through autocoups generally remain in power longer than those who come to power through coups.\n\nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Survival, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe survival of political leaders has been a well-studied topic in political\nscience. While the general framework has garnered significant attention, specific\ntypes of leaders, particularly coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders (discussed\nin more detail in Chapter 3), have received comparatively less scrutiny. However,\nexamining the tenures of these leader types is particularly significant.\n\nLeaders who ascend through irregular means, such as coups or autocoups, attract\nmore interest from both academics and journalists. The processes of entry,\ntenure, and exit are more predictable for leaders who come to power through\nregular channels, making their survival easier to anticipate and thus less\ncompelling to study. In contrast, the uncertainty surrounding the tenures of\nirregular leaders draws more attention. According to @goemans2009, leaders with\nirregular entries or exits are quite common and therefore worth analysing.\nBetween 1945 and 2015, approximately 14.5% (213 out of 1,472) of leaders who\nassumed office through regular channels exited irregularly. The proportion is\neven higher among leaders with irregular entries. During the same period,\napproximately 51.3% (158 out of 308) of those who assumed office through\nirregular means experienced irregular exits.\n\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders constitute the majority of those who ascend to or\nexit from power irregularly. Most leaders who gained power through irregular\nmeans did so by launching coups or overstaying in office. According to\n@goemans2009, out of 374 leaders who exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through\ncoups, accounting for 65.8% of these cases. @frantz2016 show that coup-related\nexits account for roughly one-third of all exits in autocracies, surpassing any\nother type, including regular transitions. Additionally, between 1945 and 2020,\nthere were 106 autocoup attempts, with 86 being successful [@zhu2024].\n\nDue to their irregularity and inherent uncertainty, it is challenging to\nprecisely measure the tenure of coup-entry and autocoup leaders. Nonetheless,\ncomparing the tenures of these two types of leaders is both possible and\ninsightful. Conducting a log-rank test in survival analysis on the leaders\ndataset [@goemans2009] and the autocoup dataset [@zhu2024] reveals a distinct\ncontrast in the tenures of autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-pdf/fig-logrank-1.pdf){#fig-logrank fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nPreliminary findings from survival analysis (see @fig-logrank) indicate a\nsignificant difference in leadership tenures. Leaders who consolidate power\nthrough autocoups have a longer average tenure post-autocoup (approximately\n10.9 years) compared to coup-entry leaders (approximately\n5.3 years). This suggests a potential shortfall of about 5 years in\nthe average tenure of coup-entry leaders.\n\nWe argue that the method of accession significantly influences leadership\nlongevity. Coup leaders likely face greater challenges to their legitimacy,\nresulting in a more precarious initial period in power. They encounter higher\nlevels of uncertainty, instability, and pressure to share power, all of which\ncontribute to a shorter average tenure compared to autocoup leaders.\n\nEmploying the Cox proportional hazards model and the extended Cox model, our\nresults indicate that autocoup leaders generally experience longer post-autocoup\ntenures compared to coup-entry leaders.\n\nThis study makes two significant contributions. Firstly, it sheds light on a\ncritical factor often overlooked in leadership survival studies: the impact of\nthe method of accession to power. Leaders' survival is not solely determined by\ntheir actions after taking power but also by how they acquired power in the first\nplace. Secondly, utilizing survival models, this research provides empirical\nevidence of the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and\ncoup-entry leaders. This finding may help explain the increasing prevalence of\noverstaying in power through autocoups since 2000, as more incumbents may be\nencouraged by precedents, and ruling elites tend to follow and support such\nactions, benefiting from a relatively longer tenure.\n\nThe remainder of the paper delves deeper into this topic. Chapter 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Chapter 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a\ndetailed discussion of the results. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by synthesizing\nthe key takeaways and exploring their broader implications.\n\n## Literature review\n\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science\nresearch for decades. This enduring interest arises from the wide-ranging\nvariations observed across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Previous\nstudies have identified two crucial yet interconnected aspects of political\nsurvival: regime survival and individual leader survival.\n\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as\nmonarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader\nsurvival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual\nleaders' time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns.\nFor example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific\npolitical parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders\n(Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see\nlong-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a slower\npace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some military\nregimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party or junta and\nthe leader of the country. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of\nindividual leader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how long leaders\nremain in power.\n\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a\nwealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific\nmechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as\ndemocracies or autocracies [@svolik2014; @davenport2021]. Others seek to develop\nmore generalizable theoretical frameworks that can explain leader survival across\ndiverse political systems [@buenodemesquita2003]. While the development of a\nuniversal theory remains an alluring goal, it is important to acknowledge the\ninherent challenges in creating a single model that encompasses the complexities\nof leadership survival across all regime types.\n\nThe mechanisms governing power transitions vary significantly across different\nregimes, particularly between democracies and autocracies. In many autocratic\nsystems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential candidates are often\nrestricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families, military elites, or members\nof the ruling party. While political competition and elections may exist in some\nautocracies, there are often significant barriers to entry for legitimate\nchallengers. Potential rivals may face threats such as assassination,\nimprisonment, or exile. Moreover, selection processes are shrouded in secrecy,\nwith outsiders unable to participate or obtain information on the selections, let\nalone express dissent or complain about the results. This lack of inclusivity and\ntransparency makes it challenging to gauge true levels of public support compared\nto democracies. Consequently, calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as\nexplored by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes a near-impossible task in autocracies.\n\nTherefore, focusing research on more specific regimes or types of leaders may be\nmore appropriate. While regular and anticipated leadership changes are important\nas well, they offer less fertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader\nlongevity, as the vast majority of leaders who assume power through established\nchannels also exit power through established mechanisms [@goemans2009]. In\ncontrast, the study of political survival among irregular leaders is particularly\ncaptivating due to the intricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular\nleadership transitions.\n\nThe diverse mechanisms influencing political leadership survival, as discussed\nabove, have prompted scholars to delve deeper into more specific determinants.\nTwo primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.\n\nThe first perspective considers objective factors and resources available to\nleaders. These include elements such as personal competence [@yu2016], societal\nstability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999; @williams2011],\naccess to natural resources [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012; @wright2013], or\nexternal support networks [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017].\n\nThe second perspective explores subjective factors, focusing on the strategies\nleaders employ to consolidate their power. This encompasses both the formulation\nand implementation of political policies and the leaders' responses to\nopposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions [@gandhi2007; @morrison2009;\n@escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].\n\nUnsurprisingly, coups have garnered significant scholarly attention due to their\npivotal role in removing leaders [@svolik2009; @frantz2016]. Existing research\ndelves into strategies for thwarting coups [@powell2017; @sudduth2017;\n@debruin2020], as well as how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup\nattempts [@easton2018]. For instance, @sudduth2017 examines the post-coup actions\nof dictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders\ninitially wield more power than elites within the regime, rendering them less\nsusceptible to subsequent coups, challenging the conventional view of new leaders\nas inherently weak [@roessler2011]. Meanwhile, @sudduth2018 investigates how\nleaders' entry methods affect their removal in dictatorships, positing that\nirregular entry does not necessarily increase the likelihood of removal; in fact,\nsome forms of irregular entry may offer protection.\n\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts,\nincluding universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed\nchallenges, a significant gap persists. There is a lack of research specifically\nexploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their reigns\nthrough autocoups compared to coup-entry leaders. This study aims to address this\ngap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership survival between\nthese two distinct leader types.\n\n## Survival dynamics of autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders\n\n### Autocoup leader and coup-entry leader\n\nAs emphasized in Chapter 2, delving into leadership survival poses inherent\nchallenges, given factors such as the opacity and diverse mechanisms of power\ntransitions. However, these challenges underscore the significance of this\nresearch, as it sheds light on understudied dynamics.\n\nWhile the survival of political leaders manifests complexity and variation, it is\nnot devoid of patterns entirely. Leaders of similar types often exhibit\nsignificant comparability. Before delving into the comparison, it is necessary to\nclarify several relative terminologies.\n\nWe define an autocoup as a situation where an incumbent leader utilizes\nillegitimate or unconstitutional methods to extend their tenure and remain in\npower. An autocoup is deemed successful if this power extension lasts for at\nleast six months. Coups, on the other hand, are defined as illegal and overt\nattempts by the military or other powerful groups within the state to unseat the\nsitting leader [@powell2011]. Similar to coups, successful autocoups in this\nstudy will be measured by a power usurpation lasting at least six months,\ndiffering from the seven-day duration coded by Powell and Thyne.\n\nIt is also crucial to clarify the distinction between an autocoup leader and a\ncoup-entry leader, as the survival of leadership is the main concern of this\nstudy.\n\n-   **Autocoup Leader:** This refers to an incumbent leader who successfully uses\n    illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. In an\n    autocoup, the leader orchestrates the power grab and continues to rule\n    afterwards.\n\n-   **Coup-Entry Leader:** This term designates the leader who assumes power\n    after a successful coup d'état. Unlike in autocoups, coups often involve\n    multiple coup leaders (individuals or groups) who overthrow the incumbent\n    leader. The coup-entry leader is the individual who ultimately takes the\n    reins of power after the coup succeeds. While coup leaders may play a role in\n    selecting the coup-entry leader, this is not always the case. In some\n    instances, they may support someone outside the coup plot to become the new\n    leader. Regardless of the selection process, the coup-entry leader is the one\n    who assumes formal leadership following a successful coup.\n\nGiven that autocoup leaders typically exhibit longer overall tenures compared to\ncoup-entry leaders, this study focuses on a more nuanced comparison.\nSpecifically, we will analyse the **post-autocoup** tenure of autocoup leaders\nand contrast it with the **post-coup** tenure of coup-entry leaders. The\nexamination of the survival tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders is\nmotivated by their relevance and similarity in terms of illegitimacy,\nuncertainty, and instability.\n\n-   **Illegitimacy:** Both leader types lack legitimacy, though it manifests\n    differently. Coup leaders seize power through force or the threat of force,\n    making their illegitimacy explicit. Autocoups often employ seemingly legal\n    procedures like court rulings or votes, but these processes are frequently\n    manipulated by incumbents leveraging their control [@zhu2024]. This\n    perception of illegitimacy can be used to justify the removal of such\n    leaders, even if the means of removal are themselves illegitimate.\n\n-   **Uncertainty:** The irregular means by which coup-entry and autocoup leaders\n    take or retain power create significant uncertainty regarding their long-term\n    rule and eventual exit. The established power transition process is\n    undermined, raising questions about whether these leaders will enact\n    constitutional succession protocols, and if so, whether those protocols will\n    be followed. This ambiguity affects not only elites and citizens but also the\n    leaders themselves, who face ongoing uncertainties about when, how, and to\n    whom power might be transferred. Historical data on irregular leaders\n    supports this point. Leader dataset shows that over half of irregular leaders\n    experience irregular exits, and coup-related exits constitute more than\n    two-thirds of all irregular exits [@goemans2009]. Furthermore, @frantz2016\n    show that coup-related exits account for roughly one-third of all exits in\n    autocracies, surpassing any other type, including regular transitions.\n\n-   **Instability:** Coup-entry and autocoup leaders are aware of their own\n    legitimacy and uncertainty challenges, which can fuel insecurity and a sense\n    of crisis. In attempts to consolidate power, they may resort to reshuffling\n    power structures or purging potential challengers. However, these efforts to\n    maintain stability and strengthen their position often backfire, triggering\n    greater instability.\n\nThe interplay of illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability creates a complex\nenvironment that significantly influences leader tenure.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nAs previous studies have shown, while many factors can affect the survival of\nleaders, the fundamental determinant of tenure longevity is the leader's ability\nto maintain power. As long as they can hold onto power or balance it in their\nfavour, they can remain in office. However, as discussed earlier, although both\ncoup-entry and autocoup leaders face similar challenges related to illegitimacy,\nuncertainty, and instability, the severity of these challenges differs. This\ndifference places the two types of leaders at varying levels of disadvantage in\nterms of power balance.\n\n#### Illegitimacy\n\nWhile both coup-entry and autocoup leaders lack genuine legitimacy, the nature of\nthis illegitimacy differs significantly. Coups represent a more blatant disregard\nfor legal processes, often involving force or the threat of force to seize power.\nIn contrast, autocoups employ a façade of legality through tactics such as\nmanipulating constitutional interpretations, engineering parliamentary votes,\ninfluencing court decisions, and even holding referendums. Despite this veneer,\nthese manoeuvres do not erase the underlying lack of genuine legitimacy, hence\nthis study categorizes them as autocoups. However, there is considerable debate\namong scholars, with some arguing for less severe terms like \"incumbent overstay\"\nor \"executive takeover\" due to the perceived legality.\n\nThis perceived legitimacy can provide a temporary advantage for autocoup leaders.\nChallengers are often constrained to operate within legal frameworks, making it\ndifficult to directly confront the incumbent.\n\n#### Uncertainty\n\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders face different levels of uncertainty immediately\nfollowing their rise to or overstay power.\n\nAfter a coup, at least three major uncertainties arise regarding leadership and\nits tenure. First, it is unclear who will assume leadership. Although coup\nleaders often take power, some may return or promise to return power to civilian\nleaders. Even among coup leaders, determining who will lead can be problematic,\nas coup plotters are sometimes a group without a clear core leader. For instance,\nfollowing the 1973 Chilean coup, the initial plan for a rotating presidency among\nmilitary leaders was abandoned when General Pinochet consolidated control and\nremained in power until 1990 [@svolik2014]. Second, the duration of the coup\nleader's rule is uncertain. Leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt (1954 coup),\nMuammar Gaddafi in Libya (1969 coup), and Idi Amin in Uganda (1971 coup) aimed to\nretain power for life [@geddes2018], but their ability to do so was uncertain.\nOthers promise to transfer power to civilian authorities, but the timing and\nfulfillment of these promises are unclear. For example, Myanmar's military junta\n(2021 coup) has repeatedly extended a state of emergency, clinging to power\nbeyond the promised time-frame[^1]. Conversely, after the 2010 coup in Niger, the\nmilitary honoured their promise by restoring civilian rule within the same year\n[@ginsburg2019]. Third, the successors of coup leaders are uncertain. Some may\ndesignate successors from their inner circle, including family members, while\nothers may support general elections, though whether this will be fulfilled as\nintended remains uncertain.\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders present a clearer picture regarding leadership and\ntenure. There is no ambiguity about who will rule after an autocoup. In the\nmedium term, autocoup leaders typically hold office themselves. Many, like Putin\nin Russia and Xi Jinping in China, seek to extend their rule indefinitely and are\nunlikely to relinquish power voluntarily. Others attempt to extend their terms\nincrementally, such as President Menem of Argentina, who overstayed until 1993\nbut failed in his bid for another term in 1999 [@llanos2019].\n\n#### Instability\n\nThe stability of a regime, particularly in an autocracy, hinges on maintaining a\nbalance of power. Coups, however, inevitably disrupt this balance, even when they\nare bloodless, necessitating the creation of a new equilibrium. The ousting of\nprevious rulers requires dismantling the established governing structure and\nreshuffling high-ranking officials, actions that inherently generate instability\nand create adversaries for the new leadership. This makes restoring order and\nestablishing a balanced power structure notably challenging. Studies show that\nnew leaders often purge rival elite groups to consolidate their power at the\noutset of their tenure [@sudduth2017; @roessler2011]. Such actions can provoke\nbacklash even from close allies. For instance, in Uganda, President Obote's\nattempt to undermine the army commander-in-chief, Idi Amin, led to Amin gaining\nthe army's support and ultimately ousting Obote in a 1971 coup. Similarly, in\nPakistan in 1999, shortly after Prime Minister Sharif dismissed powerful army\nchief General Pervez Musharraf, Sharif himself was ousted in a coup orchestrated\nby Musharraf and his supporters [@sudduth2017].\n\nTo consolidate power, coup-entry leaders often have to compromise with internal\nor external power challengers. However, these compromises are frequently unstable\nand easily broken. The situation becomes even more complex when there is a risk\nof civil war. Leaders may attempt to reduce the likelihood of subsequent coups,\npotentially increasing the chances of societal rebellions and civil wars\n[@roessler2011].\n\nMoreover, instability extends beyond leadership to policies. A new leadership\ngroup often brings new policies, and coups are sometimes triggered by\ndisagreements over significant policies. Major policy shifts can instigate\ndissent or grievances from various ruling factions, communities, regions,\nethnicities, or religions.\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders encounter far fewer of these issues, as their\nregimes experience fewer abrupt changes. They face less pressure to dismantle the\nexisting ruling paradigm and establish a new order. Even when adjustments are\nnecessary, they have more time to implement changes gradually.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-leaders .cell tbl-cap='Main features of autocoup and coup-entry leaders'}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{75pt}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{187.5pt}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{187.5pt}}\n\\toprule\nFeature & Autocoup Leader & Coup Entry Leader \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nIllegitimacy & Normally attained through\nlawful procedures, but\nlacking consensus\nlegitimacy & Blatantly illegal \\\\ \n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Uncertainty}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Initially with some certainty, but decreases as the leader's age grows or health worsens}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Significant uncertainty initially}}} \\\\ \nInstability & Relatively stable & Unstable except when a strongman emerges or constitutional institutions are established \\\\ \n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Balance of Power}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Generally in a better position of power}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Initially unclear and challenging to establish a balance}}} \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n:::\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, coup-entry leaders typically face a greater degree of the\nchallenges discussed earlier, placing them at a significant disadvantage in the\nbalance of power compared to autocoup leaders. This disadvantage creates a\nself-perpetuating cycle. Weaker leaders struggle to attract and retain strong\nsupport, making them more vulnerable to challenges. The perception of risk\ndiscourages potential allies, further eroding their power base. As shown in\n@tbl-coups, the top 10 countries with the most coup attempts between 1950 and\n2023 are predominantly autocracies. This suggests that the more coups occur in a\ncountry, the more likely additional coups are to happen in the future.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts (1950–2023)'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.05\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.05\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lccr}\n\\toprule\nCountry & Coup Attempted & Coup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nBolivia & 23 & 11 & 47.8\\% \\\\ \nArgentina & 20 & 7 & 35.0\\% \\\\ \nSudan & 17 & 6 & 35.3\\% \\\\ \nHaiti & 13 & 9 & 69.2\\% \\\\ \nVenezuela & 13 & 0 & 0.0\\% \\\\ \nIraq & 12 & 4 & 33.3\\% \\\\ \nSyria & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nThailand & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nEcuador & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nBurundi & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nGuatemala & 10 & 5 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 491 & 245 & 49.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GIC dataset}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nConversely, autocoup leaders, often benefiting from a veneer of legitimacy and a\nstronger initial position, are better able to consolidate power and attract\nsupporters. This advantage can be self-reinforcing, as a strong power base\ndiscourages challenges and fosters loyalty. This dynamic is evident in cases like\nChina (2018), where the National People's Congress granted Xi Jinping the\npotential to rule for life[^2], and Russia (2020), where constitutional changes\nallow Putin to potentially remain in power until 2036[^3].\n\nThese features and the balance of power contribute to a shorter expected tenure\nfor coup-entry leaders compared to the relatively longer tenures of autocoup\nleaders. The average survival period following an autocoup is approximately five\nyears longer than that of coup-entry leaders (@fig-logrank). Based on these\nobservations and discussions, I propose the following hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups\n> are more likely to experience longer leadership survival compared to coup-entry\n> leaders.***\n\nIn the subsequent section, I will outline the research methodology used in this\npaper. I will introduce several control variables to determine if the hypothesis\nremains persistent and robust.\n\n## Research Design\n\n### Methodology: Survival analysis\n\nIn order to test the hypothesis, I will employ two cox models to analyze the\nsurvival tenures of leaders who overstay their terms and those who come to power\nthrough coups. The first model will utilize the Cox proportional hazards model\n(referred to as the Cox PH model), where I only use the variables at the entry\nyear and do not consider the changes of these variables among leaders' survival\ntimes.\n\nHowever, except the main concern variable in this research, the leader type, the\ncontrol variables, such as economic performance, Polity5, political stability, do\nchange over time. The second model will take this into consideration and use the\ntime-dependent Cox model (referred to as the Time-dependent Cox model).\n\nUnlike the Kaplan-Meier model, the Cox model enables the estimation of the\nimpacts of multiple factors. Although it does not directly estimate the duration\nof tenure in office, it evaluates the hazard rate associated with being ousted\nfrom power, which essentially represents different facets of the same phenomenon.\nAs a leader's cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their probability of\nsurvival in office decreases.\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\nSurv(survival\\_time, status) &= group + \\\\\n&GDP\\_growth\\_trend + GDP\\_pc\\_log + \\\\\n&pop\\_log + polity5 + polstab + age\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n```\n\n\n### Data\n\nThe main variables are as follows.\n\n#### Dependent variables\n\n-   **Survival time:** the duration of leaders' tenure in days. For coup-entry\n    leaders, this time span initiates on the day they assume power, while\n    overstaying leaders' tenure begins on the expiration date of their initial\n    term. For instance, considering Xi Jinping's case, he assumed power in 2013,\n    successfully removing term limits in 2018. However, his initial two-term\n    tenure was due to end in 2023. Hence, his survival time commences from 2023\n    rather than 2013, signifying the start of his original tenure. The survival\n    time concludes on the day the leader exits office, applying to both\n    coup-entry and overstaying leaders.\n\n-   **End point status:** 0 = censored, 1 = ousted. I categorized ousting by\n    force as 1, even in cases where some leaders \"voluntarily\" resigned under\n    pressure. Other methods of leaving office are considered censored, which can\n    encompass situations where leaders appoint their successors, opt for\n    democratic means of overturn, face health-related issues, or encounter\n    natural death.\n\n#### Independent variable\n\n-   **Leader type:** Group A = overstaying leader, Group B = coup-entry leader.\n    This variable is the primary independent variable of interest, as it serves\n    as the basis for comparison of survival time between the two types of\n    leaders.\n\nThe dependent and independent data are sourced from the author's incumbent\noverstay dataset and the leaders dataset by [@goemans2009].\n\n#### Control variables\n\n-   **Indicators of Economic Influence:** To evaluate economic influence, I rely\n    on two primary indicators: the trend in GDP growth (`GDP_growth_trend`) and\n    the logarithm of GDP per capita (`GDP_pc_log)`. The GDP_growth_trend is\n    determined by contrasting the GDP growth in the year of a coup entry or\n    overstaying with the preceding 3-year moving average of the growth rate. The\n    dataset employed for these metrics is sourced from V-Dem Data.\n\n-   **Degree of Democracy:** The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5\n    scores (`polity`) at the entry year for each respective country. This dataset\n    is sourced from the Center for Systemic Peace (CSP)[^4].\n\n-   **Population Size:** Accounting for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,\n    the log population size (`pop_log`) is considered. This data is obtained from\n    the V-Dem Data and is evaluated in relation to its influence on leadership\n    survival.\n\n-   **Political Stability:** The stability of the political landscape is crucial\n    in evaluating the survival tenures of leaders. To quantify this aspect, the\n    Major Episodes of Political Violence Variables dataset from the CSP is\n    utilized to measure political stability (`polstab`) at the leader's entry\n    year.\n\n-   **Leader's Age:** The age of the leader at the entry year serves as an\n    additional variable in the analysis, providing insight into potential\n    correlations with leadership survival. This data is sourced from the leaders\n    dataset by [@goemans2009].\n\n### \n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n[^1]: https://thediplomat.com/2023/08/myanmar-junta-extends-state-of-emergency-for-fourth-time/:\n    Myanmar\\\n    Junta Extends State of Emergency for Fourth Time.
