We hypothesize that the method of accession significantly affects leader tenure. Utilizing the Cox proportional hazards model and a time-dependent Cox model, we provide compelling evidence of differing survival times between these two leader types. The findings indicate that coup-entry leaders face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to autocoup leaders. Specifically, coup-entry leaders are found to have a much shorter average tenure and a higher probability of being ousted. This study underscores the implications of these findings for political stability and democratic processes, suggesting that the relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could incentivize more incumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to democratic backsliding. Furthermore, this research contributes to the academic literature by effectively utilizing a newly developed dataset on autocoups, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Survival, Political Leadership, Cox Model]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhy do some leaders rule for decades while others stay in power for only years,\nmonths, or even days? This question has garnered substantial attention, making\nthe survival of political leaders a well-explored topic in political science.\nAlthough the general framework of political survival has been extensively studied\nand numerous theories have been proposed, specific types of leaders—particularly\ncoup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders (defined in more detail in Chapter\n3)—have received comparatively less scrutiny. Nonetheless, examining the tenures\nof these specific leader types is particularly significant, as it provides\ninsights into the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and their impact\non political stability and democratic processes.\n\nThe processes of entry, tenure, and exit are more predictable for leaders who\ncome to power through regular channels, making their survival easier to\nanticipate and thus less compelling to study. In contrast, leaders who ascend\nthrough irregular means, such as coups or autocoups, attract more interest from\nboth academics and journalists due to the unpredictable and often tumultuous\nnature of their tenures. According to @goemans2009, leaders with irregular\nentries or exits are quite common. Between 1945 and 2015, more than half of the\nleaders who entered power irregularly (158 out of 308) eventually exited\nirregularly as well. This rate is significantly higher than that of leaders who\nassumed office through regular channels, of whom only 14.5% (213 out of 1,472)\nexperienced irregular exits. While this percentage is still notable, it is\nconsiderably lower than that for irregular-entry leaders.\n\nAmong leaders with irregular entry or exit, coup-entry and autocoup leaders\nconstitute the majority. According to @goemans2009, out of 374 leaders who exited\nirregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, accounting for 65.8% of these cases.\n@frantz2016 show that coup-related exits account for roughly one-third of all\nexits in autocracies, surpassing any other type, including regular transitions.\nAdditionally, between 1945 and 2020, there were 106 autocoup attempts, with 86\nbeing successful [@zhu2024].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to their irregularity and inherent uncertainty, precisely measuring the\nsurvival tenure of coup-entry and autocoup leaders presents a significant\nchallenge. Nonetheless, a comparative analysis of the tenures of these two types\nof leaders is both feasible and valuable. Leaders who consolidate power through\nautocoups have a longer average tenure post-autocoup (approximately\n10.8 years) compared to coup-entry leaders (approximately\n5.4 years). This suggests a potential shortfall of about 5 years in\nthe average tenure of coup-entry leaders.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-pdf/fig-logrank-1.pdf){#fig-logrank fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nA preliminary analysis using a log-rank test in survival analysis, as shown in\n@fig-logrank, reveals a distinct contrast in the tenures of autocoup leaders\nversus coup-entry leaders. The survival curve for autocoup leaders is\nconsistently higher than that for coup-entry leaders, and the difference is\nstatistically significant. This indicates that autocoup leaders generally have a\nlonger survival tenure and a lower risk of being ousted compared to coup-entry\nleaders.\n\nWe argue that the method of accession significantly influences leadership\nlongevity. Coup-entry leaders are likely to face greater challenges to their\nrule, resulting in a shorter average tenure compared to autocoup leaders.\n\nUsing the Cox proportional hazards model and the time-dependent Cox model, our\nresults indicate that autocoup leaders generally experience longer tenures\ncompared to coup-entry leaders.\n\nThis study makes two potential contributions. Firstly, it sheds light on an\nunderstudied factor in leadership survival analysis: the impact of the method of\naccession to power. Leaders' survival is influenced not only by their ruling\nstrategies after taking power but also by how they acquired power initially.\nSecondly, by utilizing survival models, this research provides empirical evidence\nof the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and coup-entry\nleaders. This finding may help explain the increasing prevalence of overstaying\nin power through autocoups since 2000. As more incumbents observe these\nprecedents, they may be encouraged to adopt similar tactics, with ruling elites\ntending to follow and support such actions to benefit from a relatively longer\ntenure.\n\nThe remainder of the paper delves deeper into this topic. Chapter 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Chapter 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a\ndetailed discussion of the results. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by synthesizing\nthe key takeaways and exploring their broader implications.\n\n## Literature review\n\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science\nresearch for decades. This enduring interest arises from the wide-ranging\nvariations observed across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Previous\nstudies have identified two crucial yet interconnected aspects of political\nsurvival: regime survival and individual leader survival.\n\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as\nmonarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader\nsurvival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual\nleaders' time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns.\nFor example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific\npolitical parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders\n(Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see\nlong-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a more\nfrequent pace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some\nmilitary regimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party or\njunta and the leader of the country. This study specifically investigates the\ndynamics of individual leader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how\nlong leaders remain in power.\n\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a\nwealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific\nmechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as\ndemocracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies [@davenport2021]. Others seek to develop\nmore generalizable theoretical frameworks that can explain leader survival across\ndiverse political systems [@buenodemesquita2003]. While the development of a\nuniversal theory remains an alluring goal, it is important to acknowledge the\ninherent challenges in creating a single model that encompasses the complexities\nof leadership survival across all regime types.\n\nThe mechanisms governing power transitions vary significantly across different\nregimes, particularly between democracies and autocracies. In many autocratic\nsystems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential candidates are often\nrestricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families, military elites, or members\nof the ruling party. While political competition and elections may exist in some\nautocracies, there are often significant barriers to entry for legitimate\nchallengers. Potential rivals may face threats such as assassination,\nimprisonment, or exile. Moreover, selection processes are shrouded in secrecy,\nwith outsiders unable to participate or obtain information on the selections, let\nalone express dissent or complain about the results. This lack of inclusivity and\ntransparency makes it challenging to gauge true levels of public support compared\nto democracies. Consequently, calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as\nexplored by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes a near-impossible task in autocracies.\n\nTherefore, focusing research on more specific regimes or types of leaders may be\nmore appropriate. While regular and anticipated leadership changes are important\nas well, they offer less fertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader\nlongevity, as the vast majority of leaders who assume power through established\nchannels also exit power through established mechanisms [@goemans2009]. In\ncontrast, the study of political survival among irregular leaders is particularly\ncaptivating due to the intricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular\nleadership transitions.\n\nThe diverse mechanisms influencing political leadership survival, as discussed\nabove, have prompted scholars to delve deeper into more specific determinants.\nTwo primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.\n\nThe first perspective considers objective factors and resources available to\nleaders. These include elements such as personal competence [@yu2016], societal\nstability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999; @williams2011],\naccess to natural resources [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012; @wright2013], or\nexternal support networks [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017].\n\nThe second perspective explores subjective factors, focusing on the strategies\nleaders employ to consolidate their power. This encompasses both the formulation\nand implementation of political policies and the leaders' responses to\nopposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions [@gandhi2007; @morrison2009;\n@escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].\n\nUnsurprisingly, coups have garnered significant scholarly attention due to their\npivotal role in removing leaders [@svolik2009; @frantz2016]. Existing research\ndelves into strategies for thwarting coups [@powell2017; @sudduth2017;\n@debruin2020], as well as how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup\nattempts [@easton2018]. For instance, @sudduth2017 examines the post-coup actions\nof dictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders\ninitially wield more power than elites within the regime, rendering them less\nsusceptible to subsequent coups, challenging the conventional view of new leaders\nas inherently weak [@roessler2011]. Meanwhile, @sudduth2018 investigates how\nleaders' entry methods affect their removal in dictatorships, positing that\nirregular entry does not necessarily increase the likelihood of removal; in fact,\nsome forms of irregular entry may offer protection.\n\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts,\nincluding universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed\nchallenges, a significant gap persists. There is a lack of research specifically\nexploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their reigns\nthrough autocoups compared to coup-entry leaders. This study aims to address this\ngap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership survival between\nthese two distinct leader types.\n\n## Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-entry leaders\n\n### Autocoup leaders versus coup-entry leaders\n\nAs emphasized in Chapter 2, delving into leadership survival poses inherent\nchallenges, given factors such as the opacity and diverse mechanisms of power\ntransitions. However, these challenges underscore the significance of this\nresearch, as it sheds light on understudied dynamics.\n\nWhile the survival of political leaders manifests complexity and variation, it is\nnot devoid of patterns entirely. Leaders of similar types often exhibit\nsignificant comparability. Before delving into the comparison, it is necessary to\nclarify several relative terminologies.\n\nFirstly, we define an autocoup as a situation where an incumbent leader utilizes\nillegitimate or unconstitutional methods to extend their tenure and remain in\npower. An autocoup is deemed successful if this power extension lasts for at\nleast six months. Coups, on the other hand, are defined as illegal and overt\nattempts by the military or other powerful groups within the state to unseat the\nsitting leader [@powell2011]. Similar to coups, successful autocoups in this\nstudy will be measured by a power usurpation lasting at least six months,\ndiffering from the seven-day duration coded by Powell and Thyne.\n\nSecondly, it is also crucial to clarify the distinction between an autocoup\nleader and a coup-entry leader, as the survival of leadership is the main concern\nof this study.\n\n-   **Autocoup leader:** This refers to an incumbent leader who successfully uses\n    illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. In an\n    autocoup, the leader orchestrates the power grab and continues to rule\n    afterwards.\n\n-   **Coup-entry leader:** This term designates the individual who assumes power\n    after a successful coup. The coup leader and the coup-entry leader may or may\n    not be the same person. Unlike in autocoups, coups often involve multiple\n    leaders (individuals or groups) who overthrow the incumbent leader, but\n    typically only one of them assumes supreme power. In some instances, coup\n    leaders may support someone outside the coup plot to become the new leader.\n    For example, military officers might return power to civilians after a coup\n    or support a new general election. Regardless of the specific scenario, a\n    coup-entry leader in this study refers to the individual who assumes formal\n    leadership following a successful coup.\n\nGiven that autocoup leaders typically exhibit longer overall tenures compared to\ncoup-entry leaders, this study focuses on a more nuanced comparison.\nSpecifically, we will analyse the **post-autocoup** tenure of autocoup leaders\nand contrast it with the **post-coup** tenure of coup-entry leaders. The\nexamination of the survival tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders is\nmotivated by their relevance and similarity in terms of illegitimacy,\nuncertainty, and instability.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nPrevious research emphasizes that skilful power retention is the ultimate\ndeterminant of leader longevity. Leaders who can maintain control or manipulate\nthe balance of power tend to stay in office longer. However, as discussed\nearlier, although both coup-entry and autocoup leaders face similar challenges,\nthe intensity of their challenges related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and\ninstability differs. These discrepancies create an uneven playing field in terms\nof power dynamics, with coup-entry leaders at a significant disadvantage. This\ndisparity in power equilibrium shapes a nuanced landscape that profoundly impacts\nthe duration of leader tenures.\n\n#### Illegitimacy\n\nBoth leader types lack legitimacy, though it manifests differently. Coup leaders\nseize power through force or the threat of force, making their illegitimacy\nexplicit. Autocoups often employ seemingly legal procedures, but these processes\nare frequently manipulated by incumbents leveraging their control [@zhu2024].\nThis perception of illegitimacy can be used to justify the removal of autocoup\nand coup-entry leaders, even if the means of removal are themselves illegitimate.\n\nWhile both coup-entry and autocoup leaders lack genuine legitimacy, the nature of\nthis illegitimacy differs significantly. Coups represent a more blatant disregard\nfor legal processes, often involving force or the threat of force to seize power.\nIn contrast, autocoups employ a façade of legality through tactics such as\nmanipulating constitutional interpretations, engineering parliamentary votes,\ninfluencing court decisions, and even holding referendums. Despite this veneer,\nthese manoeuvres do not erase the underlying lack of genuine legitimacy, hence\nthis study categorizes them as autocoups. However, there is considerable debate\namong scholars, with some arguing for less severe terms like \"incumbent overstay\"\nor \"executive takeover\" due to the perceived legality.\n\nThis perceived legitimacy can provide a temporary advantage for autocoup leaders.\nChallengers are often constrained to operate within legal frameworks, making it\ndifficult to directly confront the incumbent.\n\n#### Uncertainty\n\nThe tumultuous paths to power undertaken by coup-initiators and autocratic\nleaders cast a shadow of uncertainty over their reigns and eventual departure.\nTheir ascension through irregular means undermines established power transition\nnorms, leaving doubts lingering over their commitment to constitutional\nsuccession protocols. This uncertainty not only unsettles elites and citizens but\nalso plagues the leaders themselves, who grapple with the perpetual ambiguity\nsurrounding the transfer of power – when, how, and to whom. Historical analyses\nunderscore this predicament, with data revealing that more than two-thirds of\nirregular exits from leadership stem from coup-related upheavals [@goemans2009].\n\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders face different levels of uncertainty immediately\nfollowing their rise to or overstay power.\n\nAfter a coup, at least three major uncertainties arise regarding leadership and\nits tenure. First, it is unclear who will assume leadership. Although coup\nleaders often take power, some may return or promise to return power to civilian\nleaders. Even among coup leaders, determining who will lead can be problematic,\nas coup plotters are sometimes a group without a clear core leader. For instance,\nfollowing the 1973 Chilean coup, the initial plan for a rotating presidency among\nmilitary leaders was abandoned when General Pinochet consolidated control and\nremained in power until 1990 [@svolik2014]. Second, the duration of the coup\nleader's rule is uncertain. Leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt (1954 coup),\nMuammar Gaddafi in Libya (1969 coup), and Idi Amin in Uganda (1971 coup) aimed to\nretain power for life [@geddes2018], but their ability to do so was uncertain.\nOthers promise to transfer power to civilian authorities, but the timing and\nfulfillment of these promises are unclear. For example, Myanmar's military junta\n(2021 coup) has repeatedly extended a state of emergency, clinging to power\nbeyond the promised time-frame[^1]. Conversely, after the 2010 coup in Niger, the\nmilitary honoured their promise by restoring civilian rule within the same year\n[@ginsburg2019]. Third, the successors of coup leaders are uncertain. Some may\ndesignate successors from their inner circle, including family members, while\nothers may support general elections, though whether this will be fulfilled as\nintended remains uncertain.\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders present a clearer picture regarding leadership and\ntenure. There is no ambiguity about who will rule after an autocoup. In the\nmedium term, autocoup leaders typically hold office themselves. Many, like Putin\nin Russia and Xi Jinping in China, seek to extend their rule indefinitely and are\nunlikely to relinquish power voluntarily. Others attempt to extend their terms\nincrementally, such as President Menem of Argentina, who overstayed until 1993\nbut failed in his bid for another term in 1999 [@llanos2019].\n\n#### Instability\n\nMoreover, the awareness of their shaky legitimacy and the persistent uncertainty\nbreeds insecurity and a perpetual sense of crisis among coup-entry leaders and\nautocoup leaders. In a bid to solidify their grip on power, they often resort to\nreshaping power dynamics or purging potential adversaries. Paradoxically, these\nattempts to bolster stability and fortify their rule frequently boomerang,\nunleashing even greater turmoil and instability.\n\nThe stability of a regime, particularly in an autocracy, hinges on maintaining a\nbalance of power. Coups, however, inevitably disrupt this balance, even when they\nare bloodless, necessitating the creation of a new equilibrium. The ousting of\nprevious rulers requires dismantling the established governing structure and\nreshuffling high-ranking officials, actions that inherently generate instability\nand create adversaries for the new leadership. This makes restoring order and\nestablishing a balanced power structure notably challenging. Studies show that\nnew leaders often purge rival elite groups to consolidate their power at the\noutset of their tenure [@sudduth2017; @roessler2011]. Such actions can provoke\nbacklash even from close allies. For instance, in Uganda, President Obote's\nattempt to undermine the army commander-in-chief, Idi Amin, led to Amin gaining\nthe army's support and ultimately ousting Obote in a 1971 coup. Similarly, in\nPakistan in 1999, shortly after Prime Minister Sharif dismissed powerful army\nchief General Pervez Musharraf, Sharif himself was ousted in a coup orchestrated\nby Musharraf and his supporters [@sudduth2017].\n\nTo consolidate power, coup-entry leaders often have to compromise with internal\nor external power challengers. However, these compromises are frequently unstable\nand easily broken. The situation becomes even more complex when there is a risk\nof civil war. Leaders may attempt to reduce the likelihood of subsequent coups,\npotentially increasing the chances of societal rebellions and civil wars\n[@roessler2011].\n\nMoreover, instability extends beyond leadership to policies. A new leadership\ngroup often brings new policies, and coups are sometimes triggered by\ndisagreements over significant policies. Major policy shifts can instigate\ndissent or grievances from various ruling factions, communities, regions,\nethnicities, or religions.\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders encounter far fewer of these issues, as their\nregimes experience fewer abrupt changes. They face less pressure to dismantle the\nexisting ruling paradigm and establish a new order. Even when adjustments are\nnecessary, they have more time to implement changes gradually.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-leaders .cell tbl-cap='Main features of autocoup and coup-entry leaders'}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{75pt}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{187.5pt}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{187.5pt}}\n\\toprule\nFeature & Autocoup Leader & Coup Entry Leader \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nIllegitimacy & Normally attained through\nlawful procedures, but\nlacking consensus\nlegitimacy & Blatantly illegal \\\\ \n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Uncertainty}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Initially with some certainty, but decreases as the leader's age grows or health worsens}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Significant uncertainty initially}}} \\\\ \nInstability & Relatively stable & Unstable except when a strongman emerges or constitutional institutions are established \\\\ \n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Balance of Power}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Generally in a better position of power}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Initially unclear and challenging to establish a balance}}} \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n:::\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, coup-entry leaders face a significantly greater degree of the\nchallenges discussed earlier, placing them at a substantial disadvantage in the\npower dynamic compared to autocoup leaders. This disadvantage creates a\nself-perpetuating cycle. Weaker leaders struggle to attract and retain strong\nsupport, making them more vulnerable to internal and external challenges. The\nperception of risk discourages potential allies, further eroding their power\nbase.\n\nEmpirical evidence bolsters this dynamic. Data reveals a correlation between the\nfrequency of coup attempts in a country and the likelihood of future coups (e.g.,\n@tbl-coups shows over a third of coups occurring in the top ten countries with\nthe most attempts since 1950). This suggests that the more coups occur in a\ncountry, the more likely additional coups are to happen in the future.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts (1950–2023)'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.05\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.05\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lccr}\n\\toprule\nCountry & Coup Attempted & Coup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nBolivia & 23 & 11 & 47.8\\% \\\\ \nArgentina & 20 & 7 & 35.0\\% \\\\ \nSudan & 17 & 6 & 35.3\\% \\\\ \nHaiti & 13 & 9 & 69.2\\% \\\\ \nVenezuela & 13 & 0 & 0.0\\% \\\\ \nIraq & 12 & 4 & 33.3\\% \\\\ \nSyria & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nThailand & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nEcuador & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nBurundi & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nGuatemala & 10 & 5 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 491 & 245 & 49.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GIC dataset}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nConversely, autocoup leaders, often benefiting from a veneer of legitimacy and a\nstronger initial position, are better able to consolidate power and attract\nsupporters. This advantage can be self-reinforcing, as a strong power base\ndiscourages challenges and fosters loyalty. This dynamic is evident in cases like\nChina (2018), where the National People's Congress granted Xi Jinping the\npotential to rule for life[^2], and Russia (2020), where constitutional changes\nallow Putin to potentially remain in power until 2036[^3].\n\nThese features and the balance of power contribute to a shorter expected tenure\nfor coup-entry leaders compared to the relatively longer tenures of autocoup\nleaders. The average survival period following an autocoup is approximately five\nyears longer than that of coup-entry leaders (@fig-logrank). Based on these\nobservations and discussions, I propose the following hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups\n> are more likely to experience longer leadership survival compared to coup-entry\n> leaders.***\n\nIn the subsequent section, I will outline the research methodology used in this\npaper. I will introduce several control variables to determine if the hypothesis\nremains persistent and robust.\n\n## Research Design\n\n### Methodology: Survival analysis\n\nTo test the hypothesis, I will employ two Cox models to analyse the survival\ntenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. Unlike the Kaplan-Meier\nmodel, the Cox model enables the estimation of the impacts of multiple factors.\nAlthough it does not directly estimate the duration of tenure in office, it\nevaluates the hazard rate associated with being ousted from power. Essentially,\nthis represents different facets of the same phenomenon: as a leader's cumulative\nhazard of being ousted increases, their probability of survival in office\ndecreases.\n\nThe first model will utilize the Cox proportional hazards model (referred to as\nthe Cox PH model), where I will only use the variables present at the entry year,\nwithout considering the changes in these variables over the leaders' survival\ntimes.\n\nHowever, apart from the primary variable of interest in this research—the leader\ntype—control variables such as economic performance, Polity5 scores, and\npolitical stability do change over time. Therefore, the second model will account\nfor these variations by using the time-dependent Cox model.\n\n### Data\n\nThe main variables are as follows.\n\n#### Dependent variables\n\n-   **Survival Time:** The duration of a leader's tenure, measured in days. For\n    coup-entry leaders, the survival time begins on the day they assume power\n    through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time starts on the\n    expiration date of their original legitimate term. For example, Xi Jinping\n    assumed power in 2013 and removed term limits in 2018. His original\n    legitimate tenure was set to end in 2023, so his survival time begins in\n    2023, not 2013 or 2018, marking the start of his post-autocoup tenure. The\n    survival time concludes on the day the leader exits office, applicable to\n    both coup-entry and autocoup leaders.\n\n-   **End point status:** This variable indicates the manner in which the\n    leader's tenure concluded, categorized as follows:\n\n    -   **0 = Censored:** This status is assigned to leaders who leave office\n        through means other than being ousted. This includes leaders who appoint\n        their successors, opt for democratic transitions, or leave office due to\n        health issues or natural death.\n\n    -   **1 = Ousted:** This status is assigned to leaders who are forced out of\n        office. This includes cases where leaders \"voluntarily\" resign under\n        pressure, reflecting a de facto ousting by force.\n\n#### Key Independent variable: Leader type\n\nThis variable categorizes leaders into two distinct groups:\n\n-   Group A = Autocoup Leader: Leaders who extend their tenure through autocoups.\n-   Group B = Coup-Entry Leader: Leaders who assume power through coups.This\n    variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the\n    basis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.\n\nThe data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from @zhu2024\nand @goemans2009.\n\n#### Control variables\n\n-   **Economic Performance:** This variable is measured using two indicators:\n    economic level and economic growth rate.\n\n    -   **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides\n        an indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a\n        country.\n\n    -   **Economic Growth Trend:** Assessed using the current-trend (CT) ratio,\n        developed by @krishnarajan2019. The CT ratio compares a country's current\n        GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five\n        years. A higher CT ratio signifies stronger economic performance.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe GDP per capita data, expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP)\nand measured in units of \\$10,000, is sourced from the V-Dem dataset by\n@fariss2022. To account for the economic impact of the previous year, this data\nis lagged by one year.\n\n-   **Political Stability:** This variable captures overall regime stability by\n    including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and\n    interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the\n    Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall. This index provides\n    a comprehensive measure of the level of violence and conflict within a\n    country, which can significantly impact leadership survival.\n    [@marshall2005current].\n\n-   **Degree of Democracy:** The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5\n    scores at the entry year for each respective country. These scores range from\n    -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), capturing the extent of\n    democratic versus autocratic governance. This dataset is sourced from the\n    Center for Systemic Peace (CSP)[^4] and provides an essential measure of\n    political regime type, which can influence the stability and survival of\n    leaders in power.\n\n-   **Population Size:** To account for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,\n    the log of the population size is considered. This transformation helps in\n    managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The\n    data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its\n    influence on leadership survival. Larger populations may present more\n    governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting\n    the stability and longevity of a leader's tenure.\n\n-   **Leader's Age:** The age of the leader at the entry year is included as an\n    additional variable in the analysis, offering insights into potential\n    correlations with leadership survival. Older leaders may have different\n    experiences, networks, and health considerations that could influence their\n    ability to maintain power. This data is sourced from the leaders dataset by\n    [@goemans2009].\n\nBased on the methods and variables, we have the model as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nSurv(survival\\_time, status) &= Group + \\\\\n&GDP\\_growth\\_trend + GDP\\_per\\_capita + \\\\\n&pop\\_log + polity5 + Stability + age\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Model results\n\nUsing the @survival package in R, we present the regression results for both the\nCox PH model and the Time-dependent Cox model in Table @tbl-cox.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-cox .cell tbl-cap='Cox models for survival time of different types of leaders'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{lcccccccc}\n\\toprule\n & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Cox PH Model}} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Time-dependent Cox Model}} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule(lr){2-5} \\cmidrule(lr){6-9}\n\\textbf{Characteristic} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n{\\bfseries Leader Type} &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\\\ \n    Autocoup leaders & 72 & 28 & 1.00 & — & 734 & 27 & 1.00 & — \\\\ \n    Coup-entry leaders & 141 & 70 & 2.61*** & 0.266 & 794 & 72 & 2.42*** & 0.260 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP Growth Trend} & 213 & 98 & 0.91 & 0.911 & 1,528 & 99 & 0.17 & 1.07 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP per capita} & 213 & 98 & 0.97 & 0.020 & 1,528 & 99 & 0.94** & 0.026 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Population: log} & 213 & 98 & 0.91 & 0.088 & 1,528 & 99 & 0.86* & 0.082 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Polity 5} & 213 & 98 & 1.00 & 0.026 & 1,528 & 99 & 1.02 & 0.024 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Political stability} & 213 & 98 & 1.03 & 0.052 & 1,528 & 99 & 1.09 & 0.050 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Age} & 213 & 98 & 1.00 & 0.011 & 1,528 & 99 & 1.00 & 0.011 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}}*p\\textless{}0.05; **p\\textless{}0.01; ***p\\textless{}0.001\\\\\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}}HR = Hazard Ratio, SE = Standard Error\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, both the Cox PH model and time-dependent Cox model analyses\nrevealed a statistically significant association between leadership type and the\nhazard of removal from power. Coup-entry leaders were found to have a hazard\nratio of 2.42 (in time-dependent Cox model) compared to autocoup leaders\n(reference group), assuming all other variables in the model are held constant.\nThe analysis suggests that coup-entry leaders face a significantly greater risk\nof removal from power compared to autocoup leaders. At any given time during\ntheir tenure, coup-entry leaders are 2.42 times more likely to be ousted from\npower compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal in the model.\n\nAll other control variables in Cox PH model are not statistically significant. In\ntime-dependent Cox model, however, GDP per capita and the log of population are\nboth statistically significant at 5% level.\n\n-   **GDP per capita:** The hazard ratio of 0.94 indicates that for each unit\n    increase in GDP per capita (measured in constant 2017 international dollars,\n    PPP, in units of \\$10,000), the hazard (or risk) of being ousted at any given\n    time is reduced by 6%, assuming all other variables in the model are held\n    constant. Similarly, it indicates that for each unit increase in the log of\n    population, the hazard (or risk) of being oustedat any given time is reduced\n    by 14%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant.\n\n-   **Population:** The hazard ratio of 0.86 indicates that for each unit\n    increase in the logarithm of the population (one percent increase of\n    population), the hazard (or risk) of being ousted at any given time decreases\n    by 14%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant.\n\n### Discussion\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxSurv .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-1.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-2.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-2}\n:::\n\nSurvival curves for Cox Model\n:::\n\n\n\nThe survival curves depicted in @fig-coxSurv illustrate the survival rates for\nleaders of both types. Both the Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model and the\ntime-dependent model produce similar plots. Notably, the survival curve for\ncoup-entry leaders exhibits a significantly lower trajectory compared to that of\nautocoup leaders. The steeper drop at the early stage for coup-entry leaders\nindicates they are more likely to be ousted shortly after assuming power.\nAdditionally, the survival curve for coup-entry leaders crosses the median\nsurvival line much earlier than that of autocoup leaders. This disparity suggests\nthat autocoup leaders tend to remain in power for longer durations than their\ncoup-entry counterparts.\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxHR .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-1.pdf){#fig-coxHR-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-2.pdf){#fig-coxHR-2}\n:::\n\nHazard ratios and 95% CIs for Leader Ousting\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-coxHR displays the hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals\nfor the variables incorporated in the Cox model. Both the Cox Proportional\nHazards (PH) model and the time-dependent model yield nearly identical plots. The\nhazard ratio for coup-entry leaders compared to autocoup leaders is significantly\ngreater than 1 and statistically significant, indicating that coup-entry leaders\nare at a higher risk of being ousted. Most other variables have hazard ratios\nclose to 1, suggesting that a one-unit increase in these variables does not\nsignificantly affect the risk of being ousted. Although the hazard ratio for GDP\ngrowth trend is considerably less than 1, it is not statistically significant at\nthe 5% level. However, it is statistically significant at the 10% level,\nsuggesting that better economic performance may help to consolidate the rule of\nthe incumbents to some extent.\n\n@fig-coxHR presents the hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs) for the variables included in the Cox proportional\nhazards model (Cox PH) and the time-dependent model. The HR for coup-entry\nleaders compared to autocoup leaders is significantly greater than 1, indicating\na substantially higher risk of removal from power for coup-entry leaders. Most\nother variables have HRs close to 1, suggesting that a one-unit increase in those\nvariables has minimal impact on the risk of removal.\n\nThe HR for GDP growth trend is noteworthy. While it is considerably less than 1,\nit is statistically significant at the 10% level (0.10 \\> p-value \\> 0.05). This\nsuggests a possible trend where positive economic performance might reduce the\nrisk of removal from power for the incumbents, although the evidence is not\nconclusive.\n\n### Assessing the Proportional Hazards Assumption\n\nThe validity of the model assumptions significantly influences our confidence in\nthe results. To assess the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model, we\nuse the chi-square test based on Schoenfeld residuals to determine whether the\ncovariate effects remain constant (proportional) over time. Although the Cox PH\nmodel violates the proportional hazards assumption, our primary analysis relies\non the time-dependent Cox model, which does not show strong evidence of violating\nthe proportional hazards assumption for any covariate. The global p-value of\n0.382 is much greater than the 5% significance level, indicating that the\nproportional hazards assumption is reasonably met for the time-dependent Cox\nmodel.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study examined the survival durations of political leaders who come to power\nthrough irregular means, specifically coups and autocoups. We hypothesized that\nthe mode of accession significantly influences leader tenure. Employing survival\nanalysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a\ntime-dependent Cox model, we found strong evidence that autocoup leaders\ngenerally enjoy longer tenures than coup-entry leaders.\n\nOur findings revealed a significant difference in average tenure, with\npost-autocoup leaders averaging approximately 10.8 years in power compared to 5.4\nyears for coup-entry leaders. The time-dependent Cox model further indicated that\ncoup-entry leaders are 2.42 times more likely to be ousted from power at any\ngiven time compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal.\n\nThese results highlight the importance of understanding the phenomenon of\nautocoups, where leaders extend their rule by manipulating legal frameworks. Due\nto the relative ease and potential benefits of autocoups, this method of power\nretention might incentivize more leaders to employ it. Consequently, democratic\nbacksliding could become more prevalent as autocoups weaken democratic\ninstitutions and constitutional norms, particularly in nascent democracies or\nthose transitioning from autocracy.\n\nThis study contributes to the field of leadership survival by demonstrating that\nthe mode of accession significantly impacts leader tenure, a factor previously\nunder-explored in the literature. By utilizing both Cox models, the research\noffers robust analytical techniques for studying political leadership survival\nand provides strong evidence of divergent tenure lengths between these two types\nof irregular-entry leaders.\n\nHowever, limitations exist. The study relies heavily on the autocoup dataset\ncollected and coded by the author. The concept and data itself are relatively\nnovel within academia. Future research should refine and establish wider\nrecognition for the term \"autocoup,\" leading to more accurate and comprehensive\ndata collection efforts. Expanding the dataset to include more cases and\nintegrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions could yield a\nmore holistic understanding of political survival in such contexts.\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n[^1]: https://thediplomat.com/2023/08/myanmar-junta-extends-state-of-emergency-for-fourth-time/:\n    Myanmar\\\n    Junta Extends State of Emergency for Fourth Time.
