The central hypothesis posits that the mode of accession to power influences the duration of their tenures. Utilizing survival analysis, the results indicate that leaders who overstay their terms through autocoups generally remain in power longer than those who come to power through coups.\n\nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Survival, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe survival of political leaders has been a well-studied topic in political\nscience. However, two specific types of leaders - those who come to power through\ncoups and those who overstay their legitimate terms (autocoup leaders) - have\nreceived comparatively less attention. Examining the tenures of these irregularly\nascended leaders holds particular significance for two main reasons.\n\nFirstly, leaders who ascend through irregular means constitute the majority of\nirregular exits from power. According to @goemans2009, between 1945 and 2015, out\nof 1,472 leaders who assumed office through regular channels, approximately 213\nexited irregularly (14.5%). Conversely, out of 308 leaders who assumed office\nthrough irregular means, roughly 158 (51.3%) experienced irregular exits.\n\nSecondly, among irregularly ascended leaders, the majority gained power through\nlaunching coups or overstaying in office. As per @goemans2009, out of 374 leaders\nwho exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, constituting 65.8% of\nthese cases. Additionally, between 1945 and 2020, there were 106 attempts to\noverstay in power, of which 86 were successful [@Zhu2024]. Leaders who extend\ntheir legitimate term limits essentially stage coups against legitimate\nsuccessors, thereby qualifying as autocoup leaders. Hence, it is both relevant\nand insightful to delve into and compare the tenures of coup-entry leaders and\nautocoup leaders.\n\nWhile it is expected that autocoup leaders survive longer than coup-entry leaders\nwhen considering their total tenures, a more insightful comparison arises when\nexamining the tenures following autocoups in contrast to those of coup-entry\nleaders. Conducting a log-rank test in survival analysis on the leaders dataset\n[@goemans2009] and the author's autocoup dataset @zhu2024\\] reveals a distinct\ncontrast between autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMydata1 <- read.csv(here(\"data/mydata1.csv\")) |> \n  mutate(survival_year = survival_time / 365)\n\navg <- Mydata1 |>\n  summarise(avg=round(mean(survival_year),1),\n            .by = group)\n\navg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"group\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"avg\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"A\",\"2\":\"10.9\"},{\"1\":\"B\",\"2\":\"5.3\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit survival curves\nfit <- survfit(Surv(survival_year, status) ~ group, data = Mydata1)\n# Create log-rank plot (Kaplan-Meier plot)\nggsurvplot(fit, \n           data = Mydata1, \n           risk.table = TRUE, \n           risk.table.height = 0.3, \n           pval = TRUE,\n           surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n           break.x.by = 5, \n           legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n           legend.labs = c(\"entry by autocoup\", \"entry by coup\"),\n           xlab = \"Survival Years\",\n           #title = \"Survival Curves of overstay and coup-entry leaders\",\n           font.title = 14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-html/fig-logrank-1.png){#fig-logrank fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPreliminary findings from survival analysis (see @fig-logrank) indicate a\nsignificant difference. Leaders who consolidate power through autocoups appear to\nhave a longer average tenure after the autocoup itself (approximately\n10.9) compared to coup leaders (approximately 5.3). This\nsuggests a potential shortfall of 5 years in the average tenure of coup leaders.\n\nThus, we hypothesize that the method of accession significantly influences\nleadership longevity. Coup leaders likely face greater challenges to their\nlegitimacy, leading to a more precarious initial period in power. They may\nencounter higher levels of uncertainty, instability, and pressure to share power,\nall of which could contribute to a shorter average tenure compared to autocoup\nleaders.\n\nBy employing the Cox proportional hazards model and the extended Cox model, the\nresults suggest that leaders who exceed their term limits generally experience\nlonger tenures compared to those who come to power through coups.\n\nThis study offers two key contributions. First, it highlights a critical factor\noften overlooked in leadership survival studies: the impact of accession method.\nLeaders' survival is not solely determined by their actions after taking power,\nbut also by the way they acquired power in the first place. This research\nunderscores the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and\ncoup leaders. Second, it provides empirical measurements to compare the tenure\nduration of these two irregularly ascended leaders, offering insights into their\ndistinct impacts on leadership longevity.\n\nThe remainder of the paper delves deeper into this topic. Chapter 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Chapter 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyse the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a\ndetailed discussion of the results. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by synthesizing\nthe key takeaways and exploring their broader implications.\n\n## Literature review\n\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science\nresearch for decades. This enduring interest stems from the vast variations\nobserved across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Before delving deeper\ninto the subject, it is crucial to distinguish between two distinct yet\ninterconnected concepts: regime survival and individual leader survival.\n\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as\nmonarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader\nsurvival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual\nleaders' time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns.\nFor example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific\npolitical parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders\n(Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see\nlong-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a slower\npace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some military\nregimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party and the head of\ngovernment. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of individual\nleader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how long leaders remain in\npower.\n\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a\nwealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific\nmechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as\ndemocracies or autocracies. Others seek to develop more generalizable theoretical\nframeworks that can explain leader survival across diverse political systems.\nWhile the development of a universal theory remains an alluring goal, it is\nimportant to acknowledge the inherent challenges in creating a single model that\nencompasses the complexities of leadership survival across all regime types.\n\n**Transparent and inclusive vs. Opaque and exclusive**\n\n**First of all**, the mechanisms governing power transitions differ dramatically\nin different countries, particularly between democracies and autocracies. The key\ndistinctions in the leadership selection process can be characterized as follows:\ntransparent vs. opaque and inclusive vs. exclusive.\n\nIn many autocratic systems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential\ncandidates are often restricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families,\nmilitary elites, or members of the ruling party. Selection processes are shrouded\nin secrecy, and dissent can be met with harsh consequences. Even elections exist\nin some autocracies, like Russia, there may have significant barriers to entry\nfor legitimate challengers. Potential rivals may face threats like assassination,\nimprisonment, or exile.\n\nThis lack of transparency makes it difficult to gauge true levels of public\nsupport as in democracies. Calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as\nexplored by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes a near-impossible task. Leadership\ntransitions in autocracies often hinge on internal power struggles rather than\npublic opinion. A dictator may retain power despite low public support.\n\nIn contrast, democracies have relatively open competition for leadership\npositions. Challengers can openly campaign and garner support through public\nspeeches, media campaigns, and grassroots movements. If no single candidate\ncommands a majority, factions can collaborate, leading to power transitions with\nbroader public backing. This allows for a more accurate assessment of power\ndynamics through public opinion polls and electoral performance.\n\n**Regular and predictable vs. Irregular and unpredictable**\n\n**Secondly,** beyond the differences in openness and inclusivity, leadership\ntransitions in autocracies and some democracies are far more irregular and\nunpredictable compared to stable democracies.\n\nMany autocratic regimes lack institutionalized mechanisms for succession or term\nlimits. A leader's tenure often hinges on their ability to maintain control and\nconsolidate power. Certain dictators maintain an indefinite grip on power until\ntheir death, subsequently transferring authority to family members, such as sons\nin the cases of Syria and North Korea, or brothers in Cuba. This can also lead to\nunexpected and irregular leadership changes. Leaders may be ousted through coups,\nrebellions, uprisings, or popular protests. The opacity surrounding power\ndynamics can also contribute to instability. Even seemingly strong leaders can be\noverthrown by a small, well-positioned faction within the regime. Take, for\ninstance, Henri Namphy, who assumed the presidency of Haiti following a coup in\nJune 1988, only to be ousted by another coup a mere three months later in\nSeptember of the same year. However, Qaddafi, the dictator of Libya, seized power\nin a coup in 1969 and ruled for over 40 years before being killed in 2011 by\nNATO-backed rebel forces [@goemans2009].\n\nIn contrast, stable democracies experience regular and predictable leadership\ntransitions. Formal institutions, such as term limits, set clear boundaries for\nhow long leaders can remain in office. For example, US presidents are limited to\na maximum of two terms, regardless of their popularity. Similarly, in autocratic\nMexico from 1919 to 2000, each president served a fixed six-year term without\nfacing overthrows or overstays, as noted by [@klesner2019].\n\nThe study of political survival is particularly captivating due to the\nintricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular leadership transitions.\nWhile regular and anticipated leadership changes are important, they offer less\nfertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader longevity. The vast majority\nof leaders who assume power through established channels also exit power through\nestablished mechanisms [@goemans2009]. This research delves into the factors\ninfluencing the survival of leaders who achieve power through irregular means, as\nthese transitions often hinge on complex political calculations, power struggles,\nand unforeseen events.\n\nDue to the above discussions, the diverse mechanisms influencing political\nleadership survival have prompted scholars to delve deeper into regime-specific\ndynamics. For instance, research by @svolik2014 examines democracies, while\n@davenport2021 focuses on autocracies. A particular more focus lies on\nunderstanding unexpected tenures, where leaders either fail to complete their\nterms or overstay their mandates.\n\nIn analysing dterminants of leader survival, two primary perspectives have been\nused to explain leader survival. The first considers contextual factors and\nresources available to leaders. These include elements like personal competence\n[@yu2016], societal stability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999;\n@williams2011], access to natural resources [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012;\n@wright2013], and external support networks[@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017].\nThe second perspective explores the strategies leaders employ to implement their\nagendas. This includes both the leaders' political goals and their responses to\nopposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions [@gandhi2007; @morrison2009;\n@escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].\n\nUnsurprisingly, coups have received significant scholarly attention due to their\nrole in removing authoritarian leaders [@svolik2009; @frantz2016]. Existing\nresearch explores both strategies for thwarting coups [@powell2017; @sudduth2017;\n@debruin2020] and how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup attempts\n[@easton2018]. For example, @sudduth2017a examines the post-coup actions of\ndictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders initially\nhold more power than elites within the regime, making them less susceptible to\nsubsequent coups. This challenges the conventional view of new leaders as\ninherently weak [@roessler2011]. Despite this distinction, both Sudduth and\nRoessler acknowledge that new leaders often consolidate power by purging rivals\n(Sudduth suggests this occurs when there is minimal risk, while Roessler argues\nit happens when threats are perceived). While the debate on the initial strength\nof coup leaders continues, both perspectives agree that early purges are more\nlikely.\n\n@sudduth2018 investigates how leaders' entry methods affect their removal in\ndictatorships. They argue that irregular entry does not necessarily increase the\nlikelihood of removal. In fact, some forms of irregular entry may offer\nprotection. However, their focus was on how leaders lose office, not how long\nthey stay in power. Additionally, they compared six types of irregular leaders\nwithout specifically examining the distinction between coup-entry and autocoup\nleaders.\n\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts,\nincluding universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed\nchallenges, a significant gap remains. There is a lack of research specifically\nexploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their tenures\nthrough autocoups compared to those who come to power through coups d'état. This\nstudy aims to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of\nleadership survival between these two distinct leader types.\n\n\n\n",
