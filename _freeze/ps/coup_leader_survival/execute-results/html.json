The central hypothesis posits that the mode of accession to power influences the duration of their tenures. Utilizing survival analysis, the results indicate that leaders who overstay their terms through autocoups generally remain in power longer than those who come to power through coups.\n\nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Survival, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe survival of political leaders has been a well-studied topic in political\nscience. However, two specific types of leaders - those who come to power through\ncoups and those who overstay their legitimate terms (autocoup leaders) - have\nreceived comparatively less attention. Examining the tenures of these irregularly\nascended leaders holds particular significance for two main reasons.\n\nFirstly, leaders who ascend through irregular means constitute the majority of\nirregular exits from power. According to @goemans2009, between 1945 and 2015, out\nof 1,472 leaders who assumed office through regular channels, approximately 213\nexited irregularly (14.5%). Conversely, out of 308 leaders who assumed office\nthrough irregular means, roughly 158 (51.3%) experienced irregular exits.\n\nSecondly, among irregularly ascended leaders, the majority gained power through\nlaunching coups or overstaying in office. As per @goemans2009, out of 374 leaders\nwho exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, constituting 65.8% of\nthese cases. Additionally, between 1945 and 2020, there were 106 attempts to\noverstay in power, of which 86 were successful [@Zhu2024]. Leaders who extend\ntheir legitimate term limits essentially stage coups against legitimate\nsuccessors, thereby qualifying as autocoup leaders. Hence, it is both relevant\nand insightful to delve into and compare the tenures of coup-entry leaders and\nautocoup leaders.\n\nWhile it is expected that autocoup leaders survive longer than coup-entry leaders\nwhen considering their total tenures, a more insightful comparison arises when\nexamining the tenures following autocoups in contrast to those of coup-entry\nleaders. Conducting a log-rank test in survival analysis on the leaders dataset\n[@goemans2009] and the author's autocoup dataset @zhu2024\\] reveals a distinct\ncontrast between autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMydata1 <- read.csv(here(\"data/mydata1.csv\")) |> \n  mutate(survival_year = survival_time / 365)\n\navg <- Mydata1 |>\n  summarise(avg=round(mean(survival_year),1),\n            .by = group)\n\navg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"group\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"avg\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"A\",\"2\":\"10.9\"},{\"1\":\"B\",\"2\":\"5.3\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit survival curves\nfit <- survfit(Surv(survival_year, status) ~ group, data = Mydata1)\n# Create log-rank plot (Kaplan-Meier plot)\nggsurvplot(fit, \n           data = Mydata1, \n           risk.table = TRUE, \n           risk.table.height = 0.3, \n           pval = TRUE,\n           surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n           break.x.by = 5, \n           legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n           legend.labs = c(\"entry by autocoup\", \"entry by coup\"),\n           xlab = \"Survival Years\",\n           #title = \"Survival Curves of overstay and coup-entry leaders\",\n           font.title = 14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-html/fig-logrank-1.png){#fig-logrank fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPreliminary findings from survival analysis (see @fig-logrank) indicate a\nsignificant difference. Leaders who consolidate power through autocoups appear to\nhave a longer average tenure after the autocoup itself (approximately\n10.9) compared to coup leaders (approximately 5.3). This\nsuggests a potential shortfall of 5 years in the average tenure of coup leaders.\n\nThus, we hypothesize that the method of accession significantly influences\nleadership longevity. Coup leaders likely face greater challenges to their\nlegitimacy, leading to a more precarious initial period in power. They may\nencounter higher levels of uncertainty, instability, and pressure to share power,\nall of which could contribute to a shorter average tenure compared to autocoup\nleaders.\n\nBy employing the Cox proportional hazards model and the extended Cox model, the\nresults suggest that leaders who exceed their term limits generally experience\nlonger tenures compared to those who come to power through coups.\n\nThis study offers two key contributions. First, it highlights a critical factor\noften overlooked in leadership survival studies: the impact of accession method.\nLeaders' survival is not solely determined by their actions after taking power,\nbut also by the way they acquired power in the first place. This research\nunderscores the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and\ncoup leaders. Second, it provides empirical measurements to compare the tenure\nduration of these two irregularly ascended leaders, offering insights into their\ndistinct impacts on leadership longevity.\n\nThe remainder of the paper delves deeper into this topic. Chapter 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Chapter 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a\ndetailed discussion of the results. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by synthesizing\nthe key takeaways and exploring their broader implications.\n\n\n\n",
