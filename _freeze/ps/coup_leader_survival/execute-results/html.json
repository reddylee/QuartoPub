The central hypothesis posits that the mode of accession to power influences the duration of their tenures. Utilizing survival analysis, the results indicate that leaders who overstay their terms through autocoups generally remain in power longer than those who come to power through coups.\n\nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Survival, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe survival of political leaders has been a well-studied topic in political\nscience. However, two specific types of leaders - those who come to power through\ncoups and those who overstay their legitimate terms (autocoup leaders) - have\nreceived comparatively less attention. Examining the tenures of these irregularly\nascended leaders holds particular significance for two main reasons.\n\nFirstly, leaders who ascend through irregular means constitute the majority of\nirregular exits from power. According to @goemans2009, between 1945 and 2015, out\nof 1,472 leaders who assumed office through regular channels, approximately 213\nexited irregularly (14.5%). Conversely, out of 308 leaders who assumed office\nthrough irregular means, roughly 158 (51.3%) experienced irregular exits.\n\nSecondly, among irregularly ascended leaders, the majority gained power through\nlaunching coups or overstaying in office. As per @goemans2009, out of 374 leaders\nwho exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, constituting 65.8% of\nthese cases. Additionally, between 1945 and 2020, there were 106 attempts to\noverstay in power, of which 86 were successful [@zhu2024]. Leaders who extend\ntheir legitimate term limits essentially stage coups against legitimate\nsuccessors, thereby qualifying as autocoup leaders. Hence, it is both relevant\nand insightful to delve into and compare the tenures of coup-entry leaders and\nautocoup leaders.\n\nWhile it is expected that autocoup leaders survive longer than coup-entry leaders\nwhen considering their total tenures, a more insightful comparison arises when\nexamining the tenures following autocoups in contrast to those of coup-entry\nleaders. Conducting a log-rank test in survival analysis on the leaders dataset\n[@goemans2009] and the author's autocoup dataset @zhu2024\\] reveals a distinct\ncontrast between autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nMydata1 <- read.csv(here(\"data/mydata1.csv\")) |> \n  mutate(survival_year = survival_time / 365)\n\navg <- Mydata1 |>\n  summarise(avg=round(mean(survival_year),1),\n            .by = group)\n\navg\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<div data-pagedtable=\"false\">\n  <script data-pagedtable-source type=\"application/json\">\n{\"columns\":[{\"label\":[\"group\"],\"name\":[1],\"type\":[\"chr\"],\"align\":[\"left\"]},{\"label\":[\"avg\"],\"name\":[2],\"type\":[\"dbl\"],\"align\":[\"right\"]}],\"data\":[{\"1\":\"A\",\"2\":\"10.9\"},{\"1\":\"B\",\"2\":\"5.3\"}],\"options\":{\"columns\":{\"min\":{},\"max\":[10]},\"rows\":{\"min\":[10],\"max\":[10]},\"pages\":{}}}\n  </script>\n</div>\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit survival curves\nfit <- survfit(Surv(survival_year, status) ~ group, data = Mydata1)\n# Create log-rank plot (Kaplan-Meier plot)\nggsurvplot(fit, \n           data = Mydata1, \n           risk.table = TRUE, \n           risk.table.height = 0.3, \n           pval = TRUE,\n           surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n           break.x.by = 5, \n           legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n           legend.labs = c(\"entry by autocoup\", \"entry by coup\"),\n           xlab = \"Survival Years\",\n           #title = \"Survival Curves of overstay and coup-entry leaders\",\n           font.title = 14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coup_leader_survival_files/figure-html/fig-logrank-1.png){#fig-logrank fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPreliminary findings from survival analysis (see @fig-logrank) indicate a\nsignificant difference. Leaders who consolidate power through autocoups appear to\nhave a longer average tenure after the autocoup itself (approximately\n10.9) compared to coup leaders (approximately 5.3). This\nsuggests a potential shortfall of 5 years in the average tenure of coup leaders.\n\nThus, we hypothesize that the method of accession significantly influences\nleadership longevity. Coup leaders likely face greater challenges to their\nlegitimacy, leading to a more precarious initial period in power. They may\nencounter higher levels of uncertainty, instability, and pressure to share power,\nall of which could contribute to a shorter average tenure compared to autocoup\nleaders.\n\nBy employing the Cox proportional hazards model and the extended Cox model, the\nresults suggest that leaders who exceed their term limits generally experience\nlonger tenures compared to those who come to power through coups.\n\nThis study offers two key contributions. First, it highlights a critical factor\noften overlooked in leadership survival studies: the impact of accession method.\nLeaders' survival is not solely determined by their actions after taking power,\nbut also by the way they acquired power in the first place. This research\nunderscores the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and\ncoup leaders. Second, it provides empirical measurements to compare the tenure\nduration of these two irregularly ascended leaders, offering insights into their\ndistinct impacts on leadership longevity.\n\nThe remainder of the paper delves deeper into this topic. Chapter 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Chapter 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyse the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a\ndetailed discussion of the results. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by synthesizing\nthe key takeaways and exploring their broader implications.\n\n## Literature review\n\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science\nresearch for decades. This enduring interest stems from the vast variations\nobserved across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Before delving deeper\ninto the subject, it is crucial to distinguish between two distinct yet\ninterconnected concepts: regime survival and individual leader survival.\n\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as\nmonarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader\nsurvival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual\nleaders' time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns.\nFor example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific\npolitical parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders\n(Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see\nlong-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a slower\npace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some military\nregimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party and the head of\ngovernment. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of individual\nleader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how long leaders remain in\npower.\n\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a\nwealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific\nmechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as\ndemocracies or autocracies. Others seek to develop more generalizable theoretical\nframeworks that can explain leader survival across diverse political systems.\nWhile the development of a universal theory remains an alluring goal, it is\nimportant to acknowledge the inherent challenges in creating a single model that\nencompasses the complexities of leadership survival across all regime types.\n\n**Transparent and inclusive vs. Opaque and exclusive**\n\n**First of all**, the mechanisms governing power transitions differ dramatically\nin different countries, particularly between democracies and autocracies. The key\ndistinctions in the leadership selection process can be characterized as follows:\ntransparent vs. opaque and inclusive vs. exclusive.\n\nIn many autocratic systems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential\ncandidates are often restricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families,\nmilitary elites, or members of the ruling party. Selection processes are shrouded\nin secrecy, and dissent can be met with harsh consequences. Even elections exist\nin some autocracies, like Russia, there may have significant barriers to entry\nfor legitimate challengers. Potential rivals may face threats like assassination,\nimprisonment, or exile.\n\nThis lack of transparency makes it difficult to gauge true levels of public\nsupport as in democracies. Calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as\nexplored by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes a near-impossible task. Leadership\ntransitions in autocracies often hinge on internal power struggles rather than\npublic opinion. A dictator may retain power despite low public support.\n\nIn contrast, democracies have relatively open competition for leadership\npositions. Challengers can openly campaign and garner support through public\nspeeches, media campaigns, and grassroots movements. If no single candidate\ncommands a majority, factions can collaborate, leading to power transitions with\nbroader public backing. This allows for a more accurate assessment of power\ndynamics through public opinion polls and electoral performance.\n\n**Regular and predictable vs. Irregular and unpredictable**\n\n**Secondly,** beyond the differences in openness and inclusivity, leadership\ntransitions in autocracies and some democracies are far more irregular and\nunpredictable compared to stable democracies.\n\nMany autocratic regimes lack institutionalized mechanisms for succession or term\nlimits. A leader's tenure often hinges on their ability to maintain control and\nconsolidate power. Certain dictators maintain an indefinite grip on power until\ntheir death, subsequently transferring authority to family members, such as sons\nin the cases of Syria and North Korea, or brothers in Cuba. This can also lead to\nunexpected and irregular leadership changes. Leaders may be ousted through coups,\nrebellions, uprisings, or popular protests. The opacity surrounding power\ndynamics can also contribute to instability. Even seemingly strong leaders can be\noverthrown by a small, well-positioned faction within the regime. Take, for\ninstance, Henri Namphy, who assumed the presidency of Haiti following a coup in\nJune 1988, only to be ousted by another coup a mere three months later in\nSeptember of the same year. However, Qaddafi, the dictator of Libya, seized power\nin a coup in 1969 and ruled for over 40 years before being killed in 2011 by\nNATO-backed rebel forces [@goemans2009].\n\nIn contrast, stable democracies experience regular and predictable leadership\ntransitions. Formal institutions, such as term limits, set clear boundaries for\nhow long leaders can remain in office. For example, US presidents are limited to\na maximum of two terms, regardless of their popularity. Similarly, in autocratic\nMexico from 1919 to 2000, each president served a fixed six-year term without\nfacing overthrows or overstays, as noted by [@klesner2019].\n\nThe study of political survival is particularly captivating due to the\nintricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular leadership transitions.\nWhile regular and anticipated leadership changes are important, they offer less\nfertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader longevity. The vast majority\nof leaders who assume power through established channels also exit power through\nestablished mechanisms [@goemans2009]. This research delves into the factors\ninfluencing the survival of leaders who achieve power through irregular means, as\nthese transitions often hinge on complex political calculations, power struggles,\nand unforeseen events.\n\nDue to the above discussions, the diverse mechanisms influencing political\nleadership survival have prompted scholars to delve deeper into regime-specific\ndynamics. For instance, research by @svolik2014 examines democracies, while\n@davenport2021 focuses on autocracies. A particular more focus lies on\nunderstanding unexpected tenures, where leaders either fail to complete their\nterms or overstay their mandates.\n\nIn analysing dterminants of leader survival, two primary perspectives have been\nused to explain leader survival. The first considers contextual factors and\nresources available to leaders. These include elements like personal competence\n[@yu2016], societal stability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999;\n@williams2011], access to natural resources [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012;\n@wright2013], and external support networks[@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017].\nThe second perspective explores the strategies leaders employ to implement their\nagendas. This includes both the leaders' political goals and their responses to\nopposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions [@gandhi2007; @morrison2009;\n@escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].\n\nUnsurprisingly, coups have received significant scholarly attention due to their\nrole in removing authoritarian leaders [@svolik2009; @frantz2016]. Existing\nresearch explores both strategies for thwarting coups [@powell2017; @sudduth2017;\n@debruin2020] and how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup attempts\n[@easton2018]. For example, @sudduth2017a examines the post-coup actions of\ndictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders initially\nhold more power than elites within the regime, making them less susceptible to\nsubsequent coups. This challenges the conventional view of new leaders as\ninherently weak [@roessler2011]. Despite this distinction, both Sudduth and\nRoessler acknowledge that new leaders often consolidate power by purging rivals\n(Sudduth suggests this occurs when there is minimal risk, while Roessler argues\nit happens when threats are perceived). While the debate on the initial strength\nof coup leaders continues, both perspectives agree that early purges are more\nlikely.\n\n@sudduth2018 investigates how leaders' entry methods affect their removal in\ndictatorships. They argue that irregular entry does not necessarily increase the\nlikelihood of removal. In fact, some forms of irregular entry may offer\nprotection. However, their focus was on how leaders lose office, not how long\nthey stay in power. Additionally, they compared six types of irregular leaders\nwithout specifically examining the distinction between coup-entry and autocoup\nleaders.\n\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts,\nincluding universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed\nchallenges, a significant gap remains. There is a lack of research specifically\nexploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their tenures\nthrough autocoups compared to those who come to power through coups d'état. This\nstudy aims to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of\nleadership survival between these two distinct leader types.\n\n## Survival dynamics of autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders\n\n### Autocoup leader and coup-entry leader\n\nAs highlighted in Chapter 2, investigating leadership survival presents inherent\nchallenges due to factors such as the opacity and varied mechanisms of power\ntransitions. However, these challenges underscore the importance of this\nresearch, as it provides insights into understudied dynamics.\n\nWhile the succession of political leaders exhibits complexity and variation, it\nis not entirely devoid of patterns. Leaders of similar types often display\nsignificant comparability. This study leverages this comparative approach to\nanalyse the ruling tenures of two distinct leader categories: coup-entry leaders\nand autocoup leaders.\n\nThis study defines an autocoup as a situation where an incumbent leader utilizes\nillegitimate or unconstitutional methods to extend their tenure and remain in\npower. An autocoup is deemed successful if this power extension lasts for at\nleast six months. Coups d'état, on the other hand, are defined as illegal and\novert attempts by the military or other powerful groups within the state to\nunseat the sitting leader [@powell2011]. Similar to coups, successful autocoups\nin this study will be measured by a power usurpation lasting at least six months,\ndiffering from the seven-day duration coded by Powell and Thyne.\n\nIt is also important to clarify the distinction between an autocoup leader and a\ncoup-entry leader, as the topic of this study is the survival of leaders.\n\n-   **Autocoup Leader:** This refers to an incumbent leader who successfully uses\n    illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. In an\n    autocoup, the leader orchestrates the power grab and continues to rule\n    afterwards.\n\n-   **Coup-Entry Leader:** This term designates the leader who assumes power\n    after a successful coup d'état. Unlike in autocoups, coups often involve\n    multiple coup leaders (individuals or groups) who overthrow the incumbent\n    leader. The coup-entry leader is the individual who ultimately takes the\n    reins of power after the coup succeeds. While coup leaders may play a role in\n    selecting the coup-entry leader, this is not always the case. In some\n    instances, they may support someone outside the coup plot to become the new\n    leader. Regardless of the selection process, the coup-entry leader is the one\n    who assumes formal leadership following a successful coup.\n\nAs autocoup leaders normally exhibit longer overall tenures compared to\ncoup-entry leaders, this study concentrates on a more nuanced comparison.\nSpecifically, we will analyze the **post-autocoup** tenure of autocoup leaders,\ncontrasting it with the tenure of coup-entry leaders. This study examines the\nsurvival tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders for three key\nreasons:\n\n-   **Illegitimacy:** Both leader types lack legitimacy, though it manifests\n    differently. Coup leaders seize power through force or the threat of force,\n    making their illegitimacy explicit. Autocoups often employ seemingly legal\n    procedures like court rulings or votes, but these processes are frequently\n    manipulated by incumbents leveraging their control [@zhu2024]. This\n    perception of illegitimacy can be used to justify the removal of such\n    leaders, even if the means of removal are themselves illegitimate.\n\n-   **Uncertainty:** The irregular means by which coup-entry and autocoup leaders\n    take or retain power create significant uncertainty regarding their long-term\n    rule and eventual exit. The established power transition process is\n    undermined, raising questions about whether these leaders will enact\n    constitutional succession protocols, and if so, whether those protocols will\n    be followed. This ambiguity affects not only elites and citizens but also the\n    leaders themselves, who face ongoing uncertainties about when, how, and to\n    whom power might be transferred. Historical data on irregular leaders\n    supports this point. Leader dataset shows that over half of irregular leaders\n    experience irregular exits, and coup-related exits constitute more than\n    two-thirds of all irregular exits [@goemans2009]. Furthermore, @frantz2016\n    show that coup-related exits account for roughly one-third of all exits in\n    autocracies, surpassing any other type, including regular transitions.\n\n-   **Instability:** Coup-entry and autocoup leaders are aware of their own\n    legitimacy and uncertainty challenges, which can fuel insecurity and a sense\n    of crisis. In attempts to consolidate power, they may resort to reshuffling\n    power structures or purging potential challengers. However, these efforts to\n    maintain stability and strengthen their position often backfire, triggering\n    greater instability.\n\nThe interplay of illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability creates a complex\nenvironment that significantly influences leader tenure.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nWhile both coup-entry and autocoup leaders face similar challenges – lack of\nlegitimacy, irregularity, and fostering uncertainty – the severity of these\nchallenges often differ. Coup-entry leaders typically encounter these obstacles\nto a greater degree. Consequently, they are expected to have shorter tenures in\npower compared to autocoup leaders.\n\n#### Legitimacy\n\nCoup-entry leaders face an inherent legitimacy gap due to their sudden, often\nviolent, and unconstitutional rise to power. This approach is widely viewed as\nillegal and sets a dangerous precedent, encouraging others to attempt similar\ntakeovers. Haiti's history exemplifies this, with Henri Namphy's brief presidency\nin 1988 being cut short by another coup just three months later [@goemans2009].\nBeyond immediate internal power grabs, coups can embolden external actors to\nintervene, potentially leading to uprisings, revolutions, and civil wars\n[@dahl2023].\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders manipulate power transition processes to extend\ntheir rule, often through constitutional reinterpretations, engineered\nparliamentary votes, or influenced Supreme Court decisions. These actions lack\ngenuine legitimacy as they exploit power and use illegal measures like silencing\nopposition. Although their legitimacy is also contested, autocoup leaders\nmaintain a superficial veneer of legality, forcing challengers to operate within\nlegal frameworks. Replicating autocoup is more challenging than staging a coup\nbecause it requires holding a leadership position first.\n\nFurthermore, overthrowing incumbents who overstay in power through autocoups\npresents significant hurdles due to the incumbent's power advantage. This\nadvantage is evident in cases like China (2018), where the National People's\nCongress granted Xi Jinping the potential to rule for life[^1], and Russia\n(2020), where constitutional changes allow Putin to potentially remain in power\nuntil 2036[^2]. These actions demonstrate the consolidation of power by\nincumbents, even if they do not reflect genuine public support.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup

different levels of uncertainty immediately\nfollowing their rise to or overstay power.\n\nAfter a coup, at least three major uncertainties arise regarding leadership and\nits tenure. First, it is unclear who will assume leadership. Although coup\nleaders often take power, some may return or promise to return power to civilian\nleaders. Even among coup leaders, determining who will lead can be problematic,\nas coup plotters are sometimes a group without a clear core leader. For instance,\nfollowing the 1973 Chilean coup, the initial plan for a rotating presidency among\nmilitary leaders was abandoned when General Pinochet consolidated control and\nremained in power until 1990 [@svolik2014]. Second, the duration of the coup\nleader's rule is uncertain. Leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt (1954 coup),\nMuammar Gaddafi in Libya (1969 coup), and Idi Amin in Uganda (1971 coup) aimed to\nretain power for life [@geddes2018], but their ability to do so was uncertain.\nOthers promise to transfer power to civilian authorities, but the timing and\nfulfillment of these promises are unclear. For example, Myanmar's military junta\n(2021 coup) has repeatedly extended a state of emergency, clinging to power\nbeyond the promised time-frame[^3]. Conversely, after the 2010 coup in Niger, the\nmilitary honoured their promise by restoring civilian rule within the same year\n[@ginsburg2019]. Third, the successors of coup leaders are uncertain. Some may\ndesignate successors from their inner circle, including family members, while\nothers may support general elections, though whether this will be fulfilled as\nintended remains uncertain.\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders present a clearer picture regarding leadership and\ntenure. There is no uncertainty about who will rule after an autocoup. In the\nmedium term, autocoup leaders typically hold office themselves. Many, like Putin\nin Russia and Xi Jinping in China, seek to extend their rule indefinitely and are\nunlikely to relinquish power voluntarily. Others attempt to extend their terms\nincrementally, such as President Menem of Argentina, who overstayed until 1993\nbut failed in his bid for another term in 1999 [@llanos2019].\n\n### Instability\n\nThe stability of a regime, particularly in an autocracy, hinges on maintaining a\nbalance of power. Coups, however, inevitably disrupt this balance, even when they\nare bloodless, necessitating the creation of a new equilibrium. The ousting of\nprevious rulers requires dismantling the established governing structure and\nreshuffling high-ranking officials, actions that inherently generate instability\nand create adversaries for the new leadership. This makes restoring order and\nestablishing a balanced power structure notably challenging. Studies show that\nnew leaders often purge rival elite groups to consolidate their power at the\noutset of their tenure [@sudduth2017; @roessler2011]. Such actions can provoke\nbacklash even from close allies. For instance, in Uganda, President Obote's\nattempt to undermine the army commander-in-chief, Idi Amin, led to Amin gaining\nthe army's support and ultimately ousting Obote in a 1971 coup. Similarly, in\nPakistan in 1999, shortly after Prime Minister Sharif dismissed powerful army\nchief General Pervez Musharraf, Sharif himself was ousted in a coup orchestrated\nby Musharraf and his supporters [@sudduth2017].\n\nTo consolidate power, coup-entry leaders often have to compromise with internal\nor external power challengers. However, these compromises are frequently unstable\nand easily broken. The situation becomes even more complex when there is a risk\nof civil war. Leaders may attempt to reduce the likelihood of subsequent coups,\npotentially increasing the chances of societal rebellions and civil wars\n[@roessler2011].\n\nMoreover, instability extends beyond leadership to policies. A new leadership\ngroup often brings new policies, and coups are sometimes triggered by\ndisagreements over significant policies. Major policy shifts can instigate\ndissent or grievances from various ruling factions, communities, regions,\nethnicities, or religions.\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders encounter far fewer of these issues, as their\nregimes experience fewer abrupt changes. They face less pressure to dismantle the\nexisting ruling paradigm and establish a new order. Even when adjustments are\nnecessary, they have more time to implement changes gradually.\n\nThese factors contribute to a shorter expected lifespan for coup-entry leaders\ncompared to the relatively longer tenures of autocoup leaders. The average\nsurvival period following an autocoup is approximately five years longer than\nthat of coup-entry leaders (@fig-logrank). Building on these observations, I\npropose the following hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: Political leaders who successfully prolong their tenure in power are\n> more likely to experience extended regime survival compared to coup-entry\n> leaders.***\n\nIn the subsequent section, I will outline the research methodology used in this\npaper. I will introduce several control variables to determine if the hypothesis\nremains persistent and robust.\n\n## Research Design\n\n### Survival analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43361276: China’s Xi allowed to\n    remain ‘president for life’ as term limits removed.
