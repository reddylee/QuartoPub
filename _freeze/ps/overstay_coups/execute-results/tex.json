By distinguishing overstay coups from the broader, more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or autocoups, which encompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research introduces a refined understanding of these specific political events.\n\n  The research involves coding overstay coup events and compiling a comprehensive dataset covering the period from 1945 to the present. Using this dataset, two detailed case studies provide qualitative insights into the dynamics and outcomes of overstay coups. Additionally, a regression analysis identifies the determinants of overstay coup attempts, shedding light on the factors that influence incumbents' decisions to extend their power illegitimately.\n\n  The findings contribute to the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework and empirical evidence on overstay coups. This research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by incumbent leaders, and it examines the implications for democratic resilience, democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, personalization of power, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this study inform policy and theoretical discussions on political stability and the challenges facing contemporary democracies.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nUnderstanding how political leaders come to power and leave office is crucial in\npolitical science. Traditionally, research has focused on two main exit routes:\nleaders who are forced out before their term ends (e.g., coups) or those who\ncomplete their terms and leave voluntarily. However, a growing trend of leaders\nattempting to extend their term limits through illegitimate means has been\nunderstudied. This research examines these power extensions by political leaders,\nor autocoup as defined in this study.\n\nIt is not surprising that coups, as the primary form of irregular exits, have\ngarnered significant academic attention in previous studies. According to\n@goemans2009, out of 374 leaders who exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through\ncoups, accounting for 65.8% of these cases. Frantz and Stein\n([2016](https://reddylee.quarto.pub/ps/autocoups.html#ref-frantz2016)) shows that\ncoup-related exits account for roughly one-third of all exits in autocracies,\nsurpassing any other type, including regular transitions.\n\nIn recent decades, however, once the most common means of leadership change,\ntraditional coups have become less frequent [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. In\ncontrast, autocoups, which are perpetrated by incumbent leaders instead of\nagainst the incumbents, become more prevalence [@ginsburg2010evasion;\n@baturo2014; @versteeg2020law]. While traditional coups are well-documented\n[@thyne2019] due to its significant impact on politics, the equally effects of\nautocoups, if not more important, have received much less research attention\ncompared to coups.\n\nFirstly, autocoups are typically accompanied by a disregard for the rule of law,\nweakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or authoritarian\npersonalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful autocoups increase\nthe risk of irregular power transitions in the future. Research indicates that\nsince 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who successfully overstayed their\nterm limits through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either ousted or\nassassinated while in office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed overstay coups often\ntrigger instability that fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.\n\nDespite its significance in politics, autocoup is understudied compared to coups.\nAlthough several relevant concepts or terminologies such as self-coups,\nautocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay,\nand continuismo have been proposed and discussed [@marsteintredet2019;\n@baturo2022], there is no clear and widely accepted term or terms to describe\nthis type of coups. Sometimes, several different terms are used to describe the\nsame, or at least similar, situations or events, while sometimes the same term is\nused to describe two different situations without clear distinction. For\ninstance, self-coups, autocoups, and autogolpes are normally used to refer to\n\"when a president closes the courts and the legislature, suspends the\nconstitution, and rules by decree until a referendum and new legislative\nelections are held to approve broader executive powers\" [@cameron1998], but power\nextensions are also included in their discussion although they should not be by\ntheir definitions. Moreover, due to the widely accepted concepts, the collection\nof autocoup datasets are in a very premitive stage compared to the rich datasets\nof coups, hence the limited existing studies on autocoups have primarily relied\non case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], with few focusing\non quantitative analyses.\n\nIn order to fully understand irregular political leadership transition and\nsurvival, it is crucial to redefine and clarify the term of autocoup in the first\nplace. Based on the clear definition of the concept and term, we can continue to\nintroduce the autocoup dataset which can be used for further empirical analysis.\n\nThis study aims to address the knowledge gap surrounding autocoups and contribute\nin three areas. First, it clarifies the terminology by defining autocoups\ndependent mainly on power extension. Second, it introduces a new dataset of\nautocoups since 1945 based on this refined definition. Finally, the research\nutilizes this dataset for a quantitative analysis of the factors that influence\nleaders' decisions to attempt autocoups.\n\nThe subsequent section, based on a comprehensive review of the definitions of\npower expansions and power extensions, proposes a precise definition of\nautocoups. This will be followed by an introduction to the new autocoup dataset\nin Part III. In Parts IV and V, I will explain the determinants of autocoup\nattempts through two case studies and demonstrate how the novel autocoup dataset\ncollected in this study can be used in empirical analysis. Finally, I will\nconclude in Part VI, summarizing the key insights gained from the study and\nsuggesting avenues for future research.\n\nUnderstanding how political leaders come to power and leave office is crucial in\npolitical science.
