By distinguishing overstay coups from the broader, more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or autocoups, which encompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research introduces a refined understanding of these specific political events.\n\n  The research involves coding overstay coup events and compiling a comprehensive dataset covering the period from 1945 to the present. Using this dataset, two detailed case studies provide qualitative insights into the dynamics and outcomes of overstay coups. Additionally, a regression analysis identifies the determinants of overstay coup attempts, shedding light on the factors that influence incumbents' decisions to extend their power illegitimately.\n\n  The findings contribute to the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework and empirical evidence on overstay coups. This research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by incumbent leaders, and it examines the implications for democratic resilience, democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, personalization of power, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this study inform policy and theoretical discussions on political stability and the challenges facing contemporary democracies.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe study of irregular power transitions, encompassing both irregular entries and\nexits from office, has long been a central topic in political science. However,\none form of irregular power transition - the incumbent leader's refusal to\nrelinquish power - remains relatively understudied. This scenario, where leaders\noverstay their mandated term limits for one or more terms, or even indefinitely,\nlacks a universally accepted term in the existing literature. To address this\ngap, this study adopts the term \"autocoup\" to denote this phenomenon.\n\nCoups, being the primary form of irregular power transitions, have received\nsignificant scholarly attention. Research by @goemans2009 indicate that coups\naccount for a substantial portion of such transitions, with roughly two-thirds\n(65.8%) of 374 irregular exits occurring through coups. Additionally, @frantz2016\ndemonstrate that coups are the most common form of exit in autocracies,\nsurpassing regular transitions by a third.\n\nHowever, while coups were once frequent, recent decades have witnessed a decline\nin their occurrence [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. Conversely, autocoups appear to be\non the rise, particularly since the Cold War's end [@ginsburg2010evasion;\n@baturo2014; @versteeg2020law]. Despite the significant political impact and\nrising prevalence of autocoups, their study lags behind that of classical coups,\nwhich are extensively documented due to their historical frequency [@thyne2019].\n\nThis research aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the understudied phenomenon\nof autocoups as they are at least equally important and warrant comprehensive\nanalysis. Firstly, autocoups are typically accompanied by a disregard for the\nrule of law, weakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or\nauthoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful\nautocoups increase the risk of future irregular power transitions. Research\nindicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who overstayed\ntheir term limits through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either\nousted or assassinated while in office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed autocoups\noften trigger instability that fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.\n\nDespite their significance, autocoups are understudied compared to traditional\ncoups. Although several relevant concepts and terminologies such as self-coups,\nautocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay,\nand continuismo have been proposed and discussed [@marsteintredet2019;\n@baturo2022], there is no clear and widely accepted term to describe these\nevents. Different terms are often used interchangeably or inconsistently, leading\nto confusion. Moreover, due to the lack of clear concepts, the collection of\nautocoup datasets is still in its early stages compared to the rich datasets of\ntraditional coups. Hence, the limited existing studies on autocoups have\nprimarily relied on case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022],\nwith few focusing on quantitative analyses.\n\nTo fully understand irregular political leadership transitions and survival, we\nneed to redefine and clarify the term \"autocoup\" first. Based on a clear\ndefinition, we can introduce an autocoup dataset that can be used for further\nempirical analysis. This study aims to address these knowledge gap surrounding\nautocoups and contribute in three areas. First, it clarifies the terminology by\ndefining autocoups based mainly on power extension. Second, it introduces a new\ndataset of autocoups since 1945 based on this refined definition. Finally, the\nresearch utilizes this dataset for a quantitative analysis of the factors that\ninfluence leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups.\n\nThe subsequent section, based on a comprehensive review of the definitions of\npower expansions and power extensions, proposes a precise definition of\nautocoups. This will be followed by an introduction to the new autocoup dataset\nin Part III. In Parts IV and V, I will explain the determinants of autocoup\nattempts through two case studies and demonstrate how the novel autocoup dataset\ncollected in this study can be used in empirical analysis. Finally, I will\nconclude in Part VI, summarizing the key insights gained from the study and\nsuggesting avenues for future research.\n\n## Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\n\nCompared to coups, which are clearly defined and widely accepted as illegal\nattempts by elites within the ruling group to overthrow the leadership\n[@powell2011], the concept of autocoups (also known as self-coups or autogolpes)\nsuffers from a lack of consistency and clarity. This ambiguity hinders our\nunderstanding and study of a critical phenomenon in irregular power transitions.\nTo address this gap, we need to tackle two key issues: terminology and\ndefinition.\n\n### Terminology\n\nThe most common term in autocoup literature is self-coup, or autogolpe in Spanish\n[@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017; @marsteintredet2019].\nThis term gained academic prominence after Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori\ndissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree\nin 1992 [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 point out,\nthe term \"self-coup\" can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself,\nwhich is inaccurate since it is not self-directed but targets other state\ninstitutions or apparatus.\n\nAnother approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use terms with\nadjectives or modifiers, such as presidential coup, executive coup,\nconstitutional coup, electoral coup, judicial coup, slow-motion coup, soft coup,\nand parliamentary coup [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms can be helpful in\nspecific contexts, their proliferation often adds to the overall confusion rather\nthan providing clarification. Most of these terms focus on the specific methods\nused by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify the perpetrator,\nnecessitating further explanation. In fact, many of these methods could be\nemployed either by or against executive leaders.\n\nA third alternative involves terms like \"incumbent takeover\" or \"overstay\".\nIncumbent takeover referrs to \"an event perpetuated by a ruling executive that\nsignificantly reduces the formal and/or informal constraints on his/her power\"\n[@baturo2022, p.374], based on earlier research [@svolik2014]. While overstay is\ndefined as \"staying longer than the maximum term as it stood when the candidate\noriginally came in office‚Äù [@ginsburg2011evasion, p.1844]. These terms identify\nthe perpetrator (the incumbent) and/or the nature of the event\n(overstaying/extending power). However, they do not highlight the illegality or\nillegitimacy of these actions. Therefore, they cannot serve as a direct\ncounterpart to \"coup,\" which clearly denotes the illegality of leadership\nousters, while \"takeover\" or \"overstay\" diminish the severity.\n\nTherefore, this study strongly advocates for \"autocoup\" as the most accurate and\nappropriate term. It avoids the pitfalls of other terms by clearly conveying the\nessence of the phenomenon as a coup-like power grab and effectively\ndistinguishing autocoups from classical coups by highlighting the perpetrator.\n\n### Definition\n\nWhile terminology is important, another issue arises with the previous definition\nof autocoups: should we emphasize power expansion or power extension? Power\nExpansion refers to situations where an executive branch expands its power beyond\nits original boundaries, often by encroaching on the authority of other branches\nlike the legislature or judiciary. Power Extension, on the other hand, refers to\nsituations where a leader extends their tenure in office beyond the originally\nmandated term limits. Existing definitions of self-coup or autocoup sometimes\ntouch upon power extensions, but they primarily focus on power expansions, which\nhas several drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align\nwell with the definition of a coup. When we define a classical coup, the focus is\nclearly on the ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or\nrestriction on their power. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition\nof an autocoup should prioritize the extension of executive leadership. We would\nnot classify an event as a coup if a vice president seizes some power from the\npresident, as long as the president remains in office. Similarly, an executive\nleader acquiring more power from other branches should not automatically qualify\nas an autocoup if their term limits remain unchanged.\n\nSecondly, emphasizing power expansion raises issues regarding the purpose of\nlaunching an autocoup. As @cameron1998a defined, a self-coup is \"a temporary\nsuspension of the constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who\nrules by decree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to\nratify a political system with broader executive power\" [@cameron1998a, p.220].\nHowever, without extending their time in office, the leader faces significant\nrisks once their term expires, as they could face legal or political\nrepercussions for the autocoup itself, leaving behind an overly powerful\nexecutive branch for the successor. Although the term \"self-coup\" gained\nprominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which initially involved seizing\npower from other institutions, it is important to note that Fujimori ultimately\nextended his term limits through constitutional amendments. The 1993 Constitution\nallowed Fujimori to run for a second term, which he won with popularity in April\n1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress\npassed a law of \"authentic interpretation\" which effectively allowed him to run\nfor another term in 2000, which he won amid suspicions and rumors. However, he\ndid not survive the third term. In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human\nrights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took refuge in Japan [@ezrow2019].\n\nThirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be\nchallenging. Power expansion might occur as a sudden, significant event, as seen\nwith Fujimori in 1992, or it could be gradual and incremental, as in the case of\nPutin since assuming power in 1999 [@chaisty2019]. In the latter case, it is\nunclear whether each step should be considered an autocoup or if the entire\nprocess together should be labelled as such. If the latter, determining the point\nat which it becomes an autocoup is again problematic.\n\nTherefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should\nprioritize power extension as the core characteristic.\n\nIn light of this discussion, we formally define an autocoup as *the practice of\ncurrent political leaders extending their time in office beyond their originally\nmandated term limits*. Three key points need to be highlighted for this\ndefinition. Firstly, this definition refers to the actual leaders of the country,\nregardless of their official titles. Typically, this would be the president;\nhowever, in some cases, such as in Germany, the primary leader is the premier, as\nthe president is a nominal head of state. Secondly, while the primary\ncharacteristic of an autocoup is extending the term in office, this definition\ndoes not exclude instances of power expansion. Both aspects can coexist, but the\nextension of the term is the central element. Thirdly, autocoups, by their\nnature, subvert legal norms and established power transfer mechanisms. While they\nmay employ seemingly legal tactics, their essence is illegitimacy. This critical\naspect will be explored further in Chapter III.\n\n## Autocoup dataset\n\n### Defining the scope\n\nDefining any concept or term inevitably involves borderline cases that are\ndifficult to categorize. In the context of autocoups, it is particularly\nchallenging to determine whether a specific instance of overstaying should be\ncoded as an autocoup. To avoid ambiguity and dilemmas, we will code all instances\nof incumbents extending their original mandated term in office as autocoups,\nregardless of whether the extension is patently illegal or superficially legal.\n\nThis approach is taken because a truly legitimate amendment to power transition\ninstitutions should only apply to subsequent leaders, not the incumbent. If the\nincumbent changes the rules to their own benefit, the legitimacy of such changes\nis questionable, even if the amendment procedures appear legal. We have valid\nreasons to question their motivations since they are the beneficiaries of these\nreforms.\n\nEven so, some cases remain unclear. For example, consider a two-term limit\npresidency where the leader wins a second term. Allegations of election rigging\nmight surface, raising suspicions about the fairness of the election results. If\nsuch suspicions can be verified with evidence or judicial verdict, the case would\nundoubtedly be coded as an autocoup. However, proving election rigging in\ncountries with powerful executives can be difficult. In such instances, we will\nnot classify it as an autocoup unless a formal judicial verdict confirms the\nrigging.\n\nEven in contexts where leaders lack clear term limits or the constitution allows\nindefinite terms, identifying autocoups remains possible. We will discuss and\nexplain this in the next section.\n\n### **Classifying autocoups** {#sec-classify}\n\nAutocoups can manifest in various forms. To understand this phenomenon better, we\ncan categorize them based on several key factors:\n\n-   **Methods Employed:** This refers to the specific strategies incumbents use\n    to extend their hold on power. Examples include constitution amending or\n    reinterpreting, election cancelling, delaying or rigging.\n\n-   **Degree of Legality:** This dimension captures the extent to which an\n    autocoup deviates from established legal norms. It can range from minor\n    rule-bending to outright constitutional violations.\n\n-   **Duration of Extension:** This category focuses on the length of time the\n    incumbent leader remains in office beyond their designated term limits. It\n    could be a single additional term, multiple terms, or even a lifetime hold on\n    power.\n\n-   **Outcomes:** This factor examines whether the autocoup attempt is successful\n    or ultimately fails.\n\nThis study will primarily focus on the **methods** employed by incumbents to\nstage autocoups. However, we will also code for other relevant aspects like the\ndegree of legality, duration of extension, and outcomes whenever information is\navailable. This multifaceted approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of\nthe variations within autocoups.\n\n#### Evasion of term limits\n\nEvasion of term limits is a common tactic employed in autocoups. Incumbents often\nresort to seemingly legal maneuvers to extend their hold on power. These\nmaneuvers primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means. The incumbents may pressure legislative bodies (congress) or\njudicial institutions (Supreme Court) to reinterpret existing term limits, amend\nthe constitution to extend terms, or even replace the constitution altogether.\nThis might also involve popular vote through referendums, or a combination of\nthese approaches. The extension can range from a single term to indefinite rule.\n\nThese manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means.\n\n-   **Changing Term Length:** Incumbents might lengthen the official term\n    duration (e.g., from 4 to 6 years) to stay in office longer, even if the\n    number of allowed terms remains unchanged. Examples, in the dataset, include\n    Presidents Dacko (CAR, 1962), Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and Pinochet (Chile,\n    1988).\n\n-   **Enabling re-election:** This approach involves incumbents modifying legal\n    or constitutional frameworks to permit themselves to run for leadership\n    again, despite initial restrictions. These restrictions might include\n    prohibitions on re-election, bans on immediate re-election, or term limits\n    that the incumbents have already reached. An illustrative example is\n    President Menem of Argentina in 1993, who leveraged this tactic to extend his\n    tenure.\n\n-   **Removing Term Limits Altogether:** This approach, as seen with President Xi\n    Jinping of China in 2018, technically allows the leader to rule for life,\n    although they may still need to participate in elections (a formality in such\n    cases).\n\n-   **Leader for Life:** This differs from removing term limits as the leader\n    still faces elections (although potentially rigged or uncontested). An\n    example is Indonesia's President Sukarno, who attempted to declare himself\n    president for life in 1963 (ultimately unsuccessful).\n\nThese methods are often used in combination. Initially, the duration of a term is\nextended, followed by amendments to allow re-election, then the removal of term\nlimits, and finally, the declaration of the leader for life. For example, Haitian\nPresident Fran√ßois Duvalier amended the constitution in 1961 to permit immediate\nre-election and then declared himself president for life in 1964.\n\n#### Election Manipulation or Rigging\n\nElection manipulation or rigging is the second most commonly used tactic to\nextend an incumbent's tenure.\n\n-   **Delaying or Removing Elections:** Delaying or removing scheduled elections\n    without legitimate justification is a frequent method used by incumbents to\n    maintain power. For instance, Chadian President Fran√ßois Tombalbaye delayed\n    general elections until 1969 after assuming power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan\n    President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos suspended elections throughout his rule\n    from 1979 to 2017.\n\n-   **Refusing Unfavourable Election Results:** Incumbents may refuse to accept\n    unfavourable election results and attempt to overturn them through\n    illegitimate means. For example, President Donald Trump of the United States\n    refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and tried to overturn\n    them.\n\n-   **Rigging Elections:** Winning elections with an extraordinarily high\n    percentage of votes is highly questionable. This study will code elections\n    where the incumbent wins more than 90% of the vote as autocoups. For\n    instance, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently won\n    elections with over 95% of the vote in multi-party elections since 1996,\n    indicating election rigging.\n\n-   **Excluding Opposition in Elections:** Manipulating the electoral process by\n    excluding opposition parties or candidates from participation, effectively\n    creating a one-candidate race, clearly signifies an autocoup.\n\n#### **Figurehead**\n\nTo circumvent term limits, some incumbents might choose a close associate to act\nas a figurehead, taking the office publicly while the incumbent retains real\npower behind the scenes. This can be achieved through seemingly subordinate\npositions.\n\nOne example is Russia in 2008. Facing term limits, President Putin selected\nDmitry Medvedev to run for president. After the election, Medvedev appointed\nPutin as Prime Minister. However, most analysts believe Putin wielded the true\npower throughout this period.\n\n#### **Constitutional power transferring**\n\nThis tactic involves an incumbent leader manipulating the constitution or legal\nframework to create a new position of power, or elevate an existing one, before\nstepping down from their current role. They then strategically take on this new\nposition, effectively retaining significant control despite appearing to\nrelinquish power. For example, in 2017, Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, the Prime Minister\nof Turkey, spearheaded a constitutional referendum that transitioned the country\nfrom a parliamentary system to a presidential one. This new system concentrated\nsignificant executive power in the presidency. Following the referendum's\napproval, Erdoƒüan successfully ran for the newly established presidency,\neffectively retaining control under a different title.\n\n#### One-Time Arrangement for Current Leaders\n\nThis strategy involves special arrangements that extend the term or tenure of\ncurrent leaders without altering the underlying institutions. For example,\nLebanon extended President √âmile Lahoud's term by three years in 2004 through a\none-time arrangement.\n\n### Data Coding\n\n#### Data sources\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-source .cell tbl-cap='Sources of coding autocoup dataset'}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{60pt}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{60pt}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{60pt}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{60pt}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{150pt}}\n\\toprule\nSource & Years & Unit of Research & Obervations & Authors \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Archigos}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{1875-2015}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Leaders}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{3409}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{ Hein Goemans, Kristian Skrede Gleditsch, Giacomo Chiozza}}} \\\\ \nREIGN & 1921-2021 & Leaders & 2544 & Curtis Bell, Clayton Besaw, Matthew Frank \\\\ \n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Incumbent Takeover}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{1913-2019}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Incumbent takeovers}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{279}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Alexander Baturo, Jakob Tolstrup}}} \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n:::\n\n\n\nThe autocoup dataset, like most dataset coding procedures, is based on existing\nstudies and datasets. @tbl-source outlines the main sources for coding the\nautocoup dataset. The Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the REIGN dataset\n[@bell2016reign] provide comprehensive data on all leaders from 1875 to 2021,\nalthough our coding only includes autocoups since 1945. These datasets help\nidentify the actual rulers of countries, saving time in distinguishing real\nleaders from nominal heads of state.\n\nThe Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022], which integrates data from 11\nrelated datasets, offers a broad spectrum of cases where leaders significantly\nreduce the constraints on their power, encompassing both power expansions and\nextensions. Since some executive takeovers do not qualify as autocoups due to the\nlack of term extensions, I cross-referenced the Archigos dataset, which includes\ndetailed trajectories of leaders' entries and exits from power, to verify the\nqualifications for autocoups.\n\nAs the Archigos dataset concludes at the end of 2015, I used trusted news reports\nto validate data from the Incumbent Takeover dataset. In total, I coded 113\nobservations, with 75 overlapping with the candidate data from Incumbent\nTakeover. The remaining 38 events were newly coded by the author through\nverification with other sources such as Archigos, REIGN, and news reports.The\nmain deviation from the Incumbent Takeover dataset arises from excluding power\nexpansions that do not involve attempts to extend tenure.\n\n#### Definitions of main variables\n\nThis section describes the variables included in the autocoup dataset.\n\n-   **Country Identification:**\n\n    -   `ccode` and `country`: These variables come from the Correlates of War\n        project [@stinnett2002] and identify the countries included in the\n        dataset, which are widely used in political science datasets, ensuring\n        consistency and compatibility across different studies and datasets.\n\n-   **Leader Information:**\n\n    -   `leader_name`: This variable follows the Archigos dataset's coding and\n        records the name of the de facto leader who wielded power in the country.\n\n-   **Timeline Variables:**\n\n    -   `entry_date`: Captures the date the leader assumed power.\n\n    -   `exit_date`: Records the date the leader left office.\n\n    -   `autocoup_date`: Indicates the date the autocoup is considered to have\n        occurred. Since extensions often happen incrementally, this date reflects\n        a significant event marking the extension, such as a legislative vote or\n        successful referendum.\n\n    -   `extending_date`: Represents the start date of the leader's additional\n        term acquired through the autocoup.\n\n    The `entry_date` and `exit_date` come from the Archigos and REIGN datasets,\n    while the other two dates are coded by the dataset creator.\n\n-   **Power Transition Methods:**\n\n    -   `entry_method` and `exit_method`: These categorical variables record how\n        the leader entered and exited power (e.g., election, coup d'√©tat, death).\n\n    -   `entry_regular` and `exit_regular`: These dummy variables indicate\n        whether the entry and exit methods were regular (e.g., election) or\n        irregular (e.g., coup).\n\n-   **Autocoup Details:**\n\n    -   `autocoup_method`: This key variable captures the various methods leaders\n        use to extend their stay in power (see @sec-classify for details).\n\n    -   `autocoup_outcome`: This variable indicates the outcome of the autocoup\n        attempt: \"fail and lose power\", \"fail but complete original tenure\", or\n        \"successful\". For successful coups, the additional term length can be\n        calculated from the difference between `exit_date` and `extending_date`.\n\n-   **Data Source:**\n\n    -   `source`: This variable identifies the dataset source used for coding,\n        primarily differentiating among \"Incumbent Takeovers\" or other sources.\n\n-   **Additional Notes:**\n\n    -   `notes`: This variable provides context for exceptional cases. For\n        instance, if a leader undertook multiple autocoup attempts, details are\n        recorded here.\n\nThe dataset encompasses a total of 14 variables along with the `notes` field.\n\n### Data descriptions\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-autocoup_method .cell tbl-cap='Autocoup methods and success rates (1945-2021)'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{135pt}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{105pt}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{105pt}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{75pt}}\n\\toprule\nAutocoup Method & Autocoup Attempted & Autocoup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nEnabling re-election & 49 & 34 & 69.4\\% \\\\ \nRemoving term limits & 14 & 14 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nDelaying elections & 9 & 9 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nLeader for life & 9 & 9 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nChanging term length & 7 & 5 & 71.4\\% \\\\ \nFigurehead & 6 & 5 & 83.3\\% \\\\ \nOne-time arrangement & 5 & 4 & 80.0\\% \\\\ \nRefusing election results & 4 & 1 & 25.0\\% \\\\ \nReassigning power role & 4 & 2 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nRigging elections & 3 & 2 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nCancelling elections & 3 & 3 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 113 & 88 & 77.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAccording to our primary coding, we have identified 113 autocoup cases from 1945\nto 2021, involving 74 countries. As shown in @tbl-autocoup_method,\nthe most common autocoup method is enabling re-election, accounting for 49\nevents. This is followed by removing term limits altogether, with 14 cases, and\nthen delaying elections and declaring the leader for life, each with 9 cases.\n\nExamining the success rates of autocoups, the total success rate is 78%, which is\nsignificantly higher than the roughly 50% success rate of classical coups. This\nsuggests that incumbents are in an advantageous position to expand or extend\ntheir powers as executive leaders. They can do so openly and gradually, whereas\ncoup plotters must operate in secrecy and face numerous challenges such as\npromissory issues and the risk of betrayal or exposure.\n\nHowever, the success rates vary significantly across different methods. Removing\nterm limits, delaying elections, declaring the leader for life, and canceling\nelections are all 100% successful. In contrast, there are only 4 cases of\nrefusing election results, with just one succeeding. Although this sample is\nsmall, it suggests that in regimes where general elections are held and\nincumbents lose, the system is relatively more democratic. In such cases,\nincumbents must run for office without the ability to rig elections, making it\nless likely for them to overturn election results.\n\n## Determinants of Autocoup Attempts: Case Studies\n\n### High attempts and high success rate of autocoups in post-communist countries\n\nFrom the dataset, we observe that in post-communist countries, both the frequency\nand success rate of autocoups are notably high. Post-communist countries refer to\nthose that were communist at the end of the Cold War, regardless of whether they\nhave since transitioned to other types of regimes. In these countries, there are\n12 documented cases[^1] of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency, with only 2\nof these attempts failing. Look into the cases in post-communist countries, we\ncan see several characteristics in these countries. First of all, although most\nof these countries transferred from communist regimes to non-communist countries\n(except China), they inherit the authoritarian system of communist. Secondly, the\ntransitions did not result in the removal or overthrow of the previous ruling\ngroups and the former communist elites completely remain in power. Thirdly,\nalthough most of the countries introduced general elections and term limits, due\nto the inertia of former communist regimes, the term limits are often broken and\nthe elections are rigged.\n\nFor example, Lukashenko was the member Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Soviet\nSocialist Republic before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After the\ndissolution, he assumed the position of head of the interim anti-corruption\ncommittee of the Supreme Council of Belarus. He was elected as the first\npresident of Belarus in 1994, then holding the office ever since. The same\npattern happens to all the five Central Asian countries of the former Soviet\nUnion. In the 1994 constitutions, the presidency has a maxium of two successive\nterms, but this was removed by Lukashenko in 2004. Further more, International\nmonitors have not regarded Belarusian elections as free and fair, except for his\ninitial win. Although a lot of protests against Lukashenko, he claimed to win\nwith a pretty high votes, almost more than 80% in each election. The\npost-dissolution leaders of these countries are all high officials or heads of\nthe former Soviet republics and continued their leadership in presidency.\n\n## Determinants of Autocoup Attempts: Case Studies\n\n### High Frequency and Success Rate of Autocoups in Post-Communist Countries\n\nFrom the dataset, we observe that in post-communist countries, both the frequency\nand success rate of autocoups are notably high. Post-communist countries refer to\nthose that were communist at the end of the Cold War, regardless of whether they\nhave since transitioned to other types of regimes. In these countries, there are\n12 documented cases[^2] of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency, with only 2\nof these attempts failing.\n\nExamining the cases in post-communist countries, several characteristics stand\nout:\n\n-   **Inherited Authoritarian Systems**: Although most of these countries\n    transitioned from communist regimes to non-communist governments (with the\n    exception of China), they inherited the authoritarian systems of their\n    communist past.\n-   **Continuity of Former Elites**: The transitions did not result in the\n    removal or overthrow of the previous ruling groups. Instead, the former\n    communist elites remained in power.\n-   **Subverted Democratic Processes**: Despite the introduction of general\n    elections and term limits in most of these countries, the legacy of the\n    former communist regimes often led to term limits being ignored and elections\n    being rigged.\n\nFor example, Alexander Lukashenko was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the\nByelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic before the dissolution of the Soviet\nUnion. After the dissolution, he became head of the interim anti-corruption\ncommittee of the Supreme Council of Belarus. Elected as the first president of\nBelarus in 1994, he has held the office ever since. Initially, the 1994\nconstitutions set a maximum of two successive presidential terms, but Lukashenko\nremoved this limit in 2004. Furthermore, international monitors have not regarded\nBelarusian elections as free and fair, except for his initial win. Despite\nsignificant protests against him, Lukashenko claimed to win with a high vote\nshare, often exceeding 80% in each election. This pattern is evident in all five\nCentral Asian countries of the former Soviet Union. Similarly, the\npost-dissolution leaders of these countries were high officials or heads of the\nformer Soviet republics who continued their leadership in the presidency.\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n[^1]: The 12 cases involve 11 countries, with Azerbaijan experiencing two\n    autocoup attempts.\n\n[^2]: The 12 cases involve 11 countries, with Azerbaijan experiencing two\n    autocoup attempts.\n",
