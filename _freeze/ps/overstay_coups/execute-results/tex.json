By distinguishing overstay coups from the broader, more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or autocoups, which encompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research introduces a refined understanding of these specific political events.\n\n  The research involves coding overstay coup events and compiling a comprehensive dataset covering the period from 1945 to the present. Using this dataset, two detailed case studies provide qualitative insights into the dynamics and outcomes of overstay coups. Additionally, a regression analysis identifies the determinants of overstay coup attempts, shedding light on the factors that influence incumbents' decisions to extend their power illegitimately.\n\n  The findings contribute to the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework and empirical evidence on overstay coups. This research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by incumbent leaders, and it examines the implications for democratic resilience, democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, personalization of power, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this study inform policy and theoretical discussions on political stability and the challenges facing contemporary democracies.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nUnderstanding how political leaders come to power and leave office is crucial in\npolitical science. Traditionally, research has focused on two main exit routes:\nleaders who are forced out before their term ends (e.g., coups) or those who\ncomplete their terms and leave voluntarily. However, a growing trend of leaders\nattempting to extend their term limits through illegitimate means has been\nunderstudied. This research examines these irregular stays in power, specifically\nfocusing on the concept of overstay coups, as defined in this study.\n\nCoups, once a common means of leadership change, have become less frequent in\nrecent decades [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. In contrast, irregular stays in\npower—often referred to by various terms like self-coups, autocoups/autogolpes,\nincumbent takeovers, or continuismo—are on the rise [@ginsburg2010; @baturo2014;\n@versteeg2020]. Leaders like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping exemplify this trend,\nmanipulating legal frameworks to extend their rule. This phenomenon is not\nlimited to non-democratic regimes; even well-established democracies have\nwitnessed similar attempts [@antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022].\n\nOverstay coups pose a significant threat to democratic stability and the trend of\ndemocratization in autocratic countries. While the negative impacts of coups are\nwell-documented [@thyne2019], the detrimental effects of overstay coups are no\nless severe. Firstly, overstay coups are typically accompanied by a disregard for\nthe rule of law, weakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or\nauthoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful\noverstay coups increase the risk of irregular power transitions in the future.\nResearch indicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who\noverstayed in non-democratic countries were either ousted or assassinated while\nin office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed overstay coups often trigger instability\nthat fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.\n\nDespite their prevalence and negative consequences, overstay coups have received\nsignificantly less research attention compared to coups. Furthermore, there are\ntwo issues in previous studies that need to be addressed or clarified. Firstly,\nas irregular events or actions perpetrated by incumbent leaders become more\ncommon post-Cold War, several relevant concepts or terminologies such as\nself-coups, autocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement,\noverstay, and continuismo have become rich and popular topics of discussion\n[@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. However, there is no clear and widely\naccepted term or terms to describe these political situations or events.\nAdditionally, these terms are used by different scholars in a puzzling context.\nSometimes, several different terms are used to describe the same, or at least\nsimilar, situations or events. For example, coups, autocoups, autogolpes, and\nexecutive aggrandizement are used to describe power expansions by executive\nleaders in different literatures, while overstay and continuismo are used to\ndescribe power extensions by incumbent leaders. Sometimes the same term is used\nto describe two different situations without clear distinction. For instance,\nself-coups, autocoups, and autogolpes are normally used to refer to \"when a\npresident closes the courts and the legislature, suspends the constitution, and\nrules by decree until a referendum and new legislative elections are held to\napprove broader executive powers\" [@cameron1998], but power extensions are also\nincluded in their discussion although they should not be by their definitions.\nSecondly, due to the lack of datasets compared to the rich datasets of coups, the\nlimited existing studies on irregular overstays have primarily relied on case\nstudies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], with few focusing on\nquantitative analyses.\n\nIn order to fully understand irregular political leadership transition and\nsurvival, it is crucial to clarify these terms in the first place, distinguish\npower expansion and power extension, and then introduce a relevant dataset for\nfurther empirical analysis.\n\nThis study aims to address the knowledge gap surrounding overstay coups and\ncontribute in three areas. First, it clarifies the terminology by defining\noverstay coups as a specific type of irregular stay characterized by power\nextension. Second, it introduces a new dataset of overstay coups since 1945 based\non this refined definition. Finally, the research utilizes this dataset for a\nquantitative analysis of the factors that influence leaders' decisions to attempt\noverstay coups.\n\nThe subsequent section, based on a comprehensive review of the definitions of\npower expansions and power extensions, proposes a precise definition of overstay\ncoups. This will be followed by an introduction to the dataset of overstay coups.\nIn Parts IV and V, I will explain the determinants of overstay coup attempts\nthrough two case studies and demonstrate how the novel overstay coup dataset\ncollected in this study can be used in empirical analysis. Finally, I will\nconclude in Part VI, summarizing the key insights gained from the study and\nsuggesting avenues for future research.\n\n## Overstay coup: Relevant terms and a new definition\n\n### Relevant terms on power expansions and power extensions\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n",
