By distinguishing overstay coups from the broader, more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or autocoups, which encompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research introduces a refined understanding of these specific political events.\n\n  The research involves coding overstay coup events and compiling a comprehensive dataset covering the period from 1945 to the present. Using this dataset, two detailed case studies provide qualitative insights into the dynamics and outcomes of overstay coups. Additionally, a regression analysis identifies the determinants of overstay coup attempts, shedding light on the factors that influence incumbents' decisions to extend their power illegitimately.\n\n  The findings contribute to the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework and empirical evidence on overstay coups. This research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by incumbent leaders, and it examines the implications for democratic resilience, democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, personalization of power, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this study inform policy and theoretical discussions on political stability and the challenges facing contemporary democracies.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe study of irregular power transitions, encompassing both irregular entries and\nexits from office, has long been a central topic in political science. However,\none form of irregular power transition - the incumbent leader's refusal to\nrelinquish power - remains relatively understudied. This scenario, where leaders\noverstay their mandated term limits for one or more terms, or even indefinitely,\nlacks a universally accepted term in the existing literature. To address this\ngap, this study adopts the term \"autocoup\" to denote this phenomenon.\n\nCoups, being the primary form of irregular power transitions, have received\nsignificant scholarly attention. Research by @goemans2009 indicate that coups\naccount for a substantial portion of such transitions, with roughly two-thirds\n(65.8%) of 374 irregular exits occurring through coups. Additionally, @frantz2016\ndemonstrate that coups are the most common form of exit in autocracies,\nsurpassing regular transitions by a third.\n\nHowever, while coups were once frequent, recent decades have witnessed a decline\nin their occurrence [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. Conversely, autocoups appear to be\non the rise, particularly since the Cold War's end [@ginsburg2010evasion;\n@baturo2014; @versteeg2020law]. Despite the significant political impact and\nrising prevalence of autocoups, their study lags behind that of classical coups,\nwhich are extensively documented due to their historical frequency [@thyne2019].\n\nThis research aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the understudied phenomenon\nof autocoups as they are at least equally important and warrant comprehensive\nanalysis. Firstly, autocoups are typically accompanied by a disregard for the\nrule of law, weakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or\nauthoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful\nautocoups increase the risk of future irregular power transitions. Research\nindicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who overstayed\ntheir term limits through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either\nousted or assassinated while in office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed autocoups\noften trigger instability that fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.\n\nDespite their significance, autocoups are understudied compared to traditional\ncoups. Although several relevant concepts and terminologies such as self-coups,\nautocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay,\nand continuismo have been proposed and discussed [@marsteintredet2019;\n@baturo2022], there is no clear and widely accepted term to describe these\nevents. Different terms are often used interchangeably or inconsistently, leading\nto confusion. Moreover, due to the lack of clear concepts, the collection of\nautocoup datasets is still in its early stages compared to the rich datasets of\ntraditional coups. Hence, the limited existing studies on autocoups have\nprimarily relied on case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022],\nwith few focusing on quantitative analyses.\n\nTo fully understand irregular political leadership transitions and survival, we\nneed to redefine and clarify the term \"autocoup\" first. Based on a clear\ndefinition, we can introduce an autocoup dataset that can be used for further\nempirical analysis. This study aims to address these knowledge gap surrounding\nautocoups and contribute in three areas. First, it clarifies the terminology by\ndefining autocoups based mainly on power extension. Second, it introduces a new\ndataset of autocoups since 1945 based on this refined definition. Finally, the\nresearch utilizes this dataset for a quantitative analysis of the factors that\ninfluence leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups.\n\nThe subsequent section, based on a comprehensive review of the definitions of\npower expansions and power extensions, proposes a precise definition of\nautocoups. This will be followed by an introduction to the new autocoup dataset\nin Part III. In Parts IV and V, I will explain the determinants of autocoup\nattempts through two case studies and demonstrate how the novel autocoup dataset\ncollected in this study can be used in empirical analysis. Finally, I will\nconclude in Part VI, summarizing the key insights gained from the study and\nsuggesting avenues for future research.\n\n## Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\n\nCompared to coups, which are clearly defined and widely accepted as illegal\nattempts by elites within the ruling group to overthrow the leadership\n[@powell2011], the concept of autocoups (also known as self-coups or autogolpes)\nsuffers from a lack of consistency and clarity. This ambiguity hinders our\nunderstanding and study of a critical phenomenon in irregular power transitions.\nTo address this gap, we need to tackle two key issues: terminology and\ndefinition.\n\n### Terminology\n\nThe most common term in autocoup literature is self-coup, or autogolpe in Spanish\n[@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017; @marsteintredet2019].\nThis term gained academic prominence after Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori\ndissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree\nin 1992 [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 point out,\nthe term \"self-coup\" can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself,\nwhich is inaccurate since it is not self-directed but targets other state\ninstitutions or apparatus.\n\nAnother approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use terms with\nadjectives or modifiers, such as presidential coup, executive coup,\nconstitutional coup, electoral coup, judicial coup, slow-motion coup, soft coup,\nand parliamentary coup [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms can be helpful in\nspecific contexts, their proliferation often adds to the overall confusion rather\nthan providing clarification. Most of these terms focus on the specific methods\nused by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify the perpetrator,\nnecessitating further explanation. In fact, many of these methods could be\nemployed either by or against executive leaders.\n\nA third alternative involves terms like \"incumbent takeover\" or \"executive\ntakeover,\" referring to \"an event perpetuated by a ruling executive that\nsignificantly reduces the formal and/or informal constraints on his/her power\"\n[@baturo2022, p.374], based on earlier research [@svolik2014]. These terms\nidentify the perpetrator (the incumbent) and the nature of the event (a power\ngrab). However, \"incumbent takeover\" does not highlight the illegality or\nillegitimacy of these actions. Therefore, it cannot serve as a direct counterpart\nto \"coup,\" which clearly denotes the illegality of leadership ousters, while\n\"takeover\" diminishes the severity.\n\nTherefore, this study strongly advocates for \"autocoup\" as the most accurate and\nappropriate term. It avoids the pitfalls of other terms by clearly conveying the\nessence of the phenomenon as a coup-like power grab and effectively\ndistinguishing autocoups from classical coups by highlighting the perpetrator.\n\n### Definition\n\nWhile terminology is important, another issue arises with the previous definition\nof autocoups: should we emphasize power expansion or power extension? Power\nExpansion refers to situations where an executive branch expands its power beyond\nits original boundaries, often by encroaching on the authority of other branches\nlike the legislature or judiciary. Power Extension, on the other hand, refers to\nsituations where a leader extends their tenure in office beyond the originally\nmandated term limits. Existing definitions of self-coup or autocoup sometimes\ntouch upon power extensions, but they primarily focus on power expansions, which\nhas several drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align\nwell with the definition of a coup. When we define a classical coup, the focus is\nclearly on the ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or\nrestriction on their power. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition\nof an autocoup should prioritize the extension of executive leadership. We would\nnot classify an event as a coup if a vice president seizes some power from the\npresident, as long as the president remains in office. Similarly, an executive\nleader acquiring more power from other branches should not automatically qualify\nas an autocoup if their term limits remain unchanged.\n\nSecondly, emphasizing power expansion raises issues regarding the purpose of\nlaunching an autocoup. As @cameron1998a defined, a self-coup is \"a temporary\nsuspension of the constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who\nrules by decree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to\nratify a political system with broader executive power\" [@cameron1998a, p.220].\nHowever, without extending their time in office, the leader faces significant\nrisks once their term expires, as they could face legal or political\nrepercussions for the autocoup itself, leaving behind an overly powerful\nexecutive branch for the successor. Although the term \"self-coup\" gained\nprominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which initially involved seizing\npower from other institutions, it is important to note that Fujimori ultimately\nextended his term limits through constitutional amendments. The 1993 Constitution\nallowed Fujimori to run for a second term, which he won with popularity in April\n1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress\npassed a law of \"authentic interpretation\" which effectively allowed him to run\nfor another term in 2000, which he won amid suspicions and rumors. However, he\ndid not survive the third term. In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human\nrights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took refuge in Japan [@ezrow2019].\n\nThirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be\nchallenging. Power expansion might occur as a sudden, significant event, as seen\nwith Fujimori in 1992, or it could be gradual and incremental, as in the case of\nPutin since assuming power in 1999 [@chaisty2019]. In the latter case, it is\nunclear whether each step should be considered an autocoup or if the entire\nprocess together should be labelled as such. If the latter, determining the point\nat which it becomes an autocoup is again problematic.\n\nTherefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should\nprioritize power extension as the core characteristic.\n\nIn light of this discussion, we formally define an autocoup as *the practice of\ncurrent political leaders extending their time in office beyond their originally\nmandated term limits*. Two key points need to be highlighted. Firstly, this\ndefinition does not exclude power expansion, but its primary characteristic is\nextending the term in office. Secondly, the essence of an autocoup is\nillegitimate, although it often employs seemingly legal mechanisms, which will be\ndiscussed in more detail in Chapter III.\n\n\n\n",
