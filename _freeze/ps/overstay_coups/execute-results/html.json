By distinguishing overstay coups from the broader, more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or autocoups, which encompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research introduces a refined understanding of these specific political events.\n\n  The research involves coding overstay coup events and compiling a comprehensive dataset covering the period from 1945 to the present. Using this dataset, two detailed case studies provide qualitative insights into the dynamics and outcomes of overstay coups. Additionally, a regression analysis identifies the determinants of overstay coup attempts, shedding light on the factors that influence incumbents' decisions to extend their power illegitimately.\n\n  The findings contribute to the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework and empirical evidence on overstay coups. This research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by incumbent leaders, and it examines the implications for democratic resilience, democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, personalization of power, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this study inform policy and theoretical discussions on political stability and the challenges facing contemporary democracies.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe study of irregular power transitions, encompassing both irregular entries and\nexits from office, has long been a central topic in political science. However,\none form of irregular power transition - the incumbent leader's refusal to\nrelinquish power - remains relatively understudied. This scenario, where leaders\noverstay their mandated term limits for one or more terms, or even indefinitely,\nlacks a universally accepted term in the existing literature. To address this\ngap, this study adopts the term \"autocoup\" to denote this phenomenon.\n\nCoups, being the primary form of irregular power transitions, have received\nsignificant scholarly attention. Research by @goemans2009 indicate that coups\naccount for a substantial portion of such transitions, with roughly two-thirds\n(65.8%) of 374 irregular exits occurring through coups. Additionally, @frantz2016\ndemonstrate that coups are the most common form of exit in autocracies,\nsurpassing regular transitions by a third.\n\nHowever, while coups were once frequent, recent decades have witnessed a decline\nin their occurrence [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. Conversely, autocoups appear to be\non the rise, particularly since the Cold War's end [@ginsburg2010evasion;\n@baturo2014; @versteeg2020law]. Despite the significant political impact and\nrising prevalence of autocoups, their study lags behind that of classical coups,\nwhich are extensively documented due to their historical frequency [@thyne2019].\n\nThis research aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the understudied phenomenon\nof autocoups as they are at least equally important and warrant comprehensive\nanalysis. Firstly, autocoups are typically accompanied by a disregard for the\nrule of law, weakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or\nauthoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful\nautocoups increase the risk of future irregular power transitions. Research\nindicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who overstayed\ntheir term limits through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either\nousted or assassinated while in office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed autocoups\noften trigger instability that fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.\n\nDespite their significance, autocoups are understudied compared to traditional\ncoups. Although several relevant concepts and terminologies such as self-coups,\nautocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay,\nand continuismo have been proposed and discussed [@marsteintredet2019;\n@baturo2022], there is no clear and widely accepted term to describe these\nevents. Different terms are often used interchangeably or inconsistently, leading\nto confusion. Moreover, due to the lack of clear concepts, the collection of\nautocoup datasets is still in its early stages compared to the rich datasets of\ntraditional coups. Hence, the limited existing studies on autocoups have\nprimarily relied on case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022],\nwith few focusing on quantitative analyses.\n\nTo fully understand irregular political leadership transitions and survival, we\nneed to redefine and clarify the term \"autocoup\" first. Based on a clear\ndefinition, we can introduce an autocoup dataset that can be used for further\nempirical analysis. This study aims to address these knowledge gap surrounding\nautocoups and contribute in three areas. First, it clarifies the terminology by\ndefining autocoups based mainly on power extension. Second, it introduces a new\ndataset of autocoups since 1945 based on this refined definition. Finally, the\nresearch utilizes this dataset for a quantitative analysis of the factors that\ninfluence leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups.\n\nThe subsequent section, based on a comprehensive review of the definitions of\npower expansions and power extensions, proposes a precise definition of\nautocoups. This will be followed by an introduction to the new autocoup dataset\nin Part III. In Parts IV and V, I will explain the determinants of autocoup\nattempts through two case studies and demonstrate how the novel autocoup dataset\ncollected in this study can be used in empirical analysis. Finally, I will\nconclude in Part VI, summarizing the key insights gained from the study and\nsuggesting avenues for future research.\n\n## Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\n\nCompared to coups, which are clearly defined and widely accepted as illegal\nattempts by elites within the ruling group to overthrow the leadership\n[@powell2011], the concept of autocoups (also known as autogolpes and self-coups)\nsuffers from a lack of consistency and clarity. This ambiguity hinders our\nunderstanding and studying of a critical phenomenon in irregular power\ntransitions, hence necessitates addressing two key issues: terminology and core\ncharacteristics.\n\n### Choosing the Right Term\n\nThe most common terms in autocoup literature are *self-coup* or *autogolpe* in\nSpanish [@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017;\n@marsteintredet2019]. The usage gained academic prominence after Peruvian\nPresident Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the\nconstitution, and ruled by decree in 1992 [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998]. It is\ncommonly defined as \"a temporary suspension of the constitution and dissolution\nof congress by the executive, who rules by decree until new legislative elections\nand a referendum can be held to ratify a political system with broader executive\npower\" [@cameron1998a, p.220]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 point out, the\nterm \"self-coup\" can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself, which\nis inaccurate since it is not self-directed but to other state institutions or\napparatus.\n\nAnother approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use coups with\nadjectives or modifiers, such as presidential coup, executive coup,\nconstitutional coup, electoral coup, judicial coup, slow-motion coup, soft coup,\nand parliamentary coup [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms can be helpful in\nspecific power expansions or power grabs perpetrated by incumbents, the\nproliferation of such terms can add to the overall confusion rather than\nproviding clarification. Essentially, most of these coups with adjective terms\nprimarily focus on the specific methods used by incumbents to expand their power\nor lessen restrictions, often failing to clearly identify the incumbent leader as\nthe perpetrator. Even in specific contexts, using a term like \"constitutional\nautocoup\" instead of \"constitutional coup\" would be more informative due to its\nexplicit identification of the incumbent as the actor.\n\nThe third alternative involves terms like like \"incumbent takeover\" or \"executive\ntakeover,\" referring to \"an event perpetuated by a ruling executive that\nsignificantly reduces the formal and/or informal constraints on his/her power\"\n[@baturo2022, p.374] based on earlier research [@svolik2014]. This term\nidentifies the perpetrator (incumbent) and the nature of the event (power grab).\nHowever, \"incumbent takeover\" lacks clarity regarding the illegal or illegitimate\nnature of these actions. While \"coup\" clearly denotes the illegality of\nleadership ousters, replacing it with \"takeover\" diminishes the severity.\nTherefore, \"incumbent takeover\" cannot be a direct counterpart to \"coup\" due to\nits ambiguity concerning illegality.\n\nBased on this analysis, \"autocoup\" emerges as the most accurate and appropriate\nterm to describe situations where incumbents orchestrate actions to extend and/or\nexpand their power through illegitimate means.\n\n### Key characteristics of autocoups\n\nBeyond terminology, a clear definition of an autocoup is crucial. It is important\nto distinguish autocoups from other power grabs.\n\nAnother issue with the previous definition of *self-coup* is its emphasis on\nexecutive aggrandizement or power expansion rather than power extension. It\nprimarily describes situations where executive leaders seize more power from\nother branches of government. While power extensions might be included in some\nanalyses as well, they are not taken as the determinant feature of self-coups.\nWhen we refer to a classical coup, we clearly mean the ouster of the sitting\nexecutive leader instead of the power shrinking from the executive leader, or the\nouster of any other leader. Due to the same logic, it is more appropriate to\ndefine autocoup based first on the executive leadership instead of other state\napparatus, second on the holding or relinquishing the leadership instead of power\nexpansions of the executive role.\n\nthe power extension instead of power expansion. For instance, we would not code a\nsituation, say a vice-president, a primer, or a chair of the congress grabbing\nmore power from the president, a coup, as long as the president is still in the\noffice. Then, we should not code the power grabs by the president from a\nvice-president, a primer, or a chair of the congress as a autocoup.\n\nI argue that power extension should be the main feature of autocoups.\n\nReturning to the core definition of a classic coup, which focuses on the illegal\nreplacement of incumbent leaders, offers greater clarity.\n\nWhile coups aim to replace incumbents, autocoups aim to prevent legal successors\nfrom assuming power. Coups are overt illegal actions, whereas autocoups might\nhave a veneer of legality achieved through the manipulation of state institutions\nand officials.\n\nIn light of this discussion, we formally define an autocoup as the practice of\ncurrent political leaders extending their time in office beyond their originally\nmandated term limits, often achieved through seemingly legal means like\nconstitutional amendments or referendums, but ultimately illegitimate in essence.\n\n-   **Focus on Power Extension:** While autocoups might involve power expansion\n    (taking more power from other branches), their primary characteristic is\n    extending the incumbent's term in office.\n\n-   **Illegality or Illegitimacy:** Autocoups often employ seemingly legal\n    mechanisms like referendums or constitutional amendments, but their essence\n    is illegitimate.\n\nThis review highlights the need for a clear understanding of autocoups. By\nadvocating for the term \"autocoup\" and establishing its core characteristics, we\ncan improve research and analysis of this critical phenomenon in irregular power\ntransitions.\n\nThis definition, or slight variations of it, Some relevant terms with similar\ndefinition, such as \"presidential coup\" [@roberts1995; @marshall2019coup],\n\"executive coup\" [@bermeo2016], and \"constitutional coup\" [@helmke2017], have\nalso been used.\n\n\n\n",
