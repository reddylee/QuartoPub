Notably,\nthe beginning of the “third wave” of democratization\n[@huntington1991democratization] saw significant transitions to democracy in the\nlast two decades of the 20th century. Since the end of the Cold War in the early\n1990s, as illustrated in @fig-democracy, democratic countries have outnumbered\nnon-democratic ones, with the gap widening ever since.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of the number of democratic and non-democratic countries (1945-2020)](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-docx/fig-democracy-1.png){#fig-democracy fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nHowever, global democracy has faced increasing threats in the post-Cold War era.\n@diamond2008 warned of a democratic recession at the end of the first decade of\nthe 21st century. According to @freedomhouse2024freedom, global freedom declined\nfor the 18th consecutive year in 2023. While relatively few countries have\nregressed from democracy to full-blown autocracy, the average level of democracy\nworldwide has reverted to pre-2000 levels. Most democratic recessions have\noccurred within regime categories, with democracies becoming less liberal and\nautocracies becoming less competitive and more repressive [@mechkova2017].\n\nDemocratic backsliding is a complex phenomenon with numerous contributing\nfactors. While the \"prime culprit\" remains a subject of debate, this dissertation\nwill focus on one critical factor: irregular power transitions. Irregular power\ntransitions, the acquisition of power outside established constitutional\nframeworks, play a significant role in democratic decline. They not only\nrepresent a violation of democratic norms but also disrupt the positive\ntrajectory towards a stable democracy. Furthermore, leaders who rise to power\nthrough irregular means often resort to undemocratic tactics. They may suppress\nopposition and stifle dissent to solidify their illegitimate hold on power. This\ncreates a vicious cycle, where democratic backsliding is used to maintain power,\nfurther eroding democratic institutions.\n\nAlthough irregular power transition is so important and has always been a central\ntopic in political science, a long asked question still intrigued political\nscientists: Why some leaders were ousted before their term expires, some can\naccomplish their term, while some can even overstay in office beyond their\noriginal mandated term limits. Or put it another way, why do some leaders rule\nfor decades while others stay in power for only years, months, or even days?\n\nDespite their central role in political science and the extensive research\nconducted on irregular power transitions, a long-standing question continues to\nintrigue political scientists: ***Why are some leaders ousted before their terms\nexpire, while others complete their full terms or even overstay beyond their\noriginally mandated limits?*** In other words, why do some leaders survive for\ndecades while others last for only years, months, or even days? This dissertation\nfocuses on this question and seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis, dedicated\nto understanding how leaders lose power unexpectedly and what factors determine\nthe duration of a leader's rule following an irregular ascent.\n\n### Analyses on coups and autocoups in a general framework\n\nWhen discussing irregular power transitions, the concepts that often come to mind\nare irregular entries or exits, such as coups, assassinations, rebellions,\nprotests, and foreign interventions. Among these methods, coups hold a prominent\nposition due to their frequent occurrence. According to the Archigos dataset\n[@goemans2009], from 1945 to 2015, there were approximately 145 instances of\nirregular leader exits, with coups accounting for more than half (79 leaders).\nThe often-cited coup dataset [@powell2011] records even more leaders (245 cases)\nremoved by coups from 1950 to 2023.\n\nGiven their prevalence and substantial influence on political systems, coups have\nbeen extensively studied, particularly since 2000 [@thyne2019]. Consequently, the\nconcept of a coup is comparatively clear and widely accepted in academic circles.\nMany scholars, including this study, follow the definition by @powell2011, which\ndescribes coups as \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites\nwithin the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive... \\[a coup is\nsuccessful\\] if the perpetrators seize and hold power for at least seven days\"\n(p. 252). Although debates persist, two elements are clear: first, the\nperpetrators are elites within the ruling group, and the victims of coups are\nincumbent executive leaders. Second, the strategy or aim of a coup involves\ncompletely removing the incumbents, not merely seizing part of their power or\nforcing them to concede on specific policies. Beyond defining coups, several\ndatasets have been developed for quantitative analyses, such as the Global\nInstances of Coups [@powell2011], the Cline Centre Coup d’État Project Dataset\n[@peyton2024], and the Colpus Dataset [@chin2021]. These datasets are\nwell-developed and frequently used in political science research.\n\nHowever, irregular power transitions are not limited to irregular entries and\nexits but should also include irregular \"overstays.\" Using illegal means to\noverthrow an incumbent leader before their term expires is undoubtedly an\nirregular power transition. Similarly, an incumbent using illegitimate means to\nextend their term beyond term limits is also an irregular power transition.\n\nAlthough academic attention to irregular retention of power has increased since\nthe 1990s, especially after Peru’s President Alberto Fujimori's self-coup in\n1992, it remains comparatively understudied and has several shortcomings. First,\nthere is no universally accepted terminology for this \"overstaying in power\" type\nof irregular power transition, unlike the clear term \"coup.\" Consequently,\nvarious terms such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive coup are used by\ndifferent scholars. This dissertation will use 'autocoup' to refer to this type\nof irregular power transition, which will be thoroughly discussed in Chapter 3.\nSecond, there is no consensus on the definition of an autocoup. Existing\ndefinitions remain vague, often conflating power expansions and power extensions.\nFor example, @cameron1998a defines an autogolpe as a temporary suspension of the\nconstitution and dissolution of Congress by the executive, who then rules by\ndecree. This definition focuses on power expansion instead of power extension,\nleading to conceptual confusion and misalignment with the definition of a classic\ncoup. Third, a consensus autocoup dataset is lacking. While several related\ndatasets exist, as discussed by @baturo2022 in coding their Incumbent Takeover\ndataset, the terminologies, definitions, and coverage years vary, lacking wide\nacknowledgment and extensive academic exploration. In summary, autocoup has not\nbeen analysed in a comparative manner connected with coups.\n\nAnalysing coups and autocoups separately is less problematic. However, from a\ncomprehensive framework perspective on irregular power transitions and leader\nsurvival, coups and autocoups should be, and can be, analysed within the same\nframework. Both coup and autocoup significantly influence democratic backsliding\nand are the most frequent means of irregular power transition. Furthermore, as\nboth are called \"coups,\" classic coups and autocoups are very similar since a\ncoup is launched to replace the current leader, while an autocoup is staged to\nreplace the future leader.\n\nExtant literature on irregular power transitions and leadership survival is\nmostly discussed separately by different scholars, using different concepts and\ndefinitions, and employing different methods and datasets. This study addresses\nthis gap by creating a comprehensive framework to analyze both coups and\nautocoups, focusing on their determinants and the survival of leaders who emerge\nfrom these events.\n\nWe contribute to the political science literature in three key ways. First, we\nemphasize the role of power dynamics, primarily determined by regime types, in\ndetermining coup success and, accordingly, coup attempts. Second, we introduce a\nrefined definition of autocoup and a novel dataset, allowing for comparative\nanalysis with classic coups. Third, using the existing coup dataset and the new\nautocoup dataset, we employ survival analysis to demonstrate how different entry\nmodes significantly affect leadership survival, providing a starting point for\nanalysing democratic resilience.\n\n### Overview of the thesis\n\nThis study includes three main chapters beyond the introduction.\n\n**Chapter 2** disscusses the determinants of classic coup attempts. Although coup\nresearch is extensive, most studies focus on the influence of observable factors\nlike economic performance, political stability, previous coups, or coup-proofing\nstrategies. This study, however, focuses on the more essential but less\nobservable factor-expected coup success rates, which is often overlooked by\nprevious studies. Using Heckman's two-staged sample selection model, we find\nevidence that success rates significantly influence coup attempts. The success\nrates are primarily influenced by the balance of power between incumbents and\nchallengers, which is greately determined by regime types. The results indicate\nthat military regimes face a much higher risk of coups compared to dominant-party\nregimes.\n\n**Chapter 3** clarifies the concept of autocoups, focusing on power extensions by\nincumbent leaders. By distinguishing autocoups from broader concepts like\nself-coups or executive takeovers, we redefine autocoups as instances where\nincumbent leaders refuse to transition power as mandated, thereby overstaying in\noffice. Based on this refined definition, we introduce a novel dataset of\nautocoup events from 1945 to 2022, including 110 attempts and 87 successes. Using\nthis dataset, we present case studies and empirical analysis to demonstrate its\nutility for quantitative research.\n\n**Chapter 4** examines how the method of power acquisition impacts the longevity\nof coup-entry and autocoup leaders. We hypothesize that the method of accession\nsignificantly affects leader tenure. Using the Cox proportional hazards model and\na time-dependent Cox model, we provide evidence of differing survival times\nbetween these two leader types. The findings indicate that coup-entry leaders\nface a significantly higher risk of removal compared to autocoup leaders. This\nunderscores the implications for political stability and democratic processes,\nsuggesting that the relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could\ntrigger incumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to\ndemocratic backsliding and personalization of power.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n",
