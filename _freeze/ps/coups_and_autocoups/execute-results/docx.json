Employing Heck’s two-stage sample selection model, we find that the expected chances of coup success play a crucial role in motivating coup attempts. These chances are significantly influenced by the power dynamics between the incumbent and potential coup plotters, which are, in turn, affected by regime types.\n  In contrast, autocoups have received less scholarly attention. This neglect stems partly from the underestimation of autocoups' impact on democratization and democratic resilience, and partly from the lack of a widely accepted definition and dataset. This study addresses these gaps by providing a refined definition of autocoups, reviewing existing terms and definitions such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive takeover. Based on this new definition, we introduce a novel dataset of autocoups that can facilitate more quantitative studies. Additionally, this study includes several case studies and an empirical analysis to demonstrate the utility of the new dataset in future research.\n  \n  Beyond power transitions, political leadership survival is another critical topic in political science. This study offers a comparative analysis of leadership survival following coups and autocoups. Using the Cox proportional hazards model and a time-dependent Cox model, we present compelling evidence of differing survival times between leaders who enter through coups and those who extend power via autocoups. The findings indicate that coup-entry leaders have a much shorter average tenure and a higher probability of being ousted compared to autocoup leaders. These results suggest that the relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could incentivize more incumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to democratic backsliding.\n  \n  This research makes several contributions to the academic literature. First, it provides a general and comparative framework for the most common irregular power transitions: coups and autocoups. Second, it introduces a refined definition and a dataset of autocoups, enabling comparative studies on the dynamics of irregular power transitions alongside coups. Finally, it highlights the significant influence of power transitions and leadership survival on democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, and personalization of power.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Power transitions, Leadership Survival]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Motivation of research\n\nIrregular power transitions are a central topic in political science, with coups\nbeing a significant focus due to their frequency and impact. According to the\nArchigos dataset [@goemans2009], from 1945 to 2015, there were approximately 145\ninstances of irregular leader exits, with coups[^1] accounting for more than half\n(79 leaders). The often-cited coup dataset [@powell2011] records even more\nleaders (245 cases) removed by coups from 1950 to 2023.\n\nGiven their prevalence and substantial influence on political systems, coups have\nbeen extensively studied, especially since 2000 [@thyne2019]. Consequently, the\nconcept of a coup is comparatively clear. Scholars often follow the definition by\n@powell2011, which describes coups as \"illegal and overt attempts by the military\nor other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive... \\[a\ncoup is successful\\] if the perpetrators seize and hold power for at least seven\ndays\" (p. 252). Although debates persist, two elements are clear: First, the\nperpetrators are elites within the ruling group targeting incumbent executive\nleaders. Second, the strategy involves completely removing the incumbents, not\nmerely seizing part of their power.\n\nNumerous datasets have been developed for studying coups, such as the Global\nInstances of Coups [@powell2011], the Cline Center Coup d’État Project Dataset\n[@peyton2024], and the Colpus Dataset [@chin2021]. These datasets are\nwell-developed and frequently used in political science research.\n\nIn contrast, autocoups are less studied. There is no widely accepted conceptual\ndefinition, and various terms, such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive\ntakeover, are used by different scholars. Consequently, a comprehensive dataset\nfor autocoups is lacking. Existing definitions often focus on the mode of power\ngrab, as seen in the case of Peru’s President Alberto Fujimori in 1992. For\nexample, @cameron1998a defines an autogolpe as a temporary suspension of the\nconstitution and dissolution of Congress by the executive, who then rules by\ndecree. This definition, and similar ones, do not clearly distinguish between\npower expansions and power extensions[^2], leading to conceptual confusion.\n\nThis issue is not as problematic when analyzing coups and autocoups separately.\nHowever, since both share the root concept of \"coup\", they should be defined in\nmore equivalent and related manner. If we aim to establish a general framework\nfor irregular power transitions and leader survival, defining autocoups in a\nmanner equivalent to coups is essential. While coups are significant for their\nrole in irregular power transitions, autocoups are important as well because they\nprevent the expected transition of power. A comparative analysis of the survival\nof leaders who come to power through coups versus autocoups is both interesting\nand important.\n\nThis study addresses this gap by creating a comprehensive framework for analyzing\ncoups and autocoups, particularly their determinants and the survival of leaders\nwho emerge from these events. We contribute to the political science literature\nin three main aspects. First, we emphasize the role of power dynamics, primarily\ndetermined by regime types, in determining coup success and, consequently, coup\nattempts. Second, we introduce a refined definition of autocoup and a novel\ndataset, allowing for comparative analysis with classic coups. Third, using the\nexisting coup dataset and the new autocoup dataset, we employ survival analysis\nto demonstrate how different entry modes significantly affect leadership\nsurvival, providing a starting point for analyzing democratic resilience.\n\nBy doing so, we gain clearer insights into the factors that determine irregular\npower transition attempts and their success or failure, and why leaders entering\npower through different methods may have varying survival rates.\n\n### Overview of Chapters\n\nThis study includes three main chapters beyond the introduction.\n\n**Chapter 2:** Discusses the determinants of classic coup attempts. Although coup\nresearch is extensive, most studies focus on the influecne of observable factors\nlike economic performance, political stability, previous coups, or coup-proofing\nstrategies. This study, however, focuses on the more essential but less\nobservable factor-expected coup success rates, which is often overlooked by\nprevious studies. Using Heckman's two-staged sample selection model, we find\nevidence that success rates significantly influence coup attempts. The success\nrates are primarily influenced by the balance of power between incumbents and\nchallengers, which is greately determined by regime types. The results indicate\nthat military regimes face a much higher risk of coups compared to dominant-party\nregimes.\n\n**Chapter 3:** Clarifies the concept of autocoups, focusing on power extensions\nby incumbent leaders. By distinguishing autocoups from broader concepts like\nself-coups or executive takeovers, we redefine autocoups as instances where\nincumbent leaders refuse to transition power as mandated, thereby overstaying in\noffice. Based on this refined definition, we introduce a novel dataset of\nautocoup events from 1945 to 2022, including 110 attempts and 87 successes. Using\nthis dataset, we present case studies and empirical analysis to demonstrate its\nutility for quantitative research.\n\n**Chapter 4:** Examines how the method of power acquisition impacts the longevity\nof coup-entry and autocoup leaders. We hypothesize that the method of accession\nsignificantly affects leader tenure. Using the Cox proportional hazards model and\na time-dependent Cox model, we provide evidence of differing survival times\nbetween these two leader types. The findings indicate that coup-entry leaders\nface a significantly higher risk of removal compared to autocoup leaders. This\nunderscores the implications for political stability and democratic processes,\nsuggesting that the relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could\nincentivize incumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to\ndemocratic backsliding and personalization of power.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: According to the Archigos dataset, \"Removed by Military, without Foreign\n    Support\" and \"Removed by Other Government Actors, without Foreign Support\" in\n    the variable `exitcode` are classified as coups.\n\n[^2]: Power expansion and power extension are somewhat ambiguous terms. In this\n    study, we define power expansion as acquiring additional powers beyond those\n    originally associated with the leader's role or position. Conversely, we\n    define power extension as lengthening a leader’s tenure beyond the originally\n    mandated term.\n",
