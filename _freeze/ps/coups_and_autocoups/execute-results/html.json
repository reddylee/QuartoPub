It\nhighlights the critical role of power dynamics, shaped by regime types, in\ndetermining coup success rates and attempt frequency. Utilizing Heckman's\ntwo-stage selection model, the study reveals that expected coup success\nsignificantly influences attempts, with military regimes facing a heightened\nvulnerability due to their power structure.\n\nWhile often understudied, autocoups are shown to have a substantial impact on\ndemocratic trends. This research introduces a refined definition of autocoups\nalongside a novel dataset encompassing events from 1945 to 2022, enabling a more\nrobust quantitative analysis.\n\nEmploying survival analysis, the study compares the longevity of leaders who rise\nto power through coups versus autocoups. The findings demonstrate that\ncoup-installed leaders face a significantly shorter tenure and higher risk of\nremoval. This contrasts with autocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend\ntheir rule, suggesting the potential for autocoups to incentivize power grabs and\ncontribute to democratic backsliding.\n\nThis work contributes significantly to the political science literature by:\n\n-   Defining key concepts: It establishes a clear definition of autocoups, a\n    previously understudied phenomenon.\n\n-   Introducing a novel dataset: This dataset enables researchers to conduct more\n    comprehensive quantitative analyses of autocoups.\n\n-   Establishing a general framework: The framework provides a comparative\n    approach to studying the dynamics of irregular power transitions and their\n    impact on democratic stability.\n\n**keywords:** *Coups, Autocoups, Power transitions, Leadership Survival*\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Research question\n\nIrregular power transitions, marked by a disregard for constitutional procedures,\nare a critical area of study in political science. They not only disrupt\nestablished rules but often require unconstitutional tactics to secure power.\nFurthermore, these transitions can inspire copycat behaviour among other\nambitious leaders.\n\nDespite their central role in political science and the extensive research\nconducted on irregular power transitions, a long-standing question continues to\nintrigue political scientists: ***Why are some leaders ousted before their terms\nexpire, while others complete their full terms or even overstay beyond their\noriginally mandated limits?*** In other words, why do some leaders survive for\ndecades while others last for only years, months, or even days? This dissertation\nfocuses on this question and seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis, dedicated\nto understanding how leaders come to power through unconstitutional means and\nwhat factors determine the duration of a leader's rule following an irregular\nascent.\n\n### Analyses on coups and autocoups in a general framework\n\nWhen discussing irregular power transitions, the concepts that often come to mind\nare irregular entries or exits, such as coups, assassinations, rebellions,\nprotests, and foreign interventions. Among these methods, coups hold a prominent\nposition due to their frequent occurrence. According to the Archigos dataset\n[@goemans2009], from 1945 to 2015, there were approximately 145 instances of\nirregular leader exits, with coups[^1] accounting for more than half (79\nleaders). The often-cited coup dataset [@powell2011] records even more leaders\n(245 cases) removed by coups from 1950 to 2023.\n\nGiven their prevalence and substantial influence on political systems, coups have\nbeen extensively studied, particularly since 2000 [@thyne2019]. Consequently, the\nconcept of a coup is comparatively clear and widely accepted in academic circles.\nMany scholars, including this study, follow the definition by @powell2011, which\ndescribes coups as \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites\nwithin the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive... \\[a coup is\nsuccessful\\] if the perpetrators seize and hold power for at least seven days\"\n(p. 252). Although debates persist, two elements are clear: first, the\nperpetrators are elites within the ruling group, and the victims of coups are\nincumbent executive leaders. Second, the strategy or aim of a coup involves\ncompletely removing the incumbents, not merely seizing part of their power or\nforcing them to concede on specific policies. Beyond defining coups, several\ndatasets have been developed for quantitative analyses, such as the Global\nInstances of Coups [@powell2011], the Cline Centre Coup d’État Project Dataset\n[@peyton2024], and the Colpus Dataset [@chin2021]. These datasets are\nwell-developed and frequently used in political science research.\n\nHowever, irregular power transitions are not limited to irregular entries and\nexits but should also include irregular \"overstays.\" Using illegal means to\noverthrow an incumbent leader before their term expires is undoubtedly an\nirregular power transition. Similarly, an incumbent using illegitimate means to\nextend their term beyond term limits is also an irregular power transition.\n\nAlthough academic attention to irregular retention of power has increased since\nthe 1990s, especially after Peru’s President Alberto Fujimori's self-coup in\n1992, it remains comparatively understudied and has several shortcomings. First,\nthere is no universally accepted terminology for this \"overstaying in power\" type\nof irregular power transition, unlike the clear term \"coup.\" Consequently,\nvarious terms such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive coup are used by\ndifferent scholars. This dissertation will use 'autocoup' to refer to this type\nof irregular power transition, which will be thoroughly discussed in Chapter 3.\nSecond, there is no consensus on the definition of an autocoup. Existing\ndefinitions remain vague, often conflating power expansions and power\nextensions[^2]. For example, @cameron1998a defines an autogolpe as a temporary\nsuspension of the constitution and dissolution of Congress by the executive, who\nthen rules by decree. This definition focuses on power expansion instead of power\nextension, leading to conceptual confusion and misalignment with the definition\nof a classic coup. Third, a consensus autocoup dataset is lacking. While several\nrelated datasets exist, as discussed by @baturo2022 in coding their Incumbent\nTakeover dataset, the terminologies, definitions, and coverage years vary,\nlacking wide acknowledgement and extensive academic exploration. In summary,\nautocoup has not been analysed in a comparative manner connected with coups.\n\nAnalysing coups and autocoups separately is less problematic. However, from a\ncomprehensive framework perspective on irregular power transitions and leader\nsurvival, coups and autocoups should be, and can be, analysed within the same\nframework. Both coup and autocoup significantly influence democratic backsliding\nand are the most frequent means of irregular power transition. Furthermore, as\nboth are called \"coups,\" classic coups and autocoups are very similar since a\ncoup is launched to replace the current leader, while an autocoup is staged to\nreplace the future leader.\n\n### Academic Contributions\n\nThis study addresses a critical gap in the literature by offering a comprehensive\nframework for analysing both coups and autocoups, which are the most common forms\nof irregular power transitions. While existing research often examines these\ntopics separately with varying terminologies, definitions, methods, and datasets,\nthis dissertation integrates these elements to provide a unified perspective on\nirregular power transitions and leader survival.\n\nOur contributions are threefold:\n\n-   **Emphasis on power dynamics and regime types**: We highlight the significant\n    role of power dynamics, particularly the influence of regime types, in\n    determining the success and frequency of coup attempts. Our analysis\n    underscores how the expected chances of coup success motivate such attempts,\n    with military regimes being notably susceptible.\n\n-   **Refined definition and novel dataset for autocoups:** We introduce a\n    refined definition of autocoups and develop a novel dataset covering events\n    from 1945 to 2022. This enables a comparative analysis with classic coups,\n    providing clearer insights into the nature and impact of autocoups on\n    political systems.\n\n-   **Survival analysis of leaders from different entry modes:** By applying\n    survival analysis to existing coup data and our new autocoup dataset, we\n    demonstrate how different modes of entry into power significantly affect\n    leader survival. Our findings reveal that leaders who come to power through\n    coups typically have shorter tenures and face higher removal risks compared\n    to those who extend their rule through autocoups.\n\nOur analysis of irregular power transitions is particularly relevant to\nunderstanding democratic backsliding. These transitions violate democratic norms\nand disrupt the path towards stable democracy. Leaders who gain power through\nirregular means often employ undemocratic tactics, such as suppressing\nopposition, to consolidate their illegitimate hold on power. This creates a\nvicious cycle where the erosion of democratic institutions is both a cause and\nconsequence of efforts to maintain power.\n\n### Overview of the thesis\n\nThis study is structured into three main chapters beyond the introduction, each\naddressing key aspects of irregular power transitions and their implications for\npolitical stability and democratic processes.\n\n**Chapter 2** examines the determinants of classic coup attempts. While extensive\nresearch exists on coups, most studies focus on observable factors such as\neconomic performance, political stability, previous coups, and coup-proofing\nstrategies. This chapter, however, emphasizes the less observable but crucial\nfactor of expected coup success chances, which has been often overlooked.\nUtilizing Heckman's two-staged sample selection model, the analysis reveals that\nexpected success rates significantly influence coup attempts. These success rates\nare primarily shaped by the balance of power between incumbents and challengers,\nwhich is largely determined by regime types. The findings indicate that military\nregimes face a much higher risk of coups compared to dominant-party regimes.\n\n**Chapter 3** focuses on the concept of autocoups, specifically on power\nextensions by incumbent leaders. It distinguishes autocoups from broader concepts\nlike self-coups or executive coups by redefining them as instances where\nincumbent leaders refuse to transition power as mandated, thereby overstaying in\noffice. Based on this refined definition, a novel dataset of autocoup events from\n1945 to 2022 is introduced, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successes. The\nchapter includes case studies and empirical analyses that demonstrate the utility\nof this dataset for quantitative research, providing a basis for empirical\nanalysis on autocoups.\n\n**Chapter 4** investigates how the method of power acquisition impacts the\nlongevity of leaders who come to power through coups versus those who extend\ntheir rule through autocoups. The hypothesis is that the method of accession\nsignificantly affects leader tenure. Using the Cox proportional hazards model and\na time-dependent Cox model, the chapter provides evidence of differing survival\ntimes between these two types of leaders. The results indicate that leaders who\ncome to power through coups face a significantly higher risk of removal compared\nto those who extend their rule through autocoups. This finding highlights the\nimplications for political stability and democratic processes, suggesting that\nthe relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could incentivize\nincumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to democratic\nbacksliding and the personalization of power.\n\nIn **Chapter 5**, the study concludes by summarizing the main findings,\ndiscussing policy implications, and acknowledging the limitations of the\nresearch. It also outlines directions for future research, emphasizing the need\nfor further exploration of irregular power transitions, particularly coups and\nautocoups.\n\n## Power Dynamics and Coup Attempts: A Selection Mechanism Analysis\n\n## Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Analysis of Power Extensions by Incumbent Leaders\n\n## Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival: A Comparative Analysis of Coup-Entry and Autocoup Leaders\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Main Findings\n\nThis study delves into the dynamics and implications of irregular power\ntransitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. The findings illuminate the complex\ninterplay between incumbents and challengers fighting for power.\n\nFirstly, our analysis reveals that the expected success rate of a coup attempt\nsignificantly influences its likelihood. This success rate is heavily influenced\nby the balance of power between the incumbent regime and challengers, which is\nlargely determined by regime type. We find that military regimes, although with\nmore control over their own military forces, face a higher risk of coups compared\nto dominant-party regimes.\n\nSecondly, the study introduces a redefined concept: the autocoup. Defined as an\nincumbent leader's refusal to relinquish power as mandated, this research\ndistinguishes autocoups from broader terms like self-coups. Based on this\ndefinition, we present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events\nfrom 1945 to 2022, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups. Case\nstudies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset's utility for quantitative\nresearch, providing a robust foundation for further analysis on autocoups.\n\nThirdly, employing survival analysis techniques, the study finds clear\ndifferences in leader longevity between those who come to power through coups and\nthose who extend their rule through autocoups. The results indicate that\ncoup-installed leaders face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to\nautocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend their rule.\n\n### Policy Implications\n\nThe findings of this study offer valuable insights for policy-makers concerned\nwith promoting and protecting global democracy, which has faced increasing\nchallenges despite a general post-WWII trend towards democratization. Notably,\nthe \"third wave\" of democratization [@huntington1991democratization] witnessed a\nsurge in democratic transitions in the late 20th century. Since the Cold War's\nend, democratic nations have outnumbered non-democratic ones (@fig-democracy)\nwith the gap widening.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nREIGN |>\n  filter(year > 1945 & year < 2021) |> \n  mutate(democracy = case_when(\n    gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"parliamentary\", \"presidential\") ~ \"Democracy\",\n    .default = \"Non-democracy\")) |> \n  summarise(Count = n(), \n            .by = c(year, democracy)) |> \n  #view()\n  ggplot(aes(year, Count, color = democracy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(color = 'Regime type',\n       x = \"Years: 1945 ~ 2020\",\n       y = \"No. of Countries\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    label = \"Data source: REIGN (Regime data)\",\n    x = 2010,\n    y = 30,\n    fontface = \"italic\",\n    size = 3\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of the number of democratic and non-democratic countries (1945-2020)](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-html/fig-democracy-1.png){#fig-democracy fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHowever, a \"democratic recession\" has emerged in recent years [@diamond2008].\nFreedom House reports an 18th consecutive year of global freedom decline in 2023\n[@freedomhouse2024freedom]. While few countries have completely regressed to\nautocracy, the average global democracy level has fallen back to pre-2000 levels.\nNotably, democratic backsliding often occurs within regimes, with democracies\nbecoming less liberal and autocracies becoming less competitive [@mechkova2017].\n\nThis research highlights irregular power transitions as a significant factor in\ndemocratic backsliding within regimes. These transitions, often coups or\nautocoups, violate democratic norms and disrupt the path towards stable\ndemocracies. Leaders who gain power through irregular means often resort to\nundemocratic tactics to maintain control, creating a vicious cycle of eroding\ndemocratic institutions.\n\nOur findings suggest that the shorter lifespans and potentially severe\nconsequences associated with coups may deter potential coup leaders. Conversely,\nautocoups appear to be a more tempting option for power-hungry leaders due to\ntheir higher success rates, seemingly moderate consequences, and extended leader\ntenure after the autocoup. This trend may explain the decline in classic coups\nsince the 1990s alongside the rise of autocoups [@bermeo2016].\n\n### Limitations and directions for future research\n\nThis study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular power transitions,\nbut some limitations require further exploration:\n\n-   **Data refinement:** Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach.\n    Future research should validate this classification system through additional\n    studies and expert evaluations.\n\n-   **Data harmonization:** The current analysis faces challenges due to\n    mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup\n    datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for\n    more robust comparisons.\n\n-   **Democratic backsliding:** While this study establishes a connection between\n    irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical\n    evidence is needed to solidify this link.\n\nSeveral avenues exist for future research:\n\n-   **Terminology and data collection:** Refining the \"autocoup\" concept and\n    achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive\n    data collection.\n\n-   **Dataset expansion:** Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and\n    integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can\n    provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.\n\n-   **Power dynamics and long-term impacts:** Utilizing this dataset, future\n    studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the\n    long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems,\n    particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization\n    of power.\n\nIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the dynamics of irregular power\ntransitions, specifically focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining\nautocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader\nlongevity, we establish a framework for understanding irregular transitions and\nleader survival. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of democratic\nresilience and political stability. Future research can build upon this\nfoundation by conducting further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup\ndataset and continuing to refine the framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: According to the Archigos dataset, \"Removed by Military, without Foreign\n    Support\" and \"Removed by Other Government Actors, without Foreign Support\" in\n    the variable `exitcode` are classified as coups.\n\n[^2]: The definitions and concepts of power expansion and power extension can be\n    vague.
