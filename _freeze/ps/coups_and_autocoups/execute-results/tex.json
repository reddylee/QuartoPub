Through\na rigorous analysis of historical data, case studies, and quantitative modeling,\nthis dissertation contributes to the broader understanding of political power\ndynamics and the intricate factors that shape leadership survival in the wake of\nirregular transitions.\n\nThe study first highlights the critical role of power dynamics, shaped by regime\ntype, in determining coup success rates and attempt frequency. Utilizing a double\nprobit model with sample selection, the research reveals that the expected\nchances of coup success significantly influence coup attempts, with military\nregimes facing heightened vulnerability due to their power structure.\n\nWhile often understudied, autocoups are shown to have a substantial impact on\ndemocratic backsliding. This research introduces a refined definition of\nautocoups alongside a novel dataset encompassing events from 1945 to 2023,\nenabling more robust quantitative analysis.\n\nEmploying survival analysis, the study compares the longevity of leaders who rise\nto power through coups versus autocoups. The findings demonstrate that\ncoup-installed leaders face significantly shorter tenures and higher risks of\nremoval. This contrasts with autocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend\ntheir rule, suggesting the potential for autocoups to motivate power grabs and\ncontribute to democratic backsliding.\n\nThis work contributes significantly to the political science literature by:\n\n-   Defining key concepts: Establishing a clear definition of autocoups, a\n    previously understudied phenomenon.\n\n-   Introducing a novel dataset: Enabling researchers to conduct more\n    comprehensive quantitative analyses of autocoups.\n\n-   Establishing a general framework: Providing a comparative approach to\n    studying both coups and autocoups, enabling analysis in a unified framework\n    for these two highly relevant political events and their potential effects on\n    democratic backsliding.\n\n***Keywords:** Coups, Autocoups, Power transitions, Leadership survival,\nDemocratic backsliding*\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Research Question and Context\n\nIrregular power transitions, characterised by a disregard for constitutional\nprocedures, represent a critical area of study in political science. These\ntransitions not only disrupt established rules but also often employ\nunconstitutional tactics to consolidate power post-transition. Moreover, such\nevents can inspire emulation among other ambitious leaders, potentially\ntriggering a cascade of similar actions across different political contexts.\n\nDespite extensive research on irregular power transitions, a fundamental question\ncontinues to challenge political scientists:\n\n**Why do some leaders face premature ousting while others extend their tenure\nbeyond constitutionally mandated limits?**\n\nThis inquiry extends to understanding the stark disparities in leadership\nlongevity, where some rulers maintain power for decades while others' tenures are\nmeasured in years, months, or even days.\n\nThis dissertation focuses on this central question, aiming to provide a\ncomprehensive analysis dedicated to understanding:\n\n-   How leaders ascend to or overstay in power through unconstitutional means.\n\n-   What factors determine the duration of a leader's rule following an irregular\n    ascent to power.\n\n### Coups and Autocoups: A Comparative Unified Framework for Irregular Power Transitions\n\nIn the study of irregular power transitions, coups have traditionally dominated\nacademic discourse due to their frequency and visibility. According to the\nArchigos dataset [@goemans2009], coups[^1] accounted for more than half of the\napproximately 145 irregular leader exits from 1945 to 2015. The Global Instances\nof Coups (GIC) dataset [@powell2011] records an even higher number, with 245\ncoup-related removals from 1950 to 2024.\n\nThe prevalence of coups has led to a well-established definition and extensive\nresearch, particularly since the turn of the millennium [@thyne2019]. This\nscholarly focus has resulted in a general consensus on the definition of coups,\nas well as the development of comprehensive datasets for quantitative analyses.\nWhile debates on the precise definition persist, most scholars, including this\nstudy, adhere to the definition proposed by @powell2011. This widely accepted\ndefinition encompasses two fundamental elements:\n\n-   **Perpetrators and Victims**: Perpetrators of coups are elites within the\n    existing power structure and the victims are incumbent executive leaders.\n\n-   **Strategy and Aim**: The primary objective is the complete removal of\n    incumbents from power.\n\nIt is important to note that this definition excludes actions that only partially\nchallenge the incumbent's authority or seek policy changes without aiming for a\ncomplete transfer of power.\n\nThe scholarly consensus on coup definition has facilitated the development of\nseveral comprehensive datasets, enabling rigorous quantitative analyses in\npolitical science research. Notable among these are: GIC Dataset, Cline Centre\nCoup d'État Project Dataset [@peyton2024], and Colpus Dataset [@chin2021]. These\ndatasets have become invaluable resources in political science, enabling\nresearchers to conduct large-scale, comparative studies on the causes, dynamics,\nand consequences of coups across different political contexts and historical\nperiods.\n\nHowever, another form of irregular power transition has been largely overlooked\nin power transition studies: leaders who refuse to relinquish power and extend\ntheir mandated terms. At least three challenges still exist in the analyses of\nthis type of irregular power transition:\n\n-   **Terminology**: Unlike the more widely accepted term \"coup,\" various terms\n    (e.g., self-coup, autogolpe, executive coup, incumbent takeover) are used to\n    describe this phenomenon.\n\n-   **Definition**: Existing definitions often conflate power expansion and power\n    extension[^2]. For instance, @cameron1998a defines an autogolpe primarily in\n    terms of power expansion, which does not align with the definition of coup.\n\n-   **Data**: A consensus dataset for autocoups is lacking, with existing\n    datasets varying in terminology, definitions, and coverage years @baturo2022.\n\nTo address this gap in the literature and provide a framework for analysis, we\npropose the term \"autocoup\" to describe this type of transition. This concept\nwill be extensively discussed and defined in Chapter 3, providing a basis for\nintegrating these events into the broader study of irregular power transitions\nand their impact on political systems and leader longevity.\n\nAnalysing coups and autocoups within a unified framework is crucial for a\ncomprehensive understanding of irregular power transitions and leader survival\nfor three reasons:\n\n-   Both phenomena significantly influence democratic backsliding and represent\n    the most frequent means of irregular power transition.\n-   Their similar nomenclature reflects a fundamental similarity: while a coup\n    aims to replace the current leader, an autocoup seeks to prevent the\n    succession of a future leader.\n-   This comparative approach will enable a more nuanced analysis of irregular\n    power transitions, contributing to our understanding of political stability,\n    democratic erosion, and leadership longevity in various regime types.\n\n### Academic Contributions\n\nThis study addresses a critical gap in the literature by offering a unified\nframework for analysing both coups and autocoups. My contributions are threefold:\n\n-   **Emphasis on Power Dynamics and Regime Types**: This study highlights the\n    significant role of power dynamics, particularly the influence of regime\n    types, in determining the success and frequency of coup attempts, underscores\n    how the expected chances of coup success motivate such attempts, with\n    military regimes being notably susceptible.\n-   **Refined Definition and Novel Dataset for Autocoups**: I introduce a refined\n    definition of autocoups, develop a novel dataset covering events from 1945 to\n    2024, and fill a significant gap in the existing literature and enable a\n    comparative analysis with classic coups.\n-   **Survival Analysis of Leaders from Different Entry Modes**: This research\n    applys survival analysis to existing coup data and the new autocoup dataset,\n    demonstrates how different modes of entry into power significantly affect\n    leader survival, and reveals that leaders who come to power through coups\n    typically have shorter tenures and face higher removal risks compared to\n    those who extend their rule through autocoups.\n\nThese contributions collectively advance the field by providing a more holistic\nunderstanding of irregular power transitions, offering new tools and data for\nquantitative analysis of autocoups, and demonstrating the interconnectedness of\npower acquisition methods and leadership survival.\n\nThis work lays the foundation for future research on the dynamics of political\npower, regime stability, and democratic backsliding, offering both theoretical\ninsights and practical implications for policy-makers and scholars alike.\n\n### Implications\n\nThe examination of irregular power transitions provides a crucial perspective on\nthe interrelated phenomena of democratic backsliding, breakdown, and autocratic\nintensification. The findings of this study provide logical explanations for\nseveral political phenomena:\n\n-   **Regression of Global Democracy Levels**: This study can explain why global\n    democracy levels have regressed to pre-2000 levels. For example, Freedom\n    House reports an 18th consecutive year of global freedom decline in 2023\n    [@freedomhouse2024freedom]. Irregular power transitions inevitably violate\n    democratic or constitutional norms and disrupt the trajectory towards stable\n    democracies or democratization from autocracies. Leaders who ascend through\n    irregular means often undermine constitutional norms to seize or overstay in\n    power, creating a vicious cycle of eroding democratic institutions.\n\n-   **Within-Regime Democratic Erosion**: This study explains why democratic\n    backsliding often occurs within regimes, with democracies becoming less\n    liberal and autocracies becoming less competitive [@mechkova2017]. This is\n    particularly because autocoups have become more prevalent than traditional\n    coups since 2000 [@bermeo2016]. Importantly, autocoups typically do not\n    result in immediate regime change, contributing to the observed pattern of\n    within-regime democratic erosion.\n\n-   **Prevalence of Autocoups Since 2000**: This research explains why autocoups\n    are more prevalent since 2000. Firstly, autocoups have a significantly higher\n    probability of success compared to traditional coups. Additionally, even when\n    unsuccessful, the repercussions of autocoups are generally less severe than\n    those of failed traditional coups. Moreover, successful autocoup leaders tend\n    to maintain power for substantially longer periods than leaders who enter\n    through traditional coups.\n\n### Overview of the Thesis\n\nThis study investigates irregular power transitions and their implications for\nleadership survival and democratic processes. I examine three key aspects:\nclassic coup attempts, autocoups, and how the method of power acquisition impacts\nleader longevity.\n\n#### Chapter 2: Determinants of Classic Coup Attempts {.unnumbered}\n\nThis chapter delves into the factors influencing classic coup attempts, with a\nnovel focus on the less observable but crucial factor of expected coup success\nrates. Key features include the utilization of a double probit model with sample\nselection and the analysis of how expected success rates significantly influence\ncoup attempts. It also examines how regime types shape the balance of power\nbetween incumbents and challengers, determining the chances of success of coups.\nFindings indicate a substantially higher coup risk in military regimes compared\nto dominant-party regimes.\n\n#### Chapter 3: Conceptualising and Analysing Autocoups {.unnumbered}\n\nThis chapter refines and analyses the concept of autocoups, with a specific focus\non power extensions by incumbent leaders. Notable elements include the\nredefinition of autocoups as instances where incumbent leaders refuse mandated\npower transitions. Introduction of a novel dataset covering autocoup events from\n1945 to 2024, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successes. Presentation of case\nstudies and empirical analyses demonstrating the utility of this dataset for more\nquantitative research in political science.\n\n#### Chapter 4: Impact of Power Acquisition Methods on Leadership Longevity {.unnumbered}\n\nThis chapter investigates how the method of power acquisition affects the tenure\nof leaders who ascend through coups versus those who extend their tenure via\nautocoups. Key aspects include hypothesis testing on the significant impact of\nthe accession method on leader tenure. Evidence of differing survival times\nbetween coup-entry and autocoup leaders, employing the Cox proportional hazards\nmodel and time-dependent Cox model. Analysis of how the risk-reward profile of\nautocoups might motivate democratic backsliding and power personalization.\n\n#### Chapter 5: Conclusion and Future Directions {.unnumbered}\n\nThe final chapter synthesizes the summary of key findings from each substantive\nchapter. Acknowledges study limitations and their potential impact on findings.\nOutlines future research directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration\nof irregular power transitions, particularly coups and autocoups.\n\n## Power Dynamics and Coup Attempts: A Selection Mechanism Analysis {#sec-chapter2}\n\n### Abstract {.unnumbered}\n\nDespite extensive research identifying around one hundred potential determinants\nof coup attempts, no consensus has been reached. This study introduces a novel\napproach that prioritizes determinants based on their impact on coup success. By\nanalysing coup success rates, the study hypothesizes that the expected outcomes\nof coups are critical determinants of their occurrence. Utilizing a double probit\nmodel with sample selection, the research investigates the relationship between\nregime types and coup attempts. The findings confirm that regime type, by shaping\ninternal power dynamics, is a crucial determinant of coup likelihood. Military\nand personalist regimes, characterized by weaker institutional frameworks and\nhigher vulnerability, demonstrate significantly higher susceptibility to coups\ncompared to dominant-party regimes.\n\n***Keywords:** Coups, Power transitions, Sample selection*\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoups d'état, defined by @powell2011 as \"illegal and overt attempts by the\nmilitary or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting\nexecutive\" (p. 252), represent a critical challenge to political stability and\ndemocratic governance worldwide. This chapter examines the complex dynamics of\ncoup attempts, their success rates, and the factors that influence both their\noccurrence and outcomes.\n\nCoups occur with varying frequency across countries and regions. For instance: In\nLatin America, Bolivia experienced\n23 coups between 1950 and 1984,\nwhile Argentina saw 20 during\na similar period. In Africa, Sudan endured\n17 coups between 1955 and 2023.\nContrastingly, countries like Mexico (1917-2000) and South Africa (since 1950)\nhave not experienced any coups.\n\nThis variability raises a fundamental question: **Why are coups more frequent in\nsome countries than others?**\n\nDespite decades of research, political scientists have yet to reach a consensus\non the key determinants of coups. @gassebner2016 highlight this challenge, noting\nthat approximately 100 potential factors have been proposed, with their study\ntesting 66 of these across three million model permutations. This proliferation\nof variables presents a critical issue: How can we establish a framework that\nallows scholars to focus on the most relevant factors, rather than navigating an\never-expanding list of potential determinants?\n\nMy analysis reveals a significant oversight in previous research: the exclusive\nfocus on pre-coup conditions without adequate consideration of post-coup factors.\nThis approach has neglected a critical element in coup dynamics – the expected\nprobability of success. Key observations supporting this perspective, as shown in\n@tbl-coups, include:\n\n-   **High-stakes nature of coups**: Failed coups often result in severe\n    consequences for perpetrators, including imprisonment, exile, or death.\n\n-   **Selectivity in coup attempts**: Despite 491 coup attempts since 1950, they\n    represent only about 4% of over 12,000 country-years in the same period (GIC\n    dataset).\n\n-   **Satisfactory success rate**: Approximately half of all coup attempts\n    succeed, suggesting careful selection of opportunities by plotters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.05\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.05\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lccr}\n\\toprule\nCountry & Coup Attempted & Coup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nBolivia & 23 & 11 & 47.8\\% \\\\ \nArgentina & 20 & 7 & 35.0\\% \\\\ \nSudan & 17 & 6 & 35.3\\% \\\\ \nHaiti & 13 & 9 & 69.2\\% \\\\ \nVenezuela & 13 & 0 & 0.0\\% \\\\ \nIraq & 12 & 4 & 33.3\\% \\\\ \nSyria & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nThailand & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nEcuador & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nBurundi & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nGuatemala & 10 & 5 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 491 & 245 & 49.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GIC dataset}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate clearly indicate that the\ninitiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup\noccurring depends greatly on its probability of success. However, this\nprobability is not directly observable to outsiders, including researchers, prior\nto a coup attempt.\n\nGiven the limitations in directly observing coup success probabilities, I propose\nfocusing on regime type as a crucial proxy for coup outcomes. This approach is\nbased on the following reasoning: Coup outcomes are ultimately determined by the\nbalance of power within a regime and regime types are classified based on control\nover the military, policy-making authority, and appointment of officials. By\nanalysing power dynamics across different regime types, we can gain valuable\ninsights into the structural factors shaping coup attempts and their outcomes.\n\nTo address the selection bias inherent in studying coup attempts, I employ a\ndouble probit model with sample selection. This approach allows for simultaneous\nanalysis of factors influencing both coup initiation and success.\n\nThrough this comprehensive analysis, I aim to provide a more nuanced\nunderstanding of the factors driving coup attempts and shaping their outcomes,\ncontributing to both scholarly discourse and practical efforts in two key ways:\n\n-   **Emphasis on expected chances of success**: By focusing on the probability\n    of success as a driver of coup attempts, I offer a more targeted approach to\n    understanding coup dynamics.\n\n-   **Highlighting the significance of regime type**: I demonstrate how regime\n    type influences coup likelihood, even when researchers lack perfect knowledge\n    of internal balance of power.\n\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 explores the\ndynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. Section 3 outlines the research\ndesign, methodology, and variables. Section 4 presents and discusses the\nempirical findings. Section 5 concludes with key insights and their implications\nfor understanding and potentially mitigating coup risks.\n\n### Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\n\nCoup attempts are driven by a complex interplay of factors, encompassing both the\nmotivations of potential challengers (**disposition**) and the resources and\nopportunities available to them (**capability**). This section delves into the\ndynamics of coup attempts, exploring the motivations behind them, the factors\ninfluencing their success, and the role of regime types in shaping coup\nsusceptibility.\n\n#### Motivations for coups\n\nThis section focuses on the motivations that compel actors to undertake coups,\ncategorizing them into three main types:\n\n-   **Personal Ambition:** The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth\n    serves as a significant motivator for many coup plotters. Seizing control\n    promises the ability to shape national policies, control resources, and make\n    impactful decisions without constraints. The pursuit of prestige,\n    recognition, potential economic gain, and the desire to leave a lasting\n    legacy can further incentivize individuals to undertake this risky endeavour.\n\n-   **Purported National Interest:** Coups are sometimes justified as necessary\n    interventions to address national crises, uphold the constitution, or\n    facilitate a transition to democracy. While such claims require scrutiny,\n    genuine examples exist. For instance, the 2010 coup in Niger ousted President\n    Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term by dissolving the\n    opposing court and calling a self-serving referendum [@ginsburg2019].\n\n-   **Self-Preservation:** In certain cases, coups act as pre-emptive strikes\n    against perceived threats. Coup leaders might not necessarily seek power for\n    themselves but rather fear elimination or political persecution by the\n    incumbent leaders. An example is Idi Amin's 1971 coup against Ugandan\n    President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his military command\n    position [@sudduth2017].\n\nThese motivations are often most prevalent in autocratic regimes, where\njustifications under the guise of national interest or self-preservation can mask\npersonal agendas. Stable democracies rarely face the same level of constitutional\ncrises or political persecution that might necessitate a coup. However, newly\nestablished democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and\ndemocratic backsliding, creating opportunities for coup plotters to exploit these\nweaknesses and justify their actions.\n\nDespite these potential motivations, coups remain relatively uncommon, occurring\nin only about 4% of country-years since 1950. This rarity highlights the\nimportance of capability – even the most motivated actors need the resources and\nopportunities to succeed.\n\n#### Capability for coups\n\nThe decision to attempt a coup hinges not only on motivation but also on a\ncalculated assessment of the chances of success. Several factors influence this\nassessment:\n\n-   **Military Strength**: A clear advantage in military capabilities compared to\n    the incumbent regime significantly increases the odds of a successful coup\n    [@powell2018; @choulis2022].\n\n-   **Internal Divisions within the Regime**: Existing fractures within the\n    government's power structure can be exploited by coup plotters to gain\n    support from disgruntled factions.\n\n-   **Public Support**: Widespread discontent with the incumbent regime,\n    especially within the military or key sectors of society, can create a ripe\n    environment for a successful coup.\n\n-   **Foreign Backing**: External support from powerful nations can provide\n    resources, legitimacy, and even direct military intervention to tip the\n    scales in favor of the coup plotters.\n\nWhile historical data might suggest a high success rate for coups, it is crucial\nto consider selection bias. We only observe attempted coups, not the numerous\nplots that never materialize. Analysing launched coup data alone can be\nmisleading. To understand coup attempts and their likelihood comprehensively, we\nneed a theoretical framework that accounts for this selection bias.\n\n#### **Effect of Expected Coup Outcomes on Coup Attempts**\n\nA frequently cited framework [@gassebner2016; @aidt2019] offers a structured\napproach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating\nthe anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected pay-off of a coup can be\nrepresented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq1}\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $E(U)$**:** Expected utility or pay-off of the coup attempt;\n-   $B$ represents the return of a successful coup;\n-   $C$ signifies the cost of a failed coup;\n-   $p$ represents the probability of coup success.\n\nThe condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive\n($E(U) > 0$). Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B > (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq2}\n\nThis implies that for a coup to be attempted, the expected benefits of success\nmust outweigh the expected costs of failure.\n\nQuantifying $B$ and $C$ is inherently difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or\nloved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after\na successful coup, are challenging to measure precisely.\n\nHowever, the framework's core logic remains valuable. Given the difficulty in\nprecisely quantifying $B$ and $C$, we can treat them as roughly equal. This\nallows us to shift our focus to the probability of success ($p$). The simplified\n@eq-eq2 becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np > (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq3}\n\nThis suggests that a success probability greater than 50% is necessary for a coup\nto be attempted. While empirical data shows a slightly lower overall success rate\nfor coups since 1950 (49.9%, as shown in @tbl-coups), it is crucial to remember\nthat this is an average and does not reflect the specific probabilities assessed\nby coup plotters beforehand.\n\nTherefore, in this study, unlike the majority of previous research that focuses\non the prerequisites for triggering a coup, I consider the expected coup outcome\nas the fundamental determinant of a coup. Based on this discussion, I propose the\nfirst hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: The fundamental determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of\n> success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.***\n\nThis leads to the next question: What factors determine coup success and\nconsequently influence the decision to attempt one? The answer lies in\nunderstanding the balance of power inherent in the different power dynamics\nacross various regime types.\n\n#### Regime types and power dynamics\n\nHistorical coup success rates do not dictate individual coup attempts as each one\nfaces different situation and conditions. Coup plotters assess their chances\nbased on their unique context. Although many factors determine the success of a\ncoup, ultimately, the decisive factor remains the comparison of strength between\nincumbents and coup perpetrators. More precisely, it is the comparison of their\nmilitary power.\n\nWhile military strength is often seen as the primary factor in coup attempts,\nleading to an oversimplification of coups as solely military events, the reality\nis far more complex [@singh2016]. The clandestine nature of coups necessitates\nsmall, secretive groups, making it difficult to gauge the stance of other\nfactions within the military. As @geddes1999 points out, the success of a coup\noften hinges on the reactions of these other factions. This uncertainty creates a\ncomplex decision-making environment for potential coup plotters. Furthermore,\nincumbents often employ strategic division within the military as a coup-proofing\nmeasure. @böhmelt2014 describe how leaders intentionally create rival groups\nwithin the armed forces, establishing an artificial balance and structural\nobstacles. In addition, factors beyond military force, such as internal divisions\nwithin the ruling elites, public support, and foreign backing, significantly\nshape the balance of power.\n\nTherefore, a more holistic approach involves analyzing the overall balance of\npower within a political system. However, as noted in the introduction of this\nchapter, directly observing this balance of power presents significant challenges\nfor outside observers. In stead, an alternative approach is to analyze the\nfactors that are decisive in shaping power dynamics. This method aligns more\nclosely with academic research goals, which are less concerned with identifying\nspecific power challengers capable of launching successful coups and more focused\non understanding the patterns and underlying factors of coup attempts.\n\nAmong the various factors that influence power dynamics, regime type emerges as\none of the most crucial. First of all, regime types are fundamentally\nclassifications based on power structures within a political system. Secondly,\ndifferent regime types allocate authority differently for critical decisions such\nas: deployment of military forces, appointment of key officials and military\nofficers, and formulation and implementation of main policies.\n\nprovide a classification of autocratic regime types based on their power\nstructures. This classification offers valuable insights into the power dynamics\nwithin different autocracies and their relative susceptibility to coups. The\nthree main types of autocratic regimes, their characteristics, and their\nvulnerability to coup attempts are explored as following (@tbl-regimes1).\n\n@geddes2014 provide a classification of autocratic regime types based on their\npower structures. The three main types in autocracies and their power dynamics\nare:\n\n-   **Military Regimes:** Characterized by a junta – a group of military officers\n    controlling leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include\n    regimes in Brazil (1964-1985), Argentina (1976-1983), and El Salvador\n    (1948-1984) [@geddes1999].\n\n    **Coup Susceptibility:** Despite their military nature, these regimes are\n    surprisingly unstable due to internal power struggles within the junta. The\n    absence of a clear final authority and the presence of multiple military\n    factions increase the likelihood of resorting to force to resolve disputes,\n    making these regimes the most vulnerable to coups.\n\n-   **Personalist Regimes:** Power is concentrated in a single, charismatic\n    leader who controls the military, policy, and succession. Examples include\n    Rafael Trujillo's regime in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin's\n    regime in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa's regime in the Central\n    African Republic (1966-1979) [@geddes1999].\n\n    **Coup Susceptibility:** Personalist regimes are relatively stable during the\n    leader's tenure. However, they face a higher risk of coups due to unclear\n    succession plans and vulnerabilities associated with the leader's personal\n    weaknesses, health, and mortality.\n\n-   **Dominant-Party Regimes:** Power resides within a well-organized ruling\n    party, with leaders acting as its representatives. The party structure and\n    ideology foster internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Examples include\n    the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary\n    Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European\n    countries [@geddes1999].\n\n    **Coup Susceptibility:** Dominant-party regimes exhibit the greatest\n    resilience against coups due to their institutionalized structures, unified\n    leadership, clear ideology, and internal discipline.\n\nEmpirical data also supports this theoretical framework. While military regimes\nrepresent only 5.6% of country-years since 1950, they experience a\ndisproportionate share of coups (over 22%). Personalist regimes, constituting 13%\nof country-years, account for 23% of coups. Conversely, dominant-party regimes,\nrepresenting 22.6% of country-years, account for only 16.7% of coups\n(@tbl-regimes). These statistics demonstrate the disproportionate vulnerability\nof military and personalist regimes to coups, while highlighting the relative\nstability of dominant-party regimes.\n\nThe distinct power dynamics exhibited by these regime types significantly\ninfluence their susceptibility to coups. This analysis leads to our second\nhypothesis:\n\nThe susceptibility to coups varies significantly among different types of\nautocratic regimes, with military regimes being the most vulnerable, followed by\npersonalist regimes, and dominant-party regimes being the least susceptible.\n\n> ***H2: The susceptibility to coups varies significantly among different types\n> of autocratic regimes, with military regimes being the most vulnerable,\n> followed by personalist regimes, and dominant-party regimes being the least\n> susceptible.***\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\blandscape\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regimes1 .cell tbl-cap='Main features of different types of regimes'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}}\n\\toprule\nRegime Type & Power Concentration & Succession & Military Alignment & Stability & Examples \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nMilitary & Junta & Unclear & May have significant influence & Low & Brazil (1964-1985), Argentina (1976-1983) \\\\ \nPersonalist & Single Leader & Unclear or dependent on leader's will & Subordinated to leader & Moderate (initially), Low (long-term) & Dominican Republic (Trujillo, 1930-1961) \\\\ \nDominant-Party & Party Leadership & Institutionalized & Aligned with the party & High & Mexico (PRI), China (CPC) \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GWF \\& Author}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regimes .cell tbl-cap='Regime types and coups since 1950'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lrrrrrr}\n\\toprule\nRegime Type & Country Year & Share & Num of Coups & Percent of Coups & Success Rate & Coup Likelihood \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nDemocracy & 5312 & 46.7\\% & 122 & 24.8\\% & 51.6\\% & 2.3\\% \\\\ \nDominant-Party & 2569 & 22.6\\% & 82 & 16.7\\% & 53.7\\% & 3.2\\% \\\\ \nPersonal & 1476 & 13.0\\% & 113 & 23.0\\% & 44.2\\% & 7.7\\% \\\\ \nMonarchy & 1056 & 9.3\\% & 25 & 5.1\\% & 56.0\\% & 2.4\\% \\\\ \nMilitary & 638 & 5.6\\% & 110 & 22.4\\% & 48.2\\% & 17.2\\% \\\\ \nOther & 322 & 2.8\\% & 39 & 7.9\\% & 53.8\\% & 12.1\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 11373 & 100.0\\% & 491 & 100.0\\% & 49.9\\% & 4.3\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\elandscape\n\n### Research Design\n\n#### Double probit with sample selection model {#sec-coup231}\n\nThis study employs a sophisticated statistical approach to account for the\nselective nature of coup attempts. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes,\nsuccess rates tend to be surprisingly consistent, hovering around 50% (as shown\nin @tbl-regimes). This suggests that coup attempts are not random acts, but\nrather strategically planned and undertaken only when the odds of success appear\nfavorable. A standard statistical model would not account for this selectivity,\npotentially leading to biased results.\n\nTo address this issue, we utilize a double probit with sample selection model,\nsimilar to the approach used by @powell2012 and @böhmelt2014. This model, known\nas a Heckman probit model or bivariate probit model with sample selection,\nconsists of two parts:\n\n-   **Selection Equation (Stage 1)**: This stage analyses the factors influencing\n    whether a coup attempt occurs in a particular country-year.\n\n-   **Outcome Equation (Stage 2)**: This stage focuses on the probability of\n    success for those coup attempts that actually take place.\n\nThe selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt\noccurs:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{1i}^*&=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{A} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\\\\n\\\\\ny_{1i} &= \n\\begin{cases} \n1 &\\text{if $y_{1i}^*>0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n\\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_{1i}^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq4}\n\nThe outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup attempt is\nsuccessful, given that it occurs:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{2i}^*&=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{Z}_i \\boldsymbol{B} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\\\\n\\\\\ny_{2i} &= \n\\begin{cases} \n1 &\\text{if $y_{2i}^*>0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n\\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_{2i}^*\\le0$ (coup failes)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq5}\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $y_{1i}^*$ *and* $y_{2i}^*$ are latent variables\n\n-   $\\text{Regime}_i$ is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or\n    dominant-party)\n\n-   $\\mathbf{X}_i$ and $\\mathbf{Z}_i$ are vectors of control variables\n\n-   $\\mu_{1i}$ and $\\mu_{2i}$ are error terms, assumed to follow a bivariate\n    normal distribution with correlation $\\rho$\n\nThe model assumes:\n\n$$\n\\binom{\\mu_{1 i}}{\\mu_{2 i}} \\sim N\\left(\\binom{0}{0},\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\rho \\\\\n\\rho & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe probability equations are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP\\left(y_{1 i}=1\\right) & =\\Phi\\left(\\alpha_0+\\alpha_1 \\operatorname{Regime}_i+\\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{A}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq7}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP\\left(y_{2 i}=1 \\mid y_{1 i}=1\\right) & =\\Phi\\left(\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\operatorname{Regime}_i+\\mathbf{Z}_i \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq8}\n\nWhere $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard\nnormal distribution.\n\n#### Variables\n\n##### Dependent variable\n\nThe analysis utilizes data on coup attempts and outcomes from @powell2011. A\nsuccessful coup is defined as one where the incumbent leader is removed from\npower for more than seven days. The dataset covers the period from 1950 to 2023\nand includes information on 491 coup attempts, with roughly half (245) being\nsuccessful. Descriptive statistics for these coup attempts and regime types can\nbe found in @tbl-coups and @tbl-regimes.\n\n-   **Coup Attempt**: Binary variable indicating whether a coup attempt\n    occurred (1) or not (0) in a given country-year.\n\n-   **Coup Success**: Binary variable indicating whether a coup attempt was\n    successful (1) or failed (0), conditional on a coup attempt occurring.\n\n##### Key Independent Variable: Regime Type {#sec-chapter2322}\n\nI categorize regime types following @geddes2014 (GWF), focusing on military,\npersonalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included\nfor comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in\n@tbl-regimes.\n\n##### Control variables {.unnumbered}\n\nThe control variables are chosen based on the research of @gassebner2016. They\nanalysed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic\ngrowth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are\nparticularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance,\npolitical violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control\nvariables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an\nindication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a\ncountry. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international 1000\ndollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by @fariss2022.\n-   **Economic Performance:** Measured using the current-trend ($CT$) ratio\ndeveloped by @krishnarajan2019. This ratio compares a country's current GDP\nper capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A\nhigher $CT$ ratio indicates stronger economic performance. For a country $i$\nat year $t$, the $CT$ ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n    \\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq6}\n\n-   **Political Stability:** This variable captures overall regime stability by\n    including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and\n    interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the\n    variable “actotal” in the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset\n    [@marshall2005current], with 0 representing the most stable conditions (no\n    violence at all) and 18 representing the most unstable.\n-   **Previous coups:** Included in the selection equation as either: a) The\n    number of previous coups in a country (Model 1), or b) The time since the\n    last coup attempt (Model 2 for robustness check).\n\n### Results and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coupmodel .cell tbl-cap='Sample Selection Model of Regime Type and Coup Success, 1950-2019'}\n\n\\begingroup \n\\small \n\\begin{tabular}{@{\\extracolsep{7pt}}lcccc} \n\\\\[-1.8ex]\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Model 1} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Model 2} \\\\ \n & Coup Attempts & Coup Outcome & Coup Attempts & Coup Outcome \\\\ \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & (1) & (2) & (3) & (4)\\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n Constant & $-$1.774$^{***}$ & $-$1.803$^{***}$ & $-$1.663$^{***}$ & $-$0.654 \\\\ \n  & (0.058) & (0.360) & (0.088) & (0.518) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Regime: Democracy & 0.056 & 0.068 & 0.043 & 0.042 \\\\ \n  & (0.072) & (0.121) & (0.075) & (0.192) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Military & 0.687$^{***}$ & 0.596$^{***}$ & 0.345$^{***}$ & 0.247 \\\\ \n  & (0.084) & (0.170) & (0.091) & (0.229) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Monarchy & 0.282$^{**}$ & 0.178 & 0.233$^{*}$ & 0.088 \\\\ \n  & (0.118) & (0.201) & (0.123) & (0.310) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist & 0.319$^{***}$ & 0.128 & 0.134$^{*}$ & $-$0.145 \\\\ \n  & (0.075) & (0.170) & (0.080) & (0.205) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Economic trend & $-$0.015$^{***}$ & $-$0.004 & $-$0.014$^{***}$ & 0.009 \\\\ \n  & (0.002) & (0.007) & (0.002) & (0.008) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n GDP per capita & $-$0.028$^{***}$ & $-$0.028$^{***}$ & $-$0.016$^{***}$ & $-$0.016 \\\\ \n  & (0.003) & (0.006) & (0.003) & (0.010) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Political violence & 0.033$^{**}$ & 0.033$^{*}$ & 0.038$^{***}$ & 0.025 \\\\ \n  & (0.013) & (0.020) & (0.013) & (0.031) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Previous coups (P) & 0.030$^{***}$ &  & 0.448$^{***}$ &  \\\\ \n  & (0.010) &  & (0.086) &  \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Yrs since coup (Y) &  &  & $-$0.018$^{***}$ &  \\\\ \n  &  &  & (0.004) &  \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Interaction term: P * Y &  &  & $-$0.013$^{***}$ &  \\\\ \n  &  &  & (0.005) &  \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \nObservations & 9,606 & 9,606 & 9,606 & 9,606 \\\\ \nLog Likelihood & $-$1,663.683 & $-$1,663.683 & $-$1,598.656 & $-$1,598.656 \\\\ \n$\\rho$ & 0.898$^{***}$  (0.158) & 0.898$^{***}$  (0.158) & 0.386$^{*}$  (0.234) & 0.386$^{*}$  (0.234) \\\\ \n\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n\\textit{Note:}  & \\multicolumn{4}{r}{$^{*}$p$<$0.1; $^{**}$p$<$0.05; $^{***}$p$<$0.01} \\\\ \n\\end{tabular} \n\\endgroup \n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe double probit model with sample selection, estimated using the\n***sampleSelection*** package [@sampleSelection-2] in R, provides valuable\ninsights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their outcomes across\ndifferent regime types from 1950 to 2019 (@tbl-coupmodel).

The military regime's marginal effect of 0.07 indicates that\nthe probability of coup attempts in military regimes is 7 percentage points (pp)\nhigher than in dominant-party regimes, ceteris paribus. This translates to\nmilitary regimes being about 277.7% more likely to encounter coups than\ndominant-party regimes. Similarly, personalist regimes show a 2.4 pp higher\nprobability, about 94% more likely compared to dominant-party regimes.\n\nControl variables show effects in expected directions but with weaker magnitudes.\nStronger economic performance, indicated by higher economic growth trends and GDP\nper capita levels, correlates with a lower risk of coup attempts. Political\nviolence shows a positive effect, indicating that higher levels of instability\nincrease the likelihood of coups. The positive coefficient for the number of\nprevious coups suggests a \"copycat\" effect from earlier incidents.\n\n#### Outcome Model: Coup Success\n\nThe outcome model (Columns 2 and 4 in @tbl-coupmodel) reveals determinants of\ncoup success. Military regimes demonstrate a higher probability of coup success\ncompared to dominant-party regimes, aligning with expectations that military\nregimes face higher coup risks due to their increased chances of success.\nPersonalist and monarchical regimes show slight positive effects on coup success,\nbut these effects are not statistically significant.\n\nControl variables exhibit different patterns in the outcome model compared to the\nselection model.

This supports the appropriateness of\nthe sample selection model and underscores the importance of considering both\nstages in the analysis.\n\nThe significant coefficients with theoretically consistent directions suggest the\nmodel effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. The observed disparity\nbetween coup attempt rates and success rates across regimes points towards\nselection bias, further validating the use of the sample selection model.\n\n#### Theoretical Implications\n\nThese results strongly support my theoretical framework, highlighting the crucial\nrole of regime structure in determining coup vulnerability. The findings\nunderscore that coups are strategic actions undertaken when odds appear\nfavourable, rather than random events.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis study addresses the lack of consensus in empirical research on coup\npredictors by introducing a novel approach that prioritizes determinants based on\ntheir impact on coup success. By analysing coup success rates, I posit that the\nexpected outcomes of coups are critical determinants of their occurrence.\nEmploying a double probit model with sample selection, the research investigates\nand confirms a strong and robust relationship between regime types and coup\nattempts.\n\nThe main findings reveal that regime type plays a pivotal role in the likelihood\nof coup attempts. Military and personalist regimes, characterized by weaker\ninstitutional frameworks and higher vulnerability, demonstrate significantly\nhigher susceptibility to coups compared to dominant-party regimes. This\nunderscores the importance of supporting initiatives that establish regimes with\nconstitutional institutions rather than those dependent on military power or\npersonal authority, as the latter prove more volatile and coup-prone.\n\nThe research also indicates that stronger economic performance, while not as\ninfluential as regime type, is associated with a lower risk of coups. This\nsuggests that policies promoting economic development can be effective in\nreducing coup risk. Given that regime type is often determined during regime\nformation and is difficult to alter, promoting economic growth might be the most\nviable coup-proofing strategy available to incumbents.\n\nHowever, these findings present a paradox for autocratic leaders, particularly\ndictators and military juntas. While institutionalization of regimes could\nenhance stability and reduce coup risk, few such leaders are willing to implement\nthese reforms. This reluctance stems from the potential constraints on their\npower or shortened terms that such changes might entail. Thus, while institutions\nmay benefit the regime's longevity, they do not necessarily serve the immediate\ninterests of individual leaders.\n\nThis study opens avenues for further research, including:\n\n-   Investigating the long-term effects of regime types on political stability,\n    including democratization or personalization.\n\n-   Examining how international factors might influence regime choices and coup\n    dynamics when internal factors are too weak to prevent coups.\n\nIn conclusion, this chapter provides robust evidence for the critical role of\nregime type in determining coup risk, while also acknowledging the complex\nrealities of political power. By illuminating the strategic calculus behind coup\nattempts, it offers valuable insights for scholars seeking to understand\npolitical instability and policymakers working to promote democratic transitions\nand political stability in diverse global contexts.\n\n## Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Analysis of Power Extensions by Incumbent Leaders {#sec-chapter3}\n\n### Abstract {.unnumbered}\n\nThis study aims to clarify the concept of autocoups, specifically focusing on\npower extensions by incumbent leaders. By distinguishing autocoups from the\nbroader and more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or executive takeovers, which\nencompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research\nredefines the concept of autocoups. Based on this refined definition, I introduce\na novel dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2024. Using this newly compiled\ndataset, the research includes three types of case studies that provide\nqualitative insights into the dynamics of autocoups. Additionally, an empirical\nanalysis of the determinants of autocoup attempts and success is offered to\ndemonstrate how the autocoup dataset can be employed for more quantitative\nresearch. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing a\nclearer conceptual framework and a novel dataset of autocoups. It enhances our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by\nincumbent leaders and examines the implications for democratic backsliding,\ndemocratic breakdown, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this\nstudy could draw more attention to the effects of autocoups on power transitions,\npolitical stability, and democratic resilience.\n\n***keywords**: Autocoups, Coups, Power transitions*\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe study of irregular power transitions has predominantly focused on coups due\nto their frequency and significant impact. This emphasis has led to substantial\nscholarly attention and the creation of comprehensive datasets. However, as noted\nby @gassebner2016, the multitude of potential factors proposed to explain coups\nhas often resulted in increased confusion rather than a clearer understanding of\ncoup dynamics.\n\nIn contrast, another form of irregular power transition—the incumbent leader's\nrefusal to relinquish power—has received relatively less attention despite its\nsignificance. Recent decades have witnessed a decline in traditional coups and a\nrise in this \"incumbent retention or overstay\" type of irregular power\ntransition, particularly since the end of the Cold War (@ginsburg2010evasion;\n@baturo2014; @versteeg2020law).\n\nThis chapter will redefine and clarify this type of irregular power transition,\nwhere leaders overstay their mandated term limits, as \"autocoup.\" Although\nanalyses related to autocoups are not rare, the existing literature exhibits\nseveral notable shortcomings:\n\n-   **Terminological Ambiguity:** Terms such as self-coups, autocoups,\n    autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay, and\n    continuismo are used without a clear, universally accepted definition. This\n    lack of standardization leads to confusion and inconsistent application\n    [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022].\n\n-   **Limited Data:** Due to the conceptual ambiguity surrounding autocoups, data\n    collection remains in its early stages compared to the rich datasets\n    available for traditional coups.\n\n-   **Methodological Gaps:** Research on autocoups has largely relied on case\n    studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], with few studies\n    employing quantitative analysis.\n\nMoreover, analyses of autocoups are often not integrated with those of\ntraditional coups. As a distinct category of coup, autocoups lack a corresponding\ndefinition in relation to classic coups. Consequently, traditional coups and\nautocoups are frequently analysed separately, despite their related nature, and\nthere is a paucity of comparative analyses.\n\nStudying autocoups is important for several reasons. Firstly, autocoups can\nundermine the rule of law, weaken institutions, and contribute to democratic\nbacksliding or authoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups,\nsuccessful autocoups increase the likelihood of future irregular power\ntransitions. For example, since 1945, approximately 62% of leaders who extended\ntheir terms through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either ousted or\nassassinated while in office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed autocoups often lead\nto instability, inciting protests, violence, and even civil wars.\n\nThis chapter aims to address these gaps by focusing on autocoups, aiming to\nclarify terminology, refine concepts and definitions, enhance data collection,\nand explore determinants through empirical analysis, contributing in three key\nareas:\n\n-   **Conceptual Clarification:** The term \"autocoup\" will be redefined and\n    clarified, with a focus on power extension.\n\n-   **Data Collection:** A new dataset of autocoups since 1945 will be introduced\n    based on this refined definition.\n\n-   **Empirical Analysis:** Utilizing this dataset, a quantitative analysis of\n    the factors influencing leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups will be\n    conducted.\n\nThe structure of this chapter is as follows: Section 2 will review definitions\nrelated to power expansions and extensions, leading to a precise definition of\nautocoups. Section 3 will present the new autocoup dataset. Sections 4 and 5 will\nexplore the determinants of autocoup attempts through case studies and\ndemonstrate the application of the dataset in empirical analysis. The conclusion\nwill summarize key findings and suggest directions for future research.\n\nDefinitions of power expansion and power extension in political science can often\nbe ambiguous or overlapping. To ensure clarity in this study, we propose distinct\ndefinitions for these concepts:\n\n-   Power Expansion: This refers to the process by which an incumbent leader\n    acquires additional authority or control over state apparatuses beyond their\n    original mandate. This may involve centralizing power, reducing checks and\n    balances, or assuming roles typically held by other branches of government.\n\n-   Power Extension: This concept specifically relates to the temporal aspect of\n    an incumbent's rule. It describes situations where a leader prolongs their\n    tenure beyond the originally mandated term in office, often through\n    constitutional amendments, cancellation of elections, or other means of\n    circumventing term limits.\n\nBy distinguishing between these two concepts, we aim to provide a more nuanced\nanalysis of how leaders consolidate and maintain their positions. While power\nexpansion and extension can often occur simultaneously, differentiating between\nthem allows for a more precise examination of the strategies employed by leaders\nto entrench their rule.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for our study as it enables us to: 1. Analyze the\ndifferent mechanisms leaders use to solidify their power 2. Examine the potential\nconsequences of each type of power consolidation 3. Explore the relationship\nbetween power expansion and extension in various political contexts\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is essential for comprehending the complex dynamics\nof political power and leadership longevity in both democratic and authoritarian\nsystems.\"\n\n### Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\n\nThe concept of autocoups, or the illegitimate seizure of power by incumbent\nleaders, remains a complex and contested area of study. Unlike coups, which are\ngenerally understood as illegal attempts by elites to overthrow the government,\nautocoups lack a clear and consistent definition. This ambiguity hinders our\nability to accurately identify, analyze, and compare instances of this\nphenomenon.\n\n#### Terminology\n\nThe most common term in autocoup literature is \"self-coup,\" or \"autogolpe\" in\nSpanish [@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017;\n@marsteintredet2019]. This term gained academic prominence after Peruvian\nPresident Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the\nconstitution, and ruled by decree in 1992 [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998]. However,\nas @marsteintredet2019 point out, the term \"self-coup\" can be misleading, as it\nimplies a coup against oneself, which is inaccurate since it targets other state\ninstitutions or apparatus.\n\nAnother approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use terms with\nadjectives or modifiers, such as \"presidential coup,\" \"executive coup,\"\n\"constitutional coup,\" \"electoral coup,\" \"judicial coup,\" \"slow-motion coup,\"\n\"soft coup,\" and \"parliamentary coup\" [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms\ncan be helpful in specific contexts, their proliferation often adds to the\noverall confusion rather than providing clarification. Most of these terms focus\non the specific methods used by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify\nthe perpetrator, necessitating further explanation. In fact, many of these\nmethods could be employed either by or against executive leaders.\n\nA third alternative involves terms like \"incumbent takeover,\" \"executive\ntakeover,\" or \"overstay.\" Incumbent takeover refers to \"an event perpetuated by a\nruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or informal\nconstraints on his/her power\" [@baturo2022, p.374], based on earlier research\n[@svolik2014]. Meanwhile, overstay is defined as \"staying longer than the maximum\nterm as it stood when the candidate originally came into office\"\n[@ginsburg2011evasion, p.1844]. These terms identify the perpetrator (the\nincumbent) and/or the nature of the event (overstaying/extending power). However,\nthey do not highlight the illegality or illegitimacy of these actions. Therefore,\nthey cannot serve as a direct counterpart to \"coup,\" which clearly denotes the\nillegality of leadership ousters, while \"takeover\" or \"overstay\" diminish the\nseverity.\n\nAs these terms often lack precision, focusing on specific methods rather than the\ncore act of power usurpation, this study proposes \"autocoup\" as the most suitable\nterm for this phenomenon. Unlike other terms, 'autocoup' clearly identifies the\nperpetrator and the illegitimate nature of the power grab, distinguishing it from\ntraditional coups.\n\n#### Definition\n\nWhile terminology is important, another issue arises with the previous definition\nof autocoups: What is the emphasis of an autocoup—power expansion, power\nextension, or both?\n\nDefinitions of power expansion and power extension in political science can often\nbe ambiguous or overlapping. To ensure clarity in the study of autocoups, I\npropose distinct definitions for these concepts:\n\n-   **Power Expansion:** This refers to the process by which an incumbent leader\n    acquires additional authority or control over state apparatuses beyond their\n    original mandate. This may involve centralizing power, reducing checks and\n    balances, or encroaching on the authority of other branches like the\n    legislature or judiciary.\n\n-   **Power Extension:** This describes situations where a leader prolongs their\n    tenure beyond the originally mandated term in office, often through\n    constitutional amendments, cancellation of elections, or other means of\n    circumventing term limits.\n\nExisting definitions of autocoups or related concepts often either are ambiguous\nbetween power expansion and extension, or focus more on power expansion, which\nhas several drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align\nwell with the definition of a coup. The focus of a classical coup is clearly on\nthe ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or restriction on their\npower. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition of an autocoup should\nprioritize the tenure extension of executive leadership. Power restriction on\nincumbents would not be coded as a coup as long as they remain in office.\nSimilarly, an executive leader acquiring more power from other branches could be\ncoded as power aggrandizement, but not an autocoup, as long as they step down\nwhen their term expires.\n\nSecondly, emphasizing power expansion in autocoups often neglects the ultimate\npurpose of incumbents. It is irrational for an incumbent to expand executive\npower and then pass the powerful role to future leaders. Although the term\n\"self-coup\" gained prominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which\ninitially involved seizing power from other institutions, it is important to note\nthat Fujimori ultimately extended his term limits through constitutional\namendments. The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term,\nwhich he won with popularity in April 1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his\nsecond term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of \"authentic\ninterpretation\" which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000,\nwhich he won amid suspicions and rumors. However, he did not survive the third\nterm. In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori\nfled Peru and took refuge in Japan [@ezrow2019].\n\nThirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be\nchallenging. As @cameron1998a defined, a self-coup is \"a temporary suspension of\nthe constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who rules by\ndecree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to ratify a\npolitical system with broader executive power\" (p. 220). \"Broader executive\npower\" is difficult to define, and it would be problematic and disputable no\nmatter how it is defined.\n\nTherefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should\nprioritize power extension as the core characteristic. It is easy to identify the\nevent and the outcome in the first place. In most cases, autocoups in terms of\npower extension involve power expansions as their prerequisite and foreshadowing.\n\nBased on these criteria, I define **an autocoup as the illegitimate extension of\nan incumbent leader's term in office beyond the originally mandated limits\nthrough unconstitutional means**. This definition emphasizes the core\ncharacteristic of power extension while acknowledging the potential for power\nexpansion as a related phenomenon. Three key points need to be highlighted for\nthis definition.\n\nFirstly, this definition refers to the actual leaders of the country, regardless\nof their official titles. Typically, this would be the president; however, in\nsome cases, such as in Germany, the primary leader is the premier, as the\npresident is a nominal head of state.\n\nSecondly, while the primary characteristic of an autocoup is extending the term\nin office, this definition does not exclude instances of power expansion. Both\naspects can coexist, but the extension of the term is the central element.\n\nThirdly, autocoups, by their nature, subvert legal norms and established power\ntransfer mechanisms. No matter how legitimate they claim to be, their\nillegitimacy is not beyond a reasonable doubt as long as the incumbents are the\ndirect beneficiaries. This critical aspect will be explored further in Section 3.\n\n### Introduction to the Autocoup Dataset\n\n#### Defining the scope\n\nCategorizing political events as autocoups inevitably involves challenging\nborderline cases. To maintain consistency and avoid ambiguity, this study adopts\na broad coding approach: All instances of incumbents extending their original\nmandated term in office are coded as autocoups, regardless of the apparent\nlegality of the extension.\n\nThis approach is justified because truly legitimate amendments to power\ntransition institutions should apply only to subsequent leaders, not the\nincumbent. Even when extension procedures appear legal, the legitimacy is\nquestionable when the incumbent is the direct beneficiary.\n\n#### Classifying autocoups {#sec-classify}\n\nAutocoups manifest in various forms. I categorize them based on several key\nfactors:\n\n-   **Methods Employed**: Specific strategies used by incumbents (e.g.,\n    constitutional amendments, election cancellation).\n\n-   **Degree of Legality**: Extent of deviation from established legal norms.\n\n-   **Duration of Extension**: Length of time the incumbent remains in office\n    beyond designated term limits.\n\n-   **Outcomes**: Whether the autocoup attempt succeeds or fails.\n\nThis study primarily focuses on the methods employed, while coding for other\naspects when information is available.\n\n##### Evasion of term limits {.unnumbered}\n\nEvasion of term limits is a common tactic employed in autocoups. Incumbents often\nresort to seemingly legal manoeuvres to extend their hold on power. These\nmanoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means. The incumbents may pressure legislative bodies (congress) or\njudicial institutions (Supreme Court) to reinterpret existing term limits, amend\nthe constitution to extend terms, or even replace the constitution altogether.\nThis might also involve popular vote through referendums, or a combination of\nthese approaches. The extension can range from a single term to indefinite rule.\n\nThese manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means.\n\n-   **Changing Term Length:** Incumbents might lengthen the official term\n    duration (e.g., from 4 to 6 years) to stay in office longer, even if the\n    number of allowed terms remains unchanged. Examples, in the dataset, include\n    Presidents Dacko (CAR, 1962), Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and Pinochet (Chile,\n    1988).\n\n-   **Enabling re-election:** This approach involves incumbents modifying legal\n    or constitutional frameworks to permit themselves to run for leadership\n    again, despite initial restrictions. These restrictions might include\n    prohibitions on re-election, bans on immediate re-election, or term limits\n    that the incumbents have already reached. An illustrative example is\n    President Menem of Argentina in 1993, who leveraged this tactic to extend his\n    tenure.\n\n-   **Removing Term Limits Altogether:** This approach, as seen with President Xi\n    Jinping of China in 2018, technically allows the leader to rule for life,\n    although they may still need to participate in elections (a formality in such\n    cases).\n\n-   **Declaring** **Leader for Life:** This differs from removing term limits as\n    the leader still faces elections (although potentially rigged or\n    uncontested). An example is Indonesia's President Sukarno, who attempted to\n    declare himself president for life in 1963 (ultimately unsuccessful).\n\nThese methods are often used in combination. Initially, the duration of a term is\nextended, followed by amendments to allow re-election, then the removal of term\nlimits, and finally, the declaration of the leader for life. For example, Haitian\nPresident François Duvalier amended the constitution in 1961 to permit immediate\nre-election and then declared himself president for life in 1964.\n\n##### Election Manipulation or Rigging {.unnumbered}\n\nElection manipulation or rigging is the second most commonly used tactic to\nextend an incumbent's tenure.\n\n-   **Delaying or Removing Elections:** Delaying or removing scheduled elections\n    without legitimate justification is a frequent method used by incumbents to\n    maintain power. For instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye delayed\n    general elections until 1969 after assuming power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan\n    President José Eduardo dos Santos suspended elections throughout his rule\n    from 1979 to 2017.\n\n-   **Refusing Unfavourable Election Results:** Incumbents may refuse to accept\n    unfavourable election results and attempt to overturn them through\n    illegitimate means. For example, President Donald Trump of the United States\n    refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and tried to overturn\n    them.\n\n-   **Rigging Elections:** Winning elections with an extraordinarily high\n    percentage of votes is highly questionable. This study will code elections\n    where the incumbent wins more than 90% of the vote as autocoups. For\n    instance, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently won\n    elections with over 95% of the vote in multi-party elections since 1996,\n    indicating election rigging.\n\n-   **Excluding Opposition in Elections:** Manipulating the electoral process by\n    excluding opposition parties or candidates from participation, effectively\n    creating a one-candidate race, clearly signifies an autocoup.\n\n##### **Use of Figurehead** {.unnumbered}\n\nTo circumvent term limits, some incumbents might choose a close associate to act\nas a figurehead, taking the office publicly while the incumbent retains real\npower behind the scenes. This can be achieved through seemingly subordinate\npositions.\n\nOne example is Russia in 2008. Facing term limits, President Putin selected\nDmitry Medvedev to run for president. After the election, Medvedev appointed\nPutin as Prime Minister. However, most analysts believe Putin wielded the true\npower throughout this period.\n\n##### Reassigning supreme authority to a new role {.unnumbered}\n\nThis tactic involves an incumbent leader manipulating the constitution or legal\nframework to create a new position of power, or elevate an existing one, before\nstepping down from their current role. They then strategically take on this new\nposition, effectively retaining significant control despite appearing to\nrelinquish power. For example, in 2017, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Prime Minister\nof Turkey, spearheaded a constitutional referendum that transitioned the country\nfrom a parliamentary system to a presidential one. This new system concentrated\nsignificant executive power in the presidency. Following the referendum's\napproval, Erdoğan successfully ran for the newly established presidency,\neffectively retaining control under a different title.\n\n##### One-Time Arrangement for Current Leaders {.unnumbered}\n\nThis strategy involves special arrangements that extend the term or tenure of\ncurrent leaders without altering the underlying institutions. For example,\nLebanon extended President Émile Lahoud's term by three years in 2004 through a\none-time arrangement.\n\n#### Data Coding\n\nThe autocoup dataset is built upon existing studies and datasets, ensuring a\ncomprehensive and reliable foundation. @tbl-source outlines the main sources used\nfor coding the autocoup dataset.\n\nThe Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political Leaders' Affiliation\nDatabase (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded] provide comprehensive data on all leaders\nfrom 1875 to 2023, although our coding only includes autocoups since 1945. These\ndatasets are invaluable for identifying actual rulers, distinguishing them from\nnominal heads of state.\n\nThe Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022] integrates data from 11 related\ndatasets, offering a broad spectrum of cases where leaders significantly reduced\nconstraints on their power. This dataset includes both power expansions and\nextensions, necessitating cross-referencing with Archigos to verify\nqualifications for autocoups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-source .cell tbl-cap='Main Data Sources for Coding the Autocoup Dataset'}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}l>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 150.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}rr}\n\\toprule\nDataset & Authors & Coverage & Obervations \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nArchigos & Goemans et al (2009) & 1875-2015 & 3409 \\\\ \nPLAD & Bomprezzi et al.

The remaining\n15 events were newly\ncoded by the author through verification with other sources such as Archigos,\nPLAD and news reports.\n\nThe main deviation from the Incumbent Takeover dataset arises from excluding\npower expansions that do not involve attempts to extend tenure.\n\nThe dataset encompasses a total of 14 variables along with the *notes* field.\n\n-   **Country Identification:** Country code (*ccode*) and country name\n    (*country*) from Correlates of War project [@stinnett2002].\n\n-   **Leader Information:** Name of the de facto leader (*leader_name*,coded\n    following Archigos and PLAD datasets).\n\n-   **Timeline Variables:** Date the leader assumed power (*entry_date*), date\n    the leader left office(*exit_date*), date of the significant event marking\n    the autocoup (*autocoup_date*), and Start date of the leader's additional\n    term acquired through the autocoup (*extending_date*).\n\n-   **Power Transition Methods:** Categorical variable for how the leader entered\n    power (*entry_method*), categorical variable for how the leader exited power\n    (*exit_method*), dummy variable indicating regular (1) or irregular (0) entry\n    (*entry_regular*), and dummy variable indicating regular (1) or irregular (0)\n    exit (*exit_regular*).\n\n-   **Autocoup Details:** Key variable capturing methods used to extend power\n    (*autocoup_method*) and outcome of the autocoup attempt (*autocoup_outcome*,\n    \"fail and lose power\", \"fail but complete original tenure\", or \"successful\").\n    For successful coups, the additional term length can be calculated from the\n    difference between *exit_date* and *extending_date*.\n\n-   **Data Source:** Identifies the dataset source used for coding (*source*).\n\n-   **Additional Notes:** Provides context for exceptional cases (*notes*).\n\nThere are a few coding challenges and decisions worth mention. For cases where\nextensions happen incrementally, the *autocoup_date* reflects a significant event\nmarking the extension, such as a legislative vote or successful referendum. In\ncases where a leader undertook multiple autocoup attempts, details are recorded\nin the notes field. Care was taken to differentiate between cases of power\nexpansion and actual attempts to extend tenure, which required cross-referencing\nmultiple sources. Determining the success or failure of an autocoup attempt often\nrequired in-depth research, especially for less documented cases.\n\n#### Data descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary coding has identified 110 autocoup cases from 1945 to\n2024, involving 73 countries.

This is followed by \"removing\nterm limits altogether\" (14 cases), and then\n\"delaying elections\" and \"declaring the leader for life\" (each with\n9 cases).\n\nThe overall success rate of autocoups is 79%, which is significantly higher than\nthe approximately 50% success rate of classical coups. This high success rate can\nbe attributed to several factors:\n\n-   Incumbent Advantage: Leaders already in power have access to resources and\n    institutional mechanisms that can be leveraged to their advantage.\n\n-   Gradual Implementation: Unlike sudden coups, autocoups can be implemented\n    gradually, allowing leaders to build support and legitimacy over time.\n\n-   Legal Facade: Many autocoup methods operate within a veneer of legality,\n    making them harder to oppose openly.\n\n-   Control of State Apparatus: Incumbents often have significant control over\n    state institutions, which can be used to facilitate their autocoup attempts.\n\nHowever, success rates vary significantly across different methods.\n\n-   **100% Success Rate**: Removing term limits, delaying elections, declaring\n    the leader for life, and cancelling elections all have perfect success rates.\n    This suggests that once these processes are set in motion, they are difficult\n    to reverse.\n\n-   **Lower Success Rates:** Refusing to accept election results has the lowest\n    success rate, with only 1 out of 4 attempts succeeding. Although the sample\n    size is limited (only 4 cases in total), this trend might suggest several\n    factors at play. These include greater democratic resilience in systems where\n    general elections are regularly held, heightened international scrutiny and\n    pressure in response to blatant manipulation of election results, and\n    stronger domestic opposition to such overt power grabs.\n\n### Determinants of Autocoup Attempts: Case Studies\n\n#### High Frequency and Success Rate of Autocoups in Post-Communist Countries\n\nAnalysis of our dataset reveals a notably high frequency and success rate of\nautocoups in post-communist countries. These nations, formerly communist regimes\nprior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, have largely evolved into 'hybrid\nregimes' [@nurumov2019], with only a few retaining their communist status. The\ndata documents 12 cases of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency in these\ncountries, with only two attempts failing. Examination of these cases highlights\nseveral distinctive characteristics:\n\n-   **Inherited Authoritarian Systems**: Despite most of these 12 countries\n    transitioning from communist to non-communist governments (with the exception\n    of China), they retained many authoritarian systems from their communist\n    past.\n\n-   **Continuity of Former Elites**: The transitions did not result in the\n    removal or overthrow of previous ruling groups. Instead, former communist\n    elites often maintained their positions of power.\n\n-   **Subverted Democratic Processes**: While general elections and term limits\n    were introduced in most of these countries, the legacy of former communist\n    regimes frequently led to the circumvention of term limits and manipulation\n    of elections [@nurumov2019].\n\n##### Case 1: Lifelong Ruler–Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus {.unnumbered}\n\nAlexander Lukashenko, a former member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian\nSoviet Socialist Republic, became the head of the interim anti-corruption\ncommittee of the Supreme Council of Belarus following the dissolution of the\nSoviet Union. Elected as Belarus's first president in 1994, he has maintained\nthis position ever since. Initially, the 1994 constitution limited presidents to\ntwo successive terms. However, Lukashenko removed this restriction in 2004.\nInternational monitors have not regarded Belarusian elections as free and fair\nsince his initial victory. Despite significant protests, Lukashenko has\nconsistently claimed to win with a high vote share, often exceeding 80% in each\nelection. This pattern is evident across all five Central Asian countries of the\nformer Soviet Union, where post-dissolution leaders were typically high officials\nor heads of the former Soviet republics who continued their leadership in the\npresidency.\n\n##### Case 2: Transferring Power to a Handpicked Successor–Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan {.unnumbered}\n\nNursultan Nazarbayev served as the first president of Kazakhstan from 1991 until\n2019. Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he held de facto leadership\nas the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. Following\nindependence, he was elected as the first president and retained office until\n2019 through various means, including resetting term limits due to the\nimplementation of new constitutions. Notably, Nazarbayev did not officially\neliminate term limits but instead created an exemption for the \"First President\"\n[@nurumov2019]. Unlike Lukashenko, who remains the incumbent of Belarus,\nNazarbayev transferred the presidency to a designated successor, Kassym-Jomart\nTokayev, in 2019. However, he retained significant influence as the Chairman of\nthe Security Council of Kazakhstan until 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin America\n\nLatin America has a long-standing tradition of maintaining term limit\nconventions. Simón Bolívar, the founding father of Bolivia, was initially a\nstrong advocate for term limits, stating in 1819, \"Nothing is as dangerous as\nallowing the same citizen to remain in power for a long time... That's the origin\nof usurpation and tyranny\" [@ginsburg2019, p.38]. Although Bolívar eventually\nmodified his stance, arguing in his 1826 Constitution Assembly speech that \"a\npresident for life with the right to choose the successor is the most sublime\ninspiration for the republican order,\" term limits became a convention in Latin\nAmerica. Approximately 81% of Latin American constitutions between independence\nand 1985 imposed some form of term limits on the presidency\n[@marsteintredet2019a].\n\nAn analysis of cases in Latin American countries reveals two notable patterns.\n\n##### Often Successful at Breaking Non-re-election or Non-immediate Re-election Restrictions {.unnumbered}\n\nUnlike other presidential systems where two terms are more common,\nnon-re-election or non-immediate re-election used to be prevalent in Latin\nAmerica. According to @marsteintredet2019a, non-consecutive re-election was\nmandated in about 64.9% of all constitutions between independence and 1985, while\n5.9% banned re-election entirely.\n\nHowever, adherence to these conventions has varied across the region. Since\nMexico introduced non-re-election institutions in 1911 at the start of the\nMexican Revolution, they have remained inviolate [@klesner2019]. Similarly,\nPanama and Uruguay have never altered their re-election rules, and Costa Rica has\nonly experienced a brief period (1897-1913) permitting immediate presidential\nre-election since prohibiting it in 1859 [@marsteintredet2019a]. In many other\ncountries, however, constitutions have been frequently amended or violated.\n\nThe pursuit of re-election or consecutive re-election, therefore, has been a\nsignificant trigger for autocoups aimed at power extension in this region. Our\nresearch documents 32 autocoup cases, with over 50% (17 cases) attempting to\nenable re-election or immediate re-election, and about 59% (10 cases out of 17)\nbeing successful.\n\nUnlike those who attempt to overstay in office indefinitely, many Latin American\nleaders exit after their second term expires. Examples include President Fernando\nHenrique Cardoso of Brazil (1995-2003), President Danilo Medina of the Dominican\nRepublic (2012-2020), and President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras\n(2014-2022) [@ginsburg2019; @marsteintredet2019a; @landau2019; @baturo2019;\n@neto2019].\n\n##### Failing to Further Extend Tenure {.unnumbered}\n\nThis trend does not imply that none of these leaders attempted further\nextensions, but rather that most accepted their unsuccessful outcomes without\nabusing their power to manipulate the process. While autocoups aimed at securing\none additional term are often successful, attempts to overstay beyond this are\nfrequently unsuccessful.\n\nTwo contrasting cases illustrate the varied outcomes of term limit challenges:\n\n-   **Unsuccessful Extension – Carlos Menem (Argentina)**: President Menem\n    successfully extended his tenure by one term through a 1994 constitutional\n    amendment allowing one executive re-election. He was subsequently re-elected\n    in 1995. However, his attempt to reset his term count, arguing that his first\n    term (1988-1995) should not count as it was under previous constitutions, was\n    unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court in March 1999 [@llanos2019]. A\n    similar scenario unfolded with President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia (2002-2010)\n    [@baturo2019].\n\n-   **Successful Extension – Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua)**: In contrast, Daniel\n    Ortega, the incumbent president of Nicaragua, successfully extended his\n    presidency. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua permitted his\n    re-election in 2011. Subsequently, in 2014, the National Assembly of\n    Nicaragua approved constitutional amendments abolishing presidential term\n    limits, allowing Ortega to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. As\n    a result, he has held the presidency since 2007 [@close2019].\n\n#### As common as classical coups: Cases of African countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassical coups have been prevalent in Africa, accounting for approximately 45%\nof all global coups (219 out of 491 cases) since 1950, involving 45 out of 54\nAfrican countries (GIC dataset). While autocoups are less frequent compared to\ntraditional coups, they maintain a significant presence in Africa. Among 110\ndocumented autocoup cases globally, 46% (51 cases) occurred in Africa, involving\n36 countries. Notably, the success rate of autocoups in Africa is over 84% (43\nout of 51 attempts), which surpasses both the success rate of classical coups in\nthe region (roughly 50%) and the global average success rate of autocoups (79%).\n\nIdentifying a clear pattern of autocoups in Africa is challenging, mirroring the\ncomplexity observed with classical coups. Various factors have been proposed to\nexplain this phenomenon:\n\n-   **Natural Resources**: Countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil\n    or diamonds, may see leaders more likely to attempt and succeed in extending\n    their terms [@posner; @cheeseman2015; @cheeseman2019a].\n\n-   **Quality of Democracy**: The quality of democracy is a critical factor\n    influencing respect for term limits [@reyntjens2016].\n\n-   **International Influence**: International aid or donor influence can play a\n    significant role in discouraging attempts at power extension [@brown2001;\n    @tangri2010].\n\n-   **Organized Opposition and Party Unity**: The extent of organized opposition\n    and the president's ability to enforce unity within the ruling party are\n    crucial factors [@cheeseman2019].\n\nUtilizing the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, @cassani2020\nhighlights human rights abuses and the desire for impunity as main drivers for\nincumbents to cling to power. The more authoritarian a leader, the more likely\nthey are to attempt to break term limits and overstay in office. A leader's\nability to secure the loyalty of the armed forces through public investment\nincreases the chances of success in overstaying.\n\nDespite both coups and autocoups being prevalent, there has been a noticeable\nshift since the end of the Cold War in 1991: Traditional coups have decreased in\nfrequency while autocoups have become more prevalent.\n\nThis trend can be partially attributed to the introduction of multi-party\nelections in Africa in the 1990s, which also brought in term limits for\nexecutives [@cassani2020; @cheeseman2019]. Before 1991, personal or military rule\nwas more common, and term limits were less frequent. Post-1991, with more term\nlimits introduced, challenges to these limits have increased. However, it is\ncrucial to note that this increase in challenges does not necessarily imply that\nviolations are more common than adherence to term limits, because total power\ntransitions have increased compared to the past.\n\n### Empirical Analysis: An Example of Utilizing the Autocoup Dataset\n\nThe availability of the autocoup dataset has made it feasible to conduct\nquantitative analyses that extend beyond traditional case studies. This section\nprovides a straightforward example of how to utilize this dataset effectively. To\nanalyze the determinants of autocoup attempts, I employ a probit regression\nmodel. This approach differs from the double probit model with sample selection\nused in [Chapter @sec-chapter2] for coup attempts and success analyses. Instead,\nI use two separate probit models. Due to the high probability of success in\nautocoups, they do not exhibit the typical sample selection characteristics that\nnecessitated the use of a sample selection model in our earlier analysis of\ntraditional coups.\n\n#### Dependent Variables\n\n-   **Autocoup Attempt**: Binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt\n    occurred (1) or not (0) during the tenure of an incumbent leader.\n\n-   **Autocoup Success**: Binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt\n    was successful (1) or failed (0), conditional on an autocoup attempt\n    occurring.\n\n#### Independent Variables\n\nThe selection of independent variables are consistent with the coup analysis in\n[Chapter @sec-chapter2], plus the population size and the leader's age.\n\n-   **Population Size:** To account for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,\n    we consider the log of the population size. This transformation helps in\n    managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The\n    data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its\n    influence on power transitions. Larger populations may present more\n    governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting\n    the stability and longevity of a leader's tenure.\n\n-   **Leader's Age:** The age of the leader is included as an additional variable\n    in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with\n    leadership strength. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks,\n    and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain\n    power. This data is sourced from Archigos and PLAD datasets.\n\nUnlike the analysis of coup determinants, which could theoretically occur in any\ngiven year, I assume that an autocoup happens only once during an incumbent\nleader's tenure, as a successful autocoup negates the need for another attempt.\nHowever, this assumption does not always reflect reality, as leaders might\nattempt further extensions or try again after a failed attempt. For simplicity, I\noverlook these possibilities in our analysis.\n\nTherefore, in our probit model, the unit of analysis for autocoups is the entire\ntenure of a leader, rather than a country-year. I establish a base year for the\nvariables: for leaders who staged an autocoup, we use the year of their first\nattempt as the base year; for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, I use the\nmiddle year of their tenure as the base year.\n\n#### Results and discussions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-autocoupmodel .cell tbl-cap='Determinants of autocoup attempts and success (1945-2018)'}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{@{\\extracolsep{50pt}}lcc} \n\\\\[-1.8ex]\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n & Autocoup Attempts & Autocoup Outcome \\\\ \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & (1) & (2)\\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n Constant & $-$1.674$^{***}$ & $-$0.888 \\\\ \n  & (0.624) & (1.935) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Regime: Dominant-party & 0.070 & 0.672$^{*}$ \\\\ \n  & (0.145) & (0.402) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Military & $-$0.255 & 0.615 \\\\ \n  & (0.189) & (0.541) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist & 0.737$^{***}$ & 1.609$^{***}$ \\\\ \n  & (0.157) & (0.448) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n GDP per capita & $-$0.009 & 0.064 \\\\ \n  & (0.011) & (0.045) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Economic trend & 0.653 & 0.197 \\\\ \n  & (0.533) & (1.772) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Political stability & $-$0.044 & 0.126 \\\\ \n  & (0.036) & (0.130) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Age & $-$0.001 & 0.004 \\\\ \n  & (0.001) & (0.017) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Population(log) & $-$0.048 & 0.029 \\\\ \n  & (0.042) & (0.144) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \nObservations & 1,028 & 102 \\\\ \nLog Likelihood & $-$308.495 & $-$43.651 \\\\ \nAkaike Inf.

Among the regime types, personalist regimes\nsignificantly increase the likelihood of autocoup attempts, all else being equal.\nThis suggests that leaders in personalist regimes are more prone to attempt to\nextend their power through autocoups compared to leaders in democratic regimes\n(reference regime). Leaders in dominant-party and military regimes, however, show\nno significant difference in the likelihood of attempting an autocoup compared to\ndemocratic leaders.\n\nThe model for autocoup success (Model 2) shows similar dynamics. Personalist\nregimes again have a strong positive and significant effect on the success of\nautocoups compared to democratic leaders. Dominant-party regimes also show a\npositive and marginally significant effect. However, a detailed examination\nreveals that about half of the successful autocoups in dominant-party regimes (9\nout of 20) exhibit a personalist style, such as \"party-personal-military\"\nregimes.\n\nThis outcome is logical since personalist leaders are typically much more\npowerful than other types of leaders, making them more inclined and capable of\noverstaying in power.\n\nOther factors play an insignificant role in determining the attempts and outcomes\nof autocoups. This aligns with our conclusions on the determinants of classic\ncoups. Both coups and autocoups are significantly affected by power dynamics. As\npower transitions involve the struggle between seizing and maintaining power, the\nbalance of power status quo inevitably matters in both coups and autocoups. This\nalso explains the high success rate of autocoups. Compared to power challengers,\nincumbents are in an obviously advantageous position. Incumbent leaders can use\nstate power to their benefit, which is difficult to counteract. Even the abuse of\npower is often unchecked under a powerful leader's rule.\n\nThe empirical analysis of autocoups yields significant implications for\nreal-world politics. In particular, the high overall success rate of autocoups\nhighlights the vulnerability of democratic institutions to gradual erosion by\nincumbent leaders. The threshold for ousting or impeaching an incumbent leader\nthrough constitutional means is exceptionally high, with success often requiring\nmore than a simple majority and substantial support across various sectors.\nResorting to illegal means, such as a coup, presents even greater challenges due\nto high costs, severe consequences, and a low likelihood of success.\n\nConversely, political dynamics, whether in democracies or autocracies, tend to\nfavour incumbents even when they act unconstitutionally. Incumbents can leverage\nstate resources to achieve their political ambitions, benefiting from a high\nprobability of success and minimal consequences in case of failure. This\nasymmetry in power and risk creates a concerning scenario: for incumbents who do\nnot respect constitutional institutions, the opportunity to launch an autocoup\nappears sufficiently low-risk to warrant an attempt.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of autocoups, focusing\nspecifically on political events where incumbent leaders illegitimately extend\ntheir tenure in power. By refining the concept and distinguishing it from broader\ndefinitions such as 'self-coups', 'autogolpes', and 'executive takeovers', I\nintroduce a novel dataset of autocoups spanning from 1945 to 2024. Through this\nmore precise definition and dataset, this research expands the analysis of\nirregular power dynamics from irregular transition to irregular retention,\noffering a broader and more nuanced review of the phenomenon.\n\nThe findings reveal that personalist regimes are significantly more likely to\nexperience autocoup attempts and succeed in these attempts compared to\ndemocracies. Dominant-party systems, often exhibiting personalist\ncharacteristics, also show an association with successful autocoups. While regime\ntype significantly influences autocoups, other factors appear less impactful,\nmirroring classic coups where the balance of power is a more essential\ndeterminant. The high success rate of autocoups can be attributed to the inherent\nadvantages incumbents possess, such as control over or abuse of state power and\nthe difficulty of removing or impeaching them through legal or illegal means.\n\nHowever, several limitations warrant consideration for future research. Firstly,\nthe definition of an autocoup requires further commentary and discussion to gain\nwider acceptance in the academic community. Despite efforts to maintain\nobjectivity, some coding decisions may involve subjective judgements,\nparticularly in borderline cases. Secondly, due to the nature of autocoups, which\nare less frequent than classic coups (491 coups versus 110 autocoups during the\nsame period), the quantitative analysis cannot be conducted as a country-year\nvariable as in coup studies. This raises the issue of choosing an appropriate\nbase year. For instance, when analysing how GDP level or growth rate, political\nstability, or the age of the leader affects autocoup attempts, we must decide\nwhich year's value should be used. In this study, I chose the middle year of a\nleader's tenure or the year they staged the autocoup, but determining the most\nappropriate year requires further discussion and potentially sensitivity\nanalyses.\n\nDespite these limitations, this research significantly enhances our understanding\nof the mechanisms and motivations behind autocoups, contributing to the\nliterature on political stability and democratic resilience. The findings\nhighlight the vulnerability of political systems, particularly democracies, to\nerosion from within by incumbent leaders.\n\nFuture studies could build on this work by employing the dataset to explore more\nnuanced power dynamics or examine the long-term impacts of these events on\npolitical systems. Particularly fruitful areas for investigation include the\nrelationship between autocoups and democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown,\nand the personalization of power. Additionally, comparative analyses between\nautocoups and traditional coups could yield insights into the evolving nature of\npower consolidation strategies in different political contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, this study not only provides a valuable resource for future\nresearch but also contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay\nbetween leadership, institutional structures, and political stability. As\nautocratic tendencies continue to challenge democratic norms globally, the\ninsights gained from this analysis of autocoups become increasingly relevant for\nboth scholars and policy-makers concerned with preserving and strengthening\ndemocratic institutions.\n\n## Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival: A Comparative Analysis of Coup-Entry and Autocoup Leaders\n\n### Abstract {.unnumbered}\n\nThis chapter examines the relationship between methods of power acquisition and\nthe longevity of leaders who assume power through irregular means, specifically\ncoup-entry and autocoup leaders. The central hypothesis posits that the mode of\naccession significantly influences leader tenure. Employing Cox proportional\nhazards and time-dependent Cox models, this study provides robust evidence of\ndivergent survival times between these two leader types. Findings reveal that\ncoup-entry leaders face a substantially higher risk of removal from office\ncompared to their autocoup counterparts. These results have significant\nimplications for political stability and democratic processes, suggesting that\nthe perceived low costs and high rewards associated with autocoups may\nincentivize incumbents to extend their tenure through this mechanism, potentially\ncontributing to democratic backsliding. This research makes a notable\ncontribution to the academic literature by leveraging a newly developed dataset\non autocoups. By doing so, it offers valuable insights into the dynamics of\nirregular leadership transitions and enhances our understanding of the complex\ninterplay between power acquisition methods and political longevity.\n\n***keywords**: Coups, Autocoups, Leadership Survival, Cox Model*\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe longevity of political leaders has long captivated scholars and observers.\nWhy do some rulers endure for decades while others are ousted within months or\neven days? This question has spurred extensive research in political science,\nprimarily focusing on the survival of political leaders. However, within this\nbroader framework, a specific subset of leaders—those who ascend to power through\ncoups or extend their tenure through autocoups—has received comparatively less\nattention. Examining the tenures of these leaders is crucial, as it illuminates\nthe dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and their implications for\npolitical stability and democratic processes.\n\nLeaders who attain power through conventional means often follow predictable\npatterns of ascension, tenure, and departure. In contrast, those who rise through\nirregular channels, such as coups or autocoups, present more complex and\nintriguing cases for study. Archigos dataset underscores the prevalence of such\nirregular transitions: between 1945 and 2015, over half of leaders who assumed\npower irregularly (158 out of 308) also exited irregularly. This rate\nsignificantly surpasses that of leaders who accessed office through regular\nchannels, of whom only 14.5% (213 out of 1,472) experienced irregular departures.\n\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders constitute a substantial portion of these\nirregular cases. Archigos dataset notes that of 374 leaders who exited\nirregularly, 246 (65.8%) were ousted through coups. @frantz2016 further\ndemonstrate that coup-related exits account for approximately one-third of all\nexits in autocracies, surpassing any other transition type. Additionally, the\nautocoup dataset, introduced in [Chapter 3](#sec-chapter3), documents 110\nautocoup attempts between 1945 and 2024, of which 87 were successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring the survival tenure of coup-entry and autocoup leaders presents\nchallenges due to the inherent irregularity and uncertainty of their positions.\nNevertheless, a comparative analysis reveals that leaders who extend power\nthrough autocoups tend to have longer average post-autocoup tenures\n(approximately 11 years) compared to coup-entry leaders\n(approximately 5.6 years), suggesting a potential tenure gap of over\nfive years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-logrank-1.pdf){#fig-logrank fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA preliminary log-rank test in survival analysis, as illustrated in @fig-logrank,\ndemonstrates a statistically significant difference between the tenures of\nautocoup and coup-entry leaders. The survival curve for autocoup leaders\nconsistently exceeds that of coup-entry leaders, indicating longer survival times\nand a reduced risk of ouster for autocoup leaders.\n\nThis study posits that the method of accession significantly influences\nleadership longevity. Coup-entry leaders likely confront greater challenges to\ntheir rule, resulting in shorter average tenures compared to autocoup leaders.\nThe analysis, employing Cox proportional hazards and time-dependent Cox models,\nsupports this hypothesis, demonstrating that autocoup leaders generally\nexperience longer tenures than coup-entry leaders.\n\nThis research offers two primary contributions to the field. First, it highlights\nan understudied factor in leadership survival analysis: the impact of the method\nof accession to power. My findings suggest that leader survival is influenced not\nonly by ruling strategies but also by the initial method of acquiring power.\nSecond, by employing survival models, this study provides empirical evidence of\nthe significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and coup-entry\nleaders. This insight may explain the increasing prevalence of tenure extensions\nthrough autocoups since 2000, as more incumbents observe and potentially emulate\nsuccessful precedents.\n\nThe remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Section 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Section 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyse the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Section 5 presents the analysis findings and a detailed\ndiscussion of the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes by synthesizing key\ntakeaways and exploring their broader implications for political stability and\ndemocratic processes.\n\n### Literature review\n\nThe longevity of political leaders has been a central focus in political science\nresearch for decades, driven by the wide-ranging variations observed across\nregimes, countries, and historical periods. This field encompasses two\ninterconnected aspects: regime survival and individual leader survival. Regime\nsurvival focuses on the endurance of political systems, such as monarchies,\npolitical parties, or specific ideological structures, while leader survival\nconcerns the duration of individual leaders' time in office.\n\nThese concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns. For instance, parliamentary\ndemocracies like Japan or the United Kingdom may experience prolonged periods of\nparty dominance coupled with frequent leadership changes, whereas communist\nregimes typically demonstrate enduring party rule with more frequent leadership\ntransitions. Presidential systems, such as the United States or many military\nregimes, tend to exhibit more frequent changes in both ruling party or junta and\nleader. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of individual leader\nsurvival, focusing on factors influencing the duration of leaders' time in\noffice.\n\nThe existing literature on leader survival is extensive and multifaceted. Some\nstudies explore specific mechanisms influencing leadership longevity within\nparticular regimes, such as democracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies\n[@davenport2021], while others aim to develop more generalizable theoretical\nframeworks explaining leader survival across different political systems\n[@buenodemesquita2003]. Although a universal theory remains an aspirational goal,\nthe complexities of leadership survival across diverse regime types present\nsignificant challenges.\n\nPower transition mechanisms vary substantially across different regimes,\nparticularly between democracies and autocracies. Autocratic systems often\nfeature closed leadership selection processes, restricted to a narrow pool of\nindividuals such as royal families, military elites, or ruling party members.\nWhile some autocracies may hold elections, significant barriers to entry for\nlegitimate challengers typically persist. Potential rivals may face threats like\nassassination, imprisonment, or exile. Moreover, the opacity of selection\nprocesses makes it difficult to assess genuine levels of public support compared\nto democracies. Consequently, conceptualizing selectorates or winning coalitions,\nas proposed by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes problematic in many autocratic\ncontexts.\n\nGiven these complexities, focusing research on specific regimes or leader types\nmay be more fruitful. While regular leadership changes offer valuable insights,\nthey provide limited opportunities to explore the dynamics of leader survival. In\ncontrast, the study of irregular leaders, such as those who ascend to power\nthrough coups or overstay in office through autocoups, offers a more compelling\navenue for research due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties\nsurrounding their leadership trajectories.\n\nTwo primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.\nThe first emphasizes objective factors and resources, such as personal competence\n[@yu2016], societal stability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999;\n@williams2011], natural resource endowments [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012;\n@wright2013], and external support [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017]. The\nsecond focuses on subjective factors and strategies, including political\npolicies, responses to opposition, and tactics for consolidating power\n[@gandhi2007; @morrison2009; @escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].\n\nCoups have received considerable scholarly attention, with research examining\ncoup prevention strategies, the impact of coups on leadership, and the subsequent\nactions of coup leaders. Existing research delves into strategies for thwarting\ncoups [@powell2017; @sudduth2017; @debruin2020] and how leaders extend their\ntenures after surviving coup attempts [@easton2018]. @sudduth2017 examines\npost-coup actions of dictators, focusing on purge strategies, while @sudduth2018\ninvestigates how leaders' entry methods affect their removal in dictatorships.\n\nHowever, a significant gap exists in the literature regarding the comparison of\nleadership survival between coup-entry and autocoup leaders. This study aims to\naddress this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership\nsurvival for these two leader types, contributing to a more nuanced understanding\nof political survival in irregular leadership transitions.\n\n### Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-entry leaders\n\nThe study of leadership survival in political systems presents inherent\nchallenges due to the opacity and diverse mechanisms of power transitions.\nHowever, these challenges underscore the significance of this research, as it\nilluminates understudied dynamics in political leadership. While the survival of\npolitical leaders exhibits complexity and variation, it is not entirely devoid of\npatterns. Leaders of similar types often display significant comparability.\n\n#### Key Definitions and Scope\n\nBefore delving into the comparison, it is essential to clarify several key\nterminologies:\n\n-   **Coup and Autocoup**: These terms adhere to the definitions established in\n    previous chapters.\n\n-   **Tenure Length Threshold**: To ensure meaningful analysis, this study\n    focuses on leaders with substantial periods in power, applying a six-month\n    threshold to both autocoup and coup-entry leaders.\n\n-   **Autocoup Leader**: An incumbent leader who successfully uses illegitimate\n    or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power.\n\n-   **Coup-Entry Leader**: The individual who assumes power after a successful\n    coup, regardless of their role in the coup itself.\n\nThis study focuses on comparing the post-autocoup tenure of autocoup leaders with\nthe post-coup tenure of coup-entry leaders, motivated by the relevance and\nsimilarity of these leader types in terms of illegitimacy, uncertainty, and\ninstability.\n\n#### Challenges in Power Consolidation\n\nBoth autocoup and coup-entry leaders face distinct challenges in consolidating\ntheir power, primarily due to differences in the intensity of issues related to\nillegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. This disparity creates an uneven\nplaying field in terms of power dynamics, with coup-entry leaders at a\nsignificant disadvantage. @tbl-leaders compares the main features between\nautocoup and coup-entry leaders.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-leaders .cell tbl-cap='Main features of autocoup and coup-entry leaders'}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 187.50pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 187.50pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}}\n\\toprule\nFeature & Autocoup Leader & Coup Entry Leader \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nIllegitimacy & Normally attained through\nlawful procedures, but\nlacking consensus\nlegitimacy & Blatantly illegal \\\\ \nUncertainty & Initially with some certainty, but decreases as the leader's age grows or health worsens & Significant uncertainty initially \\\\ \nInstability & Relatively stable & Unstable except when a strongman emerges or constitutional institutions are established \\\\ \nBalance of Power & Generally in a better position of power & Initially unclear and challenging to establish a balance \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##### Illegitimacy {.unnumbered}\n\nWhile both types of leaders suffer from a legitimacy deficit, the nature of this\ndeficit differs:\n\n-   **Coup-Entry Leaders**: Their illegitimacy is explicit due to the open\n    seizure of power.\n\n-   **Autocoup Leaders**: They employ a deceptive strategy, manipulating legal\n    processes to create a façade of democratic legitimacy.\n\n##### Uncertainty {.unnumbered}\n\nThe irregular paths to power create uncertainty regarding their reigns and\neventual departures. However, the levels of uncertainty differ.\n\nCoup-entry leaders face three major uncertainties: Unclear who will assume\nleadership after the coup, uncertain tenure length, and ambiguity regarding\nfuture successors.\n\nAutocoup leaders present a clearer picture: No ambiguity about who will rule\nafter an autocoup, many seek to extend their rule indefinitely or incrementally.\n\n##### Instability {.unnumbered}\n\nThe awareness of shaky legitimacy and persistent uncertainty breeds insecurity\nand a sense of crisis.\n\nCoup-entry leaders must reshape power dynamics and often purge potential\nadversaries. They need to create a new equilibrium, often disrupting established\nstructures. They also face potential backlash even from close allies and hence\nmust compromise with internal or external power challengers.\n\nAutocoup leaders encounter fewer abrupt changes in their regimes. They face less\npressure to dismantle existing ruling paradigms and have more time to implement\nchanges gradually.\n\n#### Empirical Evidence and Hypothesis\n\nEmpirical evidence supports the disadvantage faced by coup-entry leaders. Data\nreveals a correlation between the frequency of coup attempts in a country and the\nlikelihood of future coups. Over a third of coups occur in the top ten countries\nwith the most attempts since 1950 (@tbl-coups). The average survival period\nfollowing an autocoup is approximately five years longer than that of coup-entry\nleaders (@fig-logrank).\n\nThe distinct challenges faced by autocoup and coup-entry leaders in consolidating\npower create a self-perpetuating cycle that influences their tenure length.\nCoup-entry leaders, facing greater challenges, struggle to attract and retain\nstrong support, making them more vulnerable to internal and external challenges.\nConversely, autocoup leaders, often benefiting from a veneer of legitimacy and a\nstronger initial position, are better able to consolidate power and attract\nsupporters, leading to potentially longer tenures.\n\nBased on these observations, I propose the following hypothesis:\n\n***H1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups\nare more likely to survive longer compared to coup-entry leaders.***\n\n### Research Design\n\nThis study employs survival analysis to test the hypothesis that autocoup leaders\nhave longer survival times in office compared to coup-entry leaders. The research\ndesign utilizes Cox models to analyze the survival tenures of these two types of\nleaders, accounting for multiple factors that may influence their time in power.\n\n#### Methodology: Survival analysis\n\nTwo Cox models will be employed to analyze the survival tenures of coup-entry and\nautocoup leaders:\n\n-   **Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) Model**: This model uses only the variables\n    present at the entry year, without considering changes over time.\n\n-   **Time-Dependent Cox Model**: This model accounts for variations in\n    time-dependent control variables such as economic performance and political\n    stability.\n\nThe Cox model is preferred over the Kaplan-Meier model as it allows for the\nestimation of multiple factors' impacts. While it does not directly estimate the\nduration of tenure in office, it evaluates the hazard rate associated with being\nousted from power. This approach captures different facets of the same\nphenomenon: as a leader's cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their\nprobability of survival in office decreases.\n\n#### Data and Variables\n\nThe dependent variables include survival time and end point status:\n\n-   **Survival Time:** The duration of a leader's tenure, measured in days. For\n    coup-entry leaders, the survival time begins on the day they assume power\n    through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time starts on the\n    expiration date of their original legitimate term. For example, Xi Jinping\n    assumed power in 2013 and removed term limits in 2018. His original\n    legitimate tenure was set to end in 2023, so his survival time begins in\n    2023, marking the start of his post-autocoup tenure. The survival time\n    concludes on the day the leader exits office, applicable to both coup-entry\n    and autocoup leaders.\n\n-   **End point status:** This variable indicates the manner in which the\n    leader's tenure concluded, categorized as follows:\n\n    **0 = Censored:** This status is assigned to leaders who leave office through\n    regular means other than being ousted. This includes leaders transferring\n    power to their designated successors, leaving office as their terms expire,\n    losing in general elections, voluntarily leaving office due to health issues,\n    or dying of natural causes.\n\n    **1 = Ousted:** This status is assigned to leaders who are forced to leave\n    office. This includes leaders resigning under pressure, being ousted by coups\n    or other forces, or being assassinated.\n\nThe key independent variable is the leader type, which categorizes leaders into\ntwo distinct groups:\n\n-   **Group A = Autocoup Leader**: Leaders who extend their tenure through\n    autocoups.\n-   **Group B = Coup-Entry Leader**: Leaders who assume power through coups.\n\nThis variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the\nbasis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.\n\nThe data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from the\nautocoup dataset introduced in this study, Archigos, and PLAD.\n\nControl variables include economic performance, political stability, population\nsize, and the leader's age, which are consistent with the autocoup analysis in\n[Chapter @sec-chapter3].\n\n### Results and discussion\n\n#### Model results\n\nUsing the `survival` package in R [@survival], I present the regression results\nfor both the Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model and the time-dependent Cox\nmodel in @tbl-cox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-cox .cell tbl-cap='Cox models for survival time of different types of leaders'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{lcccccccc}\n\\toprule\n & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Cox PH Model}} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Time-dependent Cox Model}} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule(lr){2-5} \\cmidrule(lr){6-9}\n\\textbf{Characteristic} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n{\\bfseries Leader Type} &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\\\ \n    Autocoup leaders & 76 & 31 & 1.00 & — & 737 & 29 & 1.00 & — \\\\ \n    Coup-entry leaders & 148 & 73 & 2.71*** & 0.252 & 853 & 73 & 2.23*** & 0.246 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP Growth Trend} & 224 & 104 & 1.95 & 1.08 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.20* & 0.981 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP per capita} & 224 & 104 & 0.97* & 0.020 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.95** & 0.023 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Population: log} & 224 & 104 & 0.98 & 0.083 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.90 & 0.079 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Polity 5} & 224 & 104 & 0.99 & 0.025 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.01 & 0.023 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Political stability} & 224 & 104 & 1.00 & 0.053 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.11* & 0.049 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Age} & 224 & 104 & 1.01 & 0.010 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.00 & 0.011 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}}*p\\textless{}0.1; **p\\textless{}0.05; ***p\\textless{}0.01\\\\\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}}HR = Hazard Ratio, SE = Standard Error\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the Cox PH model and the time-dependent Cox model analyses revealed a\nstatistically significant association between leadership type and the hazard of\nremoval from power. Since time-dependent Cox model use the control variables\nwhich change over time, I interpret the main findings based on time-dependent\nmodel.\n\nCoup-entry leaders were found to have a hazard ratio of 2.23 in the\ntime-dependent model compared to autocoup leaders (reference group), assuming all\nother variables in the model are held constant. This suggests that coup-entry\nleaders face a significantly greater risk of removal from power compared to\nautocoup leaders. At any given time during their tenure, coup-entry leaders are\n2.23 times more likely to be ousted from power compared to autocoup leaders, all\nelse being equal in the model.\n\nThe control variables perform differently in the two models. Economic level (GDP\nper capita) exhibits statistically significant effects in both models. In the\ntime-dependent model, the hazard ratio of 0.95 indicates that for each unit\nincrease in GDP per capita (measured in units of \\$10,000), the hazard (or risk)\nof being ousted at any given time is reduced by 5%, assuming all other variables\nin the model are held constant.\n\nGDP growth trend demonstrates a more substantial effect in reducing the risk of\ncoups. Specifically, a 1 percentage point higher economic growth trend is\nassociated with an 80% reduction in the risk of being ousted, although this\neffect is only statistically significant at the 10% level. This suggests a\npossible trend where positive economic performance might mitigate the risk of\nremoval from power, but the evidence is not robust enough to confirm this\nconclusively.\n\nPolitical stability, as measured by the violence index, shows that a 1-point\nincrease in the index correlates with an 11% higher risk of being ousted.\nHowever, this effect is also only statistically significant at the 10% level,\nindicating a weaker but potentially important relationship between increased\nviolence and the risk of removal from office.\n\n#### Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxSurv .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-1.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-2.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-2}\n:::\n\nSurvival curves for Cox Model\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survival curves depicted in @fig-coxSurv illustrate the survival rates for\nleaders of both types. Both the Cox PH model and the time-dependent Cox model\nproduce similar plots. Notably, the survival curve for coup-entry leaders\nexhibits a significantly lower trajectory compared to that of autocoup leaders.\nThe steeper drop at the early stage for coup-entry leaders indicates they are\nmore likely to be ousted shortly after assuming power. Additionally, the survival\ncurve for coup-entry leaders crosses the median survival line much earlier (about\n3,000 days) than that of autocoup leaders (about 8,500 days). This disparity\nsuggests that autocoup leaders tend to remain in power for longer durations than\ntheir coup-entry counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxHR .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-1.pdf){#fig-coxHR-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-2.pdf){#fig-coxHR-2}\n:::\n\nHazard ratios and 95% CIs for Leader Ousting\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-coxHR displays the hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals\nfor the variables incorporated in the Cox model. Both the Cox Proportional\nHazards (PH) model and the time-dependent model produce similar plots,\nreinforcing the robustness of the findings. Key points to note include:\n\n-   The closer the hazard ratio (represented by the dots) is to 1, the less\n    impact the variable has on the risk of being ousted. A hazard ratio of 1\n    indicates no effect.\n\n-   The whiskers extending from the dots represent the 95% confidence intervals.\n    If these whiskers cross the vertical blue line at 1, it indicates that the\n    variable is not statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\n-   The hazard ratio for coup-entry leaders is significantly greater than 1 and\n    statistically significant at the 5% level. This indicates that coup-entry\n    leaders face a substantially higher risk of being ousted compared to autocoup\n    leaders.\n\n-   Most other variables have hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting that a\n    one-unit increase in these variables does not significantly affect the risk\n    of being ousted.\n\n-   Although the hazard ratio for GDP growth trend is considerably less than 1 in\n    the time-dependent model, indicating a potential protective effect, it is not\n    statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it is statistically\n    significant at the 10% level, suggesting that better economic performance may\n    help to consolidate the rule of the incumbents to some extent, albeit the\n    evidence is not as strong.\n\n#### Assessing the Proportional Hazards Assumption\n\nAssessing the proportional hazards assumption is crucial for the validity of the\nCox model results. To evaluate this, we used the chi-square test based on\nSchoenfeld residuals to determine whether the covariate effects remain constant\n(proportional) over time. Although the Cox PH model violates the proportional\nhazards assumption, our primary analysis relies on the time-dependent Cox model,\nwhich does not show strong evidence of violating the proportional hazards\nassumption for any covariate. The global p-value of 0.416 is much greater than\nthe 5% significance level, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption is\nreasonably met for the time-dependent Cox model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis chapter examined the survival durations of political leaders who come to\npower through irregular means, specifically coups and autocoups. I hypothesized\nthat the mode of accession significantly influences leader tenure. Employing\nsurvival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a\ntime-dependent Cox model, I found strong evidence that autocoup leaders generally\nenjoy longer tenures than coup-entry leaders.\n\nThe findings revealed a significant difference in average tenure, with\npost-autocoup leaders averaging approximately 11 years in power compared to 5.6\nyears for coup-entry leaders. The time-dependent Cox model further indicated that\ncoup-entry leaders are 2.23 times more likely to be ousted from power at any\ngiven time compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal.\n\nThese results highlight the importance of understanding the phenomenon of\nautocoups, where leaders extend their rule by manipulating legal frameworks. Due\nto the relative ease and potential benefits of autocoups, this method of power\nretention might incentivize more leaders to employ it. Consequently, democratic\nbacksliding could become more prevalent as autocoups weaken democratic\ninstitutions and constitutional norms, particularly in nascent democracies or\nthose transitioning from autocracy.\n\nThis study contributes to the field of leadership survival by demonstrating that\nthe mode of accession significantly impacts leader tenure, a factor previously\nunder-explored in the literature. By utilizing both Cox models, the research\noffers robust analytical techniques for studying political leadership survival\nand provides strong evidence of divergent tenure lengths between these two types\nof irregular-entry leaders.\n\nHowever, limitations exist. The study relies heavily on the autocoup dataset\ncollected and coded by the author. The concept and data itself are relatively\nnovel within academia. Future research should refine and establish wider\nrecognition for the term \"autocoup,\" leading to more accurate and comprehensive\ndata collection efforts. Expanding the dataset to include more cases and\nintegrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions could yield a\nmore holistic understanding of political survival in such contexts.\n\nOverall, this chapter underscores the need for more nuanced approaches to\nstudying political tenure and the mechanisms of irregular power retention,\ncontributing valuable insights into the dynamics of political stability and the\nrisks associated with different forms of non-democratic leadership succession.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Main Findings\n\nThis study delves into the dynamics and implications of irregular power\ntransitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. The findings illuminate the complex\ninterplay between incumbents and challengers fighting for power.\n\nFirstly, our analysis reveals that the expected success rate of a coup attempt\nsignificantly influences its likelihood. This success rate is heavily influenced\nby the balance of power between the incumbent regime and challengers, which is\nlargely determined by regime type. We find that military regimes, although with\nmore control over their own military forces, face a higher risk of coups compared\nto dominant-party regimes.\n\nSecondly, the study introduces a redefined concept: the autocoup. Defined as an\nincumbent leader's refusal to relinquish power as mandated, this research\ndistinguishes autocoups from broader terms like self-coups. Based on this\ndefinition, we present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events\nfrom 1945 to 2022, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups. Case\nstudies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset's utility for quantitative\nresearch, providing a robust foundation for further analysis on autocoups.\n\nThirdly, employing survival analysis techniques, the study finds clear\ndifferences in leader longevity between those who come to power through coups and\nthose who extend their rule through autocoups. The results indicate that\ncoup-installed leaders face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to\nautocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend their rule.\n\n### Limitations and directions for future research\n\nThis study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular power transitions,\nbut some limitations require further exploration:\n\n-   **Data refinement:** Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach.\n    Future research should validate this classification system through additional\n    studies and expert evaluations.\n\n-   **Data harmonization:** The current analysis faces challenges due to\n    mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup\n    datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for\n    more robust comparisons.\n\n-   **Democratic backsliding:** While this study establishes a connection between\n    irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical\n    evidence is needed to solidify this link.\n\nSeveral avenues exist for future research:\n\n-   **Terminology and data collection:** Refining the \"autocoup\" concept and\n    achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive\n    data collection.\n\n-   **Dataset expansion:** Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and\n    integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can\n    provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.\n\n-   **Power dynamics and long-term impacts:** Utilizing this dataset, future\n    studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the\n    long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems,\n    particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization\n    of power.\n\nIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the dynamics of irregular power\ntransitions, specifically focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining\nautocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader\nlongevity, we establish a framework for understanding irregular transitions and\nleader survival. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of democratic\nresilience and political stability. Future research can build upon this\nfoundation by conducting further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup\ndataset and continuing to refine the framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: According to the Archigos dataset, \"Removed by Military, without Foreign\n    Support\" and \"Removed by Other Government Actors, without Foreign Support\" in\n    the variable exitcode are classified as coups.\n\n[^2]: The definitions and concepts of power expansion and power extension can\n    often be ambiguous.
