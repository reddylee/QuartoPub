Through\na rigorous analysis of historical data, case studies, and quantitative modeling,\nthis dissertation contributes to the broader understanding of political power\ndynamics and the intricate factors that shape leadership survival in the wake of\nirregular transitions.\n\nThe study first highlights the critical role of power dynamics, shaped by regime\ntype, in determining coup success rates and attempt frequency. Utilizing a double\nprobit model with sample selection, the research reveals that the expected\nchances of coup success significantly influence coup attempts, with military\nregimes facing heightened vulnerability due to their power structure.\n\nWhile often understudied, autocoups are shown to have a substantial impact on\ndemocratic backsliding. This research introduces a refined definition of\nautocoups alongside a novel dataset encompassing events from 1945 to 2023,\nenabling more robust quantitative analysis.\n\nEmploying survival analysis, the study compares the longevity of leaders who rise\nto power through coups versus autocoups. The findings demonstrate that\ncoup-installed leaders face significantly shorter tenures and higher risks of\nremoval. This contrasts with autocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend\ntheir rule, suggesting the potential for autocoups to motivate power grabs and\ncontribute to democratic backsliding.\n\nThis work contributes significantly to the political science literature by:\n\n-   Defining key concepts: Establishing a clear definition of autocoups, a\n    previously understudied phenomenon.\n\n-   Introducing a novel dataset: Enabling researchers to conduct more\n    comprehensive quantitative analyses of autocoups.\n\n-   Establishing a general framework: Providing a comparative approach to\n    studying both coups and autocoups, enabling analysis in a unified framework\n    for these two highly relevant political events and their potential effects on\n    democratic backsliding.\n\n***Keywords:*** Coups, Autocoups, Power transitions, Leadership survival,\nDemocratic backsliding\n\n## Introduction\n\n### Research Question and Context\n\nIrregular power transitions, characterised by a disregard for constitutional\nprocedures, represent a critical area of study in political science. These\ntransitions not only disrupt established rules but also often employ\nunconstitutional tactics to consolidate power post-transition. Moreover, such\nevents can inspire emulation among other ambitious leaders, potentially\ntriggering a cascade of similar actions across different political contexts.\n\nDespite extensive research on irregular power transitions, a fundamental question\ncontinues to challenge political scientists:\n\n**Why do some leaders face premature ousting while others extend their tenure\nbeyond constitutionally mandated limits?**\n\nThis inquiry extends to understanding the stark disparities in leadership\nlongevity, where some rulers maintain power for decades while others' tenures are\nmeasured in years, months, or even days.\n\nThis dissertation focuses on this central question, aiming to provide a\ncomprehensive analysis dedicated to understanding:\n\n-   How leaders ascend to or overstay in power through unconstitutional means.\n\n-   What factors determine the duration of a leader's rule following an irregular\n    ascent to power.\n\n### Coups and Autocoups: A Comparative Unified Framework for Irregular Power Transitions\n\nIn the study of irregular power transitions, coups have traditionally dominated\nacademic discourse due to their frequency and visibility. According to the\nArchigos dataset [@goemans2009], coups[^1] accounted for more than half of the\napproximately 145 irregular leader exits from 1945 to 2015. The Global Instances\nof Coups (GIC) dataset [@powell2011] records an even higher number, with 245\ncoup-related removals from 1950 to 2024.\n\nThe prevalence of coups has led to a well-established definition and extensive\nresearch, particularly since the turn of the millennium [@thyne2019]. This\nscholarly focus has resulted in a general consensus on the definition of coups,\nas well as the development of comprehensive datasets for quantitative analyses.\nWhile debates on the precise definition persist, most scholars, including this\nstudy, adhere to the definition proposed by @powell2011. This widely accepted\ndefinition encompasses two fundamental elements:\n\n-   **Perpetrators and Victims**: Perpetrators of coups are elites within the\n    existing power structure and the victims are incumbent executive leaders.\n\n-   **Strategy and Aim**: The primary objective is the complete removal of\n    incumbents from power.\n\nIt is important to note that this definition excludes actions that only partially\nchallenge the incumbent's authority or seek policy changes without aiming for a\ncomplete transfer of power.\n\nThe scholarly consensus on coup definition has facilitated the development of\nseveral comprehensive datasets, enabling rigorous quantitative analyses in\npolitical science research. Notable among these are: GIC Dataset, Cline Centre\nCoup d'État Project Dataset [@peyton2024], and Colpus Dataset [@chin2021]. These\ndatasets have become invaluable resources in political science, enabling\nresearchers to conduct large-scale, comparative studies on the causes, dynamics,\nand consequences of coups across different political contexts and historical\nperiods.\n\nHowever, another form of irregular power transition has been largely overlooked\nin power transition studies: leaders who refuse to relinquish power and extend\ntheir mandated terms. At least three challenges still exist in the analyses of\nthis type of irregular power transition:\n\n-   **Terminology**: Unlike the more widely accepted term \"coup,\" various terms\n    (e.g., self-coup, autogolpe, executive coup, incumbent takeover) are used to\n    describe this phenomenon.\n\n-   **Definition**: Existing definitions often conflate power expansion and power\n    extension[^2]. For instance, @cameron1998a defines an autogolpe primarily in\n    terms of power expansion, which does not align with the definition of coup.\n\n-   **Data**: A consensus dataset for autocoups is lacking, with existing\n    datasets varying in terminology, definitions, and coverage years @baturo2022.\n\nTo address this gap in the literature and provide a framework for analysis, we\npropose the term \"autocoup\" to describe this type of transition. This concept\nwill be extensively discussed and defined in Chapter 3, providing a basis for\nintegrating these events into the broader study of irregular power transitions\nand their impact on political systems and leader longevity.\n\nAnalysing coups and autocoups within a unified framework is crucial for a\ncomprehensive understanding of irregular power transitions and leader survival\nfor three reasons:\n\n-   Both phenomena significantly influence democratic backsliding and represent\n    the most frequent means of irregular power transition.\n-   Their similar nomenclature reflects a fundamental similarity: while a coup\n    aims to replace the current leader, an autocoup seeks to prevent the\n    succession of a future leader.\n-   This comparative approach will enable a more nuanced analysis of irregular\n    power transitions, contributing to our understanding of political stability,\n    democratic erosion, and leadership longevity in various regime types.\n\n### Academic Contributions\n\nThis study addresses a critical gap in the literature by offering a unified\nframework for analysing both coups and autocoups. My contributions are threefold:\n\n-   **Emphasis on Power Dynamics and Regime Types**: This study highlights the\n    significant role of power dynamics, particularly the influence of regime\n    types, in determining the success and frequency of coup attempts, underscores\n    how the expected chances of coup success motivate such attempts, with\n    military regimes being notably susceptible.\n-   **Refined Definition and Novel Dataset for Autocoups**: I introduce a refined\n    definition of autocoups, develop a novel dataset covering events from 1945 to\n    2024, and fill a significant gap in the existing literature and enable a\n    comparative analysis with classic coups.\n-   **Survival Analysis of Leaders from Different Entry Modes**: This research\n    applys survival analysis to existing coup data and the new autocoup dataset,\n    demonstrates how different modes of entry into power significantly affect\n    leader survival, and reveals that leaders who come to power through coups\n    typically have shorter tenures and face higher removal risks compared to\n    those who extend their rule through autocoups.\n\nThese contributions collectively advance the field by providing a more holistic\nunderstanding of irregular power transitions, offering new tools and data for\nquantitative analysis of autocoups, and demonstrating the interconnectedness of\npower acquisition methods and leadership survival.\n\nThis work lays the foundation for future research on the dynamics of political\npower, regime stability, and democratic backsliding, offering both theoretical\ninsights and practical implications for policy-makers and scholars alike.\n\n### Implications\n\nThe examination of irregular power transitions provides a crucial perspective on\nthe interrelated phenomena of democratic backsliding, breakdown, and autocratic\nintensification. The findings of this study provide logical explanations for\nseveral political phenomena:\n\n-   **Regression of Global Democracy Levels**: This study can explain why global\n    democracy levels have regressed to pre-2000 levels. For example, Freedom\n    House reports an 18th consecutive year of global freedom decline in 2023\n    [@freedomhouse2024freedom]. Irregular power transitions inevitably violate\n    democratic or constitutional norms and disrupt the trajectory towards stable\n    democracies or democratization from autocracies. Leaders who ascend through\n    irregular means often undermine constitutional norms to seize or overstay in\n    power, creating a vicious cycle of eroding democratic institutions.\n\n-   **Within-Regime Democratic Erosion**: This study explains why democratic\n    backsliding often occurs within regimes, with democracies becoming less\n    liberal and autocracies becoming less competitive [@mechkova2017]. This is\n    particularly because autocoups have become more prevalent than traditional\n    coups since 2000 [@bermeo2016]. Importantly, autocoups typically do not\n    result in immediate regime change, contributing to the observed pattern of\n    within-regime democratic erosion.\n\n-   **Prevalence of Autocoups Since 2000**: This research explains why autocoups\n    are more prevalent since 2000. Firstly, autocoups have a significantly higher\n    probability of success compared to traditional coups. Additionally, even when\n    unsuccessful, the repercussions of autocoups are generally less severe than\n    those of failed traditional coups. Moreover, successful autocoup leaders tend\n    to maintain power for substantially longer periods than leaders who enter\n    through traditional coups.\n\n### Overview of the Thesis\n\nThis study investigates irregular power transitions and their implications for\nleadership survival and democratic processes. I examine three key aspects:\nclassic coup attempts, autocoups, and how the method of power acquisition impacts\nleader longevity.\n\n#### Chapter 2: Determinants of Classic Coup Attempts\n\nThis chapter delves into the factors influencing classic coup attempts, with a\nnovel focus on the less observable but crucial factor of expected coup success\nrates. Key features include the utilization of a double probit model with sample\nselection and the analysis of how expected success rates significantly influence\ncoup attempts. It also examines how regime types shape the balance of power\nbetween incumbents and challengers, determining the chances of success of coups.\nFindings indicate a substantially higher coup risk in military regimes compared\nto dominant-party regimes.\n\n#### Chapter 3: Conceptualising and Analysing Autocoups\n\nThis chapter refines and analyses the concept of autocoups, with a specific focus\non power extensions by incumbent leaders. Notable elements include the\nredefinition of autocoups as instances where incumbent leaders refuse mandated\npower transitions. Introduction of a novel dataset covering autocoup events from\n1945 to 2024, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successes. Presentation of case\nstudies and empirical analyses demonstrating the utility of this dataset for more\nquantitative research in political science.\n\n#### Chapter 4: Impact of Power Acquisition Methods on Leadership Longevity\n\nThis chapter investigates how the method of power acquisition affects the tenure\nof leaders who ascend through coups versus those who extend their tenure via\nautocoups. Key aspects include hypothesis testing on the significant impact of\nthe accession method on leader tenure. Evidence of differing survival times\nbetween coup-entry and autocoup leaders, employing the Cox proportional hazards\nmodel and time-dependent Cox model. Analysis of how the risk-reward profile of\nautocoups might motivate democratic backsliding and power personalization.\n\n#### Chapter 5: Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nThe final chapter synthesizes the summary of key findings from each substantive\nchapter. Acknowledges study limitations and their potential impact on findings.\nOutlines future research directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration\nof irregular power transitions, particularly coups and autocoups.\n\n## Power Dynamics and Coup Attempts: A Selection Mechanism Analysis {#sec-chapter2}\n\n### Abstract {.unnumbered}\n\nDespite extensive research identifying around one hundred potential determinants\nof coup attempts, no consensus has been reached. This study introduces a novel\napproach that prioritizes determinants based on their impact on coup success. By\nanalysing coup success rates, the study hypothesizes that the expected outcomes\nof coups are critical determinants of their occurrence. Utilizing a double probit\nmodel with sample selection, the research investigates the relationship between\nregime types and coup attempts. The findings confirm that regime type, by shaping\ninternal power dynamics, is a crucial determinant of coup likelihood. Military\nand personalist regimes, characterized by weaker institutional frameworks and\nhigher vulnerability, demonstrate significantly higher susceptibility to coups\ncompared to dominant-party regimes.\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Introduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoups d'état, defined by @powell2011 as \"illegal and overt attempts by the\nmilitary or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting\nexecutive\" (p. 252), represent a critical challenge to political stability and\ndemocratic governance worldwide. This chapter examines the complex dynamics of\ncoup attempts, their success rates, and the factors that influence both their\noccurrence and outcomes.\n\nCoups occur with varying frequency across countries and regions. For instance: In\nLatin America, Bolivia experienced\n23 coups between 1950 and 1984,\nwhile Argentina saw 20 during\na similar period. In Africa, Sudan endured\n17 coups between 1955 and 2023.\nContrastingly, countries like Mexico (1917-2000) and South Africa (since 1950)\nhave not experienced any coups.\n\nThis variability raises a fundamental question: **Why are coups more frequent in\nsome countries than others?**\n\nDespite decades of research, political scientists have yet to reach a consensus\non the key determinants of coups. @gassebner2016 highlight this challenge, noting\nthat approximately 100 potential factors have been proposed, with their study\ntesting 66 of these across three million model permutations. This proliferation\nof variables presents a critical issue: How can we establish a framework that\nallows scholars to focus on the most relevant factors, rather than navigating an\never-expanding list of potential determinants?\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.05\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.05\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lccr}\n\\toprule\nCountry & Coup Attempted & Coup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nBolivia & 23 & 11 & 47.8\\% \\\\ \nArgentina & 20 & 7 & 35.0\\% \\\\ \nSudan & 17 & 6 & 35.3\\% \\\\ \nHaiti & 13 & 9 & 69.2\\% \\\\ \nVenezuela & 13 & 0 & 0.0\\% \\\\ \nIraq & 12 & 4 & 33.3\\% \\\\ \nSyria & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nThailand & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nEcuador & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nBurundi & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nGuatemala & 10 & 5 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 491 & 245 & 49.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GIC dataset}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nMy analysis reveals a significant oversight in previous research: the exclusive\nfocus on pre-coup conditions without adequate consideration of post-coup factors.\nThis approach has neglected a critical element in coup dynamics – the expected\nprobability of success. Key observations supporting this perspective, as shown in\n@tbl-coups, include:\n\n-   **High-stakes nature of coups**: Failed coups often result in severe\n    consequences for perpetrators, including imprisonment, exile, or death.\n\n-   **Selectivity in coup attempts**: Despite 491 coup attempts since 1950, they\n    represent only about 4% of over 12,000 country-years in the same period (GIC\n    dataset).\n\n-   **Satisfactory success rate**: Approximately half of all coup attempts\n    succeed, suggesting careful selection of opportunities by plotters.\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate clearly indicate that the\ninitiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup\noccurring depends greatly on its probability of success. However, this\nprobability is not directly observable to outsiders, including researchers, prior\nto a coup attempt.\n\nGiven the limitations in directly observing coup success probabilities, I propose\nfocusing on regime type as a crucial proxy for coup outcomes. This approach is\nbased on the following reasoning: Coup outcomes are ultimately determined by the\nbalance of power within a regime and regime types are classified based on control\nover the military, policy-making authority, and appointment of officials. By\nanalysing power dynamics across different regime types, we can gain valuable\ninsights into the structural factors shaping coup attempts and their outcomes.\n\nTo address the selection bias inherent in studying coup attempts, I employ a\ndouble probit model with sample selection. This approach allows for simultaneous\nanalysis of factors influencing both coup initiation and success.\n\nThrough this comprehensive analysis, I aim to provide a more nuanced\nunderstanding of the factors driving coup attempts and shaping their outcomes,\ncontributing to both scholarly discourse and practical efforts in two key ways:\n\n-   **Emphasis on expected chances of success**: By focusing on the probability\n    of success as a driver of coup attempts, I offer a more targeted approach to\n    understanding coup dynamics.\n\n-   **Highlighting the significance of regime type**: I demonstrate how regime\n    type influences coup likelihood, even when researchers lack perfect knowledge\n    of internal balance of power.\n\nThe remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 explores the\ndynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. Section 3 outlines the research\ndesign, methodology, and variables. Section 4 presents and discusses the\nempirical findings. Section 5 concludes with key insights and their implications\nfor understanding and potentially mitigating coup risks.\n\n### Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\n\nCoup attempts are driven by a complex interplay of factors, encompassing both the\nmotivations of potential challengers (**disposition**) and the resources and\nopportunities available to them (**capability**). This section delves into the\ndynamics of coup attempts, exploring the motivations behind them, the factors\ninfluencing their success, and the role of regime types in shaping coup\nsusceptibility.\n\n#### Motivations for coups\n\nThis section focuses on the motivations that compel actors to undertake coups,\ncategorizing them into three main types:\n\n-   **Personal Ambition:** The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth\n    serves as a significant motivator for many coup plotters. Seizing control\n    promises the ability to shape national policies, control resources, and make\n    impactful decisions without constraints. The pursuit of prestige,\n    recognition, potential economic gain, and the desire to leave a lasting\n    legacy can further incentivize individuals to undertake this risky endeavour.\n\n-   **Purported National Interest:** Coups are sometimes justified as necessary\n    interventions to address national crises, uphold the constitution, or\n    facilitate a transition to democracy. While such claims require scrutiny,\n    genuine examples exist. For instance, the 2010 coup in Niger ousted President\n    Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term by dissolving the\n    opposing court and calling a self-serving referendum [@ginsburg2019].\n\n-   **Self-Preservation:** In certain cases, coups act as pre-emptive strikes\n    against perceived threats. Coup leaders might not necessarily seek power for\n    themselves but rather fear elimination or political persecution by the\n    incumbent leaders. An example is Idi Amin's 1971 coup against Ugandan\n    President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his military command\n    position [@sudduth2017].\n\nThese motivations are often most prevalent in autocratic regimes, where\njustifications under the guise of national interest or self-preservation can mask\npersonal agendas. Stable democracies rarely face the same level of constitutional\ncrises or political persecution that might necessitate a coup. However, newly\nestablished democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and\ndemocratic backsliding, creating opportunities for coup plotters to exploit these\nweaknesses and justify their actions.\n\nDespite these potential motivations, coups remain relatively uncommon, occurring\nin only about 4% of country-years since 1950. This rarity highlights the\nimportance of capability – even the most motivated actors need the resources and\nopportunities to succeed.\n\n#### Capability for coups\n\nThe decision to attempt a coup hinges not only on motivation but also on a\ncalculated assessment of the chances of success. Several factors influence this\nassessment:\n\n-   **Military Strength**: A clear advantage in military capabilities compared to\n    the incumbent regime significantly increases the odds of a successful coup.\n\n-   **Internal Divisions within the Regime**: Existing fractures within the\n    government's power structure can be exploited by coup plotters to gain\n    support from disgruntled factions.\n\n-   **Public Support**: Widespread discontent with the incumbent regime,\n    especially within the military or key sectors of society, can create a ripe\n    environment for a successful coup.\n\n-   **Foreign Backing**: External support from powerful nations can provide\n    resources, legitimacy, and even direct military intervention to tip the\n    scales in favor of the coup plotters.\n\nWhile historical data might suggest a high success rate for coups, it's crucial\nto consider selection bias. We only observe attempted coups, not the numerous\nplots that never materialize. Analysing launched coup data alone can be\nmisleading. To understand coup attempts and their likelihood comprehensively, we\nneed a theoretical framework that accounts for this selection bias.\n\n#### Framework of coup success\n\nA frequently cited framework [@gassebner2016; @aidt2019] offers a structured\napproach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating\nthe anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of a coup can be\nrepresented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq1}\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $E(U)$**:** Expected utility or pay-off of the coup attempt\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   $B$ represents the return of a successful coup\n\n-   $C$ signifies the cost of a failed coup\n\n-   $p$ represents the probability of coup success\n\nThe condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive\n($E(U) > 0$). Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B > (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq2}\n\nThis implies that for a coup to be attempted, the expected benefits of success\nmust outweigh the expected costs of failure.\n\nQuantifying $B$ and $C$ is inherently difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or\nloved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after\na successful coup, are challenging to measure precisely.\n\nHowever, the framework's core logic remains valuable. Given the difficulty in\nprecisely quantifying $B$ and $C$, we can treat them as roughly equal. This\nallows us to shift our focus to the probability of success ($p$). The simplified\n@eq-eq2 becomes:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np > (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq3}\n\nThis suggests that a success probability greater than 50% is necessary for a coup\nto be attempted. While empirical data shows a slightly lower overall success rate\nfor coups since 1950 (49.9%, as shown in @tbl-coups), it's crucial to remember\nthat this is an average and does not reflect the specific probabilities assessed\nby coup plotters beforehand.\n\nTherefore, I can propose the first hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: The fundamental determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of\n> success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.***\n\nThis leads to the next question: What factors determine coup success and\ninfluence the decision to attempt one? The answer lies in understanding regime\ntypes and their inherent power dynamics.\n\n#### Regime types and power dynamics\n\nHistorical coup success rates do not dictate individual coup attempts. Coup\nplotters assess their chances based on their unique context. While military\nstrength is undeniably crucial, often leading to an oversimplification of coups\nas solely military events, it is vital to recognize the complex internal dynamics\nwithin the military itself [@singh2016].\n\nThe clandestine nature of coups necessitates small, secretive groups, making it\ndifficult to gauge the stance of other factions within the military. The success\nof a coup often hinges on the reactions of these other factions [@geddes1999].\n\nFurthermore, factors beyond military force, such as internal divisions within the\nruling elites, public support, and foreign backing, significantly shape the\nbalance of power.\n\nA useful framework for understanding coup susceptibility is to analyse regime\ntypes, as their classification is based on power structures [@geddes2014]. We can\ncategorize autocracies into three main types:\n\n-   **Military Regimes:** Characterized by a junta – a group of military officers\n    controlling leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include\n    regimes in Brazil (1964-1985), Argentina (1976-1983), and El Salvador\n    (1948-1984) [@geddes1999].\n\n-   **Personalist Regimes:** Power is concentrated in a single, charismatic\n    leader who controls the military, policy, and succession. Examples include\n    Rafael Trujillo's regime in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin's\n    regime in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa's regime in the Central\n    African Republic (1966-1979) [@geddes1999].\n\n-   **Dominant-Party Regimes:** Power resides within a well-organized ruling\n    party, with leaders acting as its representatives. The party structure and\n    ideology foster internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Examples include\n    the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary\n    Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European\n    countries [@geddes1999].\n\nThese regime types exhibit distinct power dynamics that influence their\nsusceptibility to coups (@tbl-regimes1):\n\n-   **Military Regimes:** Despite concentrated military control, they are\n    surprisingly unstable due to internal power struggles within the junta. The\n    lack of a clear final authority and the presence of multiple military\n    factions increase the likelihood of resorting to force to resolve disputes,\n    making these regimes the most vulnerable to coups.\n\n-   **Personalist Regimes:** Relatively stable during the leader's tenure, but\n    face a higher risk of coups due to unclear succession plans and\n    vulnerabilities associated with the leader's personal weaknesses, health, and\n    mortality.\n\n-   **Dominant-Party Regimes:** Exhibit the greatest resilience against coups due\n    to their institutionalized structures, unified leadership, clear ideology,\n    and internal discipline.\n\nEmpirical data supports this framework. While military regimes represent only\n5.6% of country-years since 1950, they experience a disproportionate share of\ncoups (over 22%). Personalist regimes, constituting 13% of country-years, account\nfor 23% of coups. Conversely, dominant-party regimes, representing 22.6% of\ncountry-years, account for only 16.7% of coups (@tbl-regimes).\n\nThis leads to our second hypothesis:\n\n> ***H2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are the most\n> prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes\n> are the least likely to experience coups among the three.***\n\n\\newpage\n\n\\blandscape\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regimes1 .cell tbl-cap='Main features of different types of regimes'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}}\n\\toprule\nRegime Type & Power Concentration & Succession & Military Alignment & Stability & Examples \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nMilitary & Junta & Unclear & May have significant influence & Low & Brazil (1964-1985), Argentina (1976-1983) \\\\ \nPersonalist & Single Leader & Unclear or dependent on leader's will & Subordinated to leader & Moderate (initially), Low (long-term) & Dominican Republic (Trujillo, 1930-1961) \\\\ \nDominant-Party & Party Leadership & Institutionalized & Aligned with the party & High & Mexico (PRI), China (CPC) \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GWF \\& Author}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regimes .cell tbl-cap='Regime types and coups since 1950'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lrrrrrr}\n\\toprule\nRegime Type & Country Year & Share & Num of Coups & Percent of Coups & Success Rate & Coup Likelihood \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nDemocracy & 5312 & 46.7\\% & 122 & 24.8\\% & 51.6\\% & 2.3\\% \\\\ \nDominant-Party & 2569 & 22.6\\% & 82 & 16.7\\% & 53.7\\% & 3.2\\% \\\\ \nPersonal & 1476 & 13.0\\% & 113 & 23.0\\% & 44.2\\% & 7.7\\% \\\\ \nMonarchy & 1056 & 9.3\\% & 25 & 5.1\\% & 56.0\\% & 2.4\\% \\\\ \nMilitary & 638 & 5.6\\% & 110 & 22.4\\% & 48.2\\% & 17.2\\% \\\\ \nOther & 322 & 2.8\\% & 39 & 7.9\\% & 53.8\\% & 12.1\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 11373 & 100.0\\% & 491 & 100.0\\% & 49.9\\% & 4.3\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\\elandscape\n\n### Research Design\n\n#### Double probit with sample selection model\n\nThis study employs a sophisticated statistical approach to account for the\nselective nature of coup attempts. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes,\nsuccess rates tend to be surprisingly consistent, hovering around 50% (as shown\nin @tbl-regimes). This suggests that coup attempts are not random acts, but\nrather strategically planned and undertaken only when the odds of success appear\nfavorable. A standard statistical model would not account for this selectivity,\npotentially leading to biased results.\n\nTo address this issue, we utilize a double probit with sample selection model,\nsimilar to the approach used by @powell2012. This model, known as a Heckman\nprobit model or bivariate probit model with sample selection, consists of two\nparts:\n\n-   **Selection Equation (Stage 1)**: This stage analyses the factors influencing\n    whether a coup attempt occurs in a particular country-year.\n\n-   **Outcome Equation (Stage 2)**: This stage focuses on the probability of\n    success for those coup attempts that actually take place.\n\nThe selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt\noccurs:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{1i}^*&=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{A} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\\\\n\\\\\ny_{1i} &= \n\\begin{cases} \n1 &\\text{if $y_{1i}^*>0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n\\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_{1i}^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup attempt is\nsuccessful, given that it occurs:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{2i}^*&=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{Z}_i \\boldsymbol{B} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\\\\n\\\\\ny_{2i} &= \n\\begin{cases} \n1 &\\text{if $y_{2i}^*>0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n\\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_{2i}^*\\le0$ (coup failes)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $y_{1i}^*$ *and* $y_{2i}^*$ are latent variables\n\n-   $\\text{Regime}_i$ is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or\n    dominant-party)\n\n-   $\\mathbf{X}_i$ and $\\mathbf{Z}_i$ are vectors of control variables\n\n-   $\\mu_{1i}$ and $\\mu_{2i}$ are error terms, assumed to follow a bivariate\n    normal distribution with correlation $\\rho$\n\nThe model assumes:\n\n$$\n\\binom{\\mu_{1 i}}{\\mu_{2 i}} \\sim N\\left(\\binom{0}{0},\\left(\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & \\rho \\\\\n\\rho & 1\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe probability equations are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP\\left(y_{1 i}=1\\right) & =\\Phi\\left(\\alpha_0+\\alpha_1 \\operatorname{Regime}_i+\\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{A}\\right) \\\\\n\\\\\nP\\left(y_{2 i}=1 \\mid y_{1 i}=1\\right) & =\\Phi\\left(\\beta_0+\\beta_1 \\operatorname{Regime}_i+\\mathbf{Z}_i \\boldsymbol{B}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard\nnormal distribution.\n\n#### Variables\n\n##### Dependent variable\n\nOur analysis utilizes data on coup attempts and outcomes from @powell2011. A\nsuccessful coup is defined as one where the incumbent leader is removed from\npower for more than seven days. The dataset covers the period from 1950 to 2023\nand includes information on 491 coup attempts, with roughly half (245) being\nsuccessful. Descriptive statistics for these coup attempts and regime types can\nbe found in @tbl-coups and @tbl-regimes.\n\n-   **Coup Attempt**: Binary variable indicating whether a coup attempt\n    occurred (1) or not (0) in a given country-year.\n\n-   **Coup Success**: Binary variable indicating whether a coup attempt was\n    successful (1) or failed (0), conditional on a coup attempt occurring.\n\n##### Key Independent Variable: Regime Type\n\nI categorize regime types following @geddes2014 (GWF), focusing on military,\npersonalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included\nfor comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in\n@tbl-regimes.\n\n##### Control variables\n\nOur control variables are chosen based on the research of @gassebner2016. They\nanalyzed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic\ngrowth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are\nparticularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance,\npolitical violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control\nvariables.\n\n-   **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an\n    indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a\n    country. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international 1000\n    dollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by @fariss2022.\n\n-   **Economic Performance:** Measured using the current-trend ($CT$) ratio\n    developed by @krishnarajan2019. This ratio compares a country's current GDP\n    per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A\n    higher $CT$ ratio indicates stronger economic performance. For a country $i$\n    at year $t$, the $CT$ ratio is calculated as follows: $$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n    \\end{aligned}\n    $$ {#eq-eq6}\n\n-   **Political Violence:** Captured by a violence index from the Major Episodes\n    of Political Violence dataset [@marshall2005current].\n\n-   **Previous coups:** Included in the selection equation as either: a) The\n    number of previous coups in a country (Model 1), or b) The time since the\n    last coup attempt (Model 2 for robustness check).\n\n### Results and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coupmodel .cell tbl-cap='Sample Selection Model of Regime Type and Coup Success, 1950-2019'}\n\n\\begingroup \n\\small \n\\begin{tabular}{@{\\extracolsep{7pt}}lcccc} \n\\\\[-1.8ex]\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Model 1} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Model 2} \\\\ \n & Coup Attempts & Coup Outcome & Coup Attempts & Coup Outcome \\\\ \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & (1) & (2) & (3) & (4)\\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n Constant & $-$1.774$^{***}$ & $-$1.803$^{***}$ & $-$1.663$^{***}$ & $-$0.654 \\\\ \n  & (0.058) & (0.360) & (0.088) & (0.518) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Regime: Democracy & 0.056 & 0.068 & 0.043 & 0.042 \\\\ \n  & (0.072) & (0.121) & (0.075) & (0.192) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Military & 0.687$^{***}$ & 0.596$^{***}$ & 0.345$^{***}$ & 0.247 \\\\ \n  & (0.084) & (0.170) & (0.091) & (0.229) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Monarchy & 0.282$^{**}$ & 0.178 & 0.233$^{*}$ & 0.088 \\\\ \n  & (0.118) & (0.201) & (0.123) & (0.310) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist & 0.319$^{***}$ & 0.128 & 0.134$^{*}$ & $-$0.145 \\\\ \n  & (0.075) & (0.170) & (0.080) & (0.205) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Economic trend & $-$0.015$^{***}$ & $-$0.004 & $-$0.014$^{***}$ & 0.009 \\\\ \n  & (0.002) & (0.007) & (0.002) & (0.008) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n GDP per capita & $-$0.028$^{***}$ & $-$0.028$^{***}$ & $-$0.016$^{***}$ & $-$0.016 \\\\ \n  & (0.003) & (0.006) & (0.003) & (0.010) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Political violence & 0.033$^{**}$ & 0.033$^{*}$ & 0.038$^{***}$ & 0.025 \\\\ \n  & (0.013) & (0.020) & (0.013) & (0.031) \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Previous coups (P) & 0.030$^{***}$ &  & 0.448$^{***}$ &  \\\\ \n  & (0.010) &  & (0.086) &  \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Yrs since coup (Y) &  &  & $-$0.018$^{***}$ &  \\\\ \n  &  &  & (0.004) &  \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n Interaction term: P * Y &  &  & $-$0.013$^{***}$ &  \\\\ \n  &  &  & (0.005) &  \\\\ \n  & & & & \\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \nObservations & 9,606 & 9,606 & 9,606 & 9,606 \\\\ \nLog Likelihood & $-$1,663.683 & $-$1,663.683 & $-$1,598.656 & $-$1,598.656 \\\\ \n$\\rho$ & 0.898$^{***}$  (0.158) & 0.898$^{***}$  (0.158) & 0.386$^{*}$  (0.234) & 0.386$^{*}$  (0.234) \\\\ \n\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n\\textit{Note:}  & \\multicolumn{4}{r}{$^{*}$p$<$0.1; $^{**}$p$<$0.05; $^{***}$p$<$0.01} \\\\ \n\\end{tabular} \n\\endgroup \n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe double probit model with sample selection, estimated using the\n***sampleSelection*** package [@sampleSelection-2] in R, provides valuable\ninsights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their outcomes across\ndifferent regime types from 1950 to 2019 (@tbl-coupmodel).

The military regime's marginal effect of 0.07 indicates that\nthe probability of coup attempts in military regimes is 7 percentage points (pp)\nhigher than in dominant-party regimes, ceteris paribus. This translates to\nmilitary regimes being about 277.7% more likely to encounter coups than\ndominant-party regimes. Similarly, personalist regimes show a 2.4 pp higher\nprobability, about 94% more likely compared to dominant-party regimes.\n\nControl variables show effects in expected directions but with weaker magnitudes.\nStronger economic performance, indicated by higher economic growth trends and GDP\nper capita levels, correlates with a lower risk of coup attempts. Political\nviolence shows a positive effect, indicating that higher levels of instability\nincrease the likelihood of coups. The positive coefficient for the number of\nprevious coups suggests a \"copycat\" effect from earlier incidents.\n\n#### Outcome Model: Coup Success\n\nThe outcome model (Columns 2 and 4 in @tbl-coupmodel) reveals determinants of\ncoup success. Military regimes demonstrate a higher probability of coup success\ncompared to dominant-party regimes, aligning with expectations that military\nregimes face higher coup risks due to their increased chances of success.\nPersonalist and monarchical regimes show slight positive effects on coup success,\nbut these effects are not statistically significant.\n\nControl variables exhibit different patterns in the outcome model compared to the\nselection model.

The observed disparity\nbetween coup attempt rates and success rates across regimes points towards\nselection bias, further validating the use of the sample selection model.\n\n#### Theoretical Implications\n\nThese results strongly support my theoretical framework, highlighting the crucial\nrole of regime structure in determining coup vulnerability. The findings\nunderscore that coups are strategic actions undertaken when odds appear\nfavourable, rather than random events.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis study addresses the lack of consensus in empirical research on coup\npredictors by introducing a novel approach that prioritizes determinants based on\ntheir impact on coup success. By analysing coup success rates, I posit that the\nexpected outcomes of coups are critical determinants of their occurrence.\nEmploying a double probit model with sample selection, the research investigates\nand confirms a strong and robust relationship between regime types and coup\nattempts.\n\nThe main findings reveal that regime type plays a pivotal role in the likelihood\nof coup attempts. Military and personalist regimes, characterized by weaker\ninstitutional frameworks and higher vulnerability, demonstrate significantly\nhigher susceptibility to coups compared to dominant-party regimes. This\nunderscores the importance of supporting initiatives that establish regimes with\nconstitutional institutions rather than those dependent on military power or\npersonal authority, as the latter prove more volatile and coup-prone.\n\nThe research also indicates that stronger economic performance, while not as\ninfluential as regime type, is associated with a lower risk of coups. This\nsuggests that policies promoting economic development can be effective in\nreducing coup risk. Given that regime type is often determined during regime\nformation and is difficult to alter, promoting economic growth might be the most\nviable coup-proofing strategy available to incumbents.\n\nHowever, these findings present a paradox for autocratic leaders, particularly\ndictators and military juntas. While institutionalization of regimes could\nenhance stability and reduce coup risk, few such leaders are willing to implement\nthese reforms. This reluctance stems from the potential constraints on their\npower or shortened terms that such changes might entail. Thus, while institutions\nmay benefit the regime's longevity, they do not necessarily serve the immediate\ninterests of individual leaders.\n\nThis study opens avenues for further research, including:\n\n-   Investigating the long-term effects of regime types on political stability,\n    including democratization or personalization.\n\n-   Examining how international factors might influence regime choices and coup\n    dynamics when internal factors are too weak to prevent coups.\n\nIn conclusion, this chapter provides robust evidence for the critical role of\nregime type in determining coup risk, while also acknowledging the complex\nrealities of political power. By illuminating the strategic calculus behind coup\nattempts, it offers valuable insights for scholars seeking to understand\npolitical instability and policymakers working to promote democratic transitions\nand political stability in diverse global contexts.\n\n## Autocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Analysis of Power Extensions by Incumbent Leaders {#sec-chapter3}\n\n### Abstract {.unnumbered}\n\nThis study aims to clarify the concept of autocoups, specifically focusing on\npower extensions by incumbent leaders. By distinguishing autocoups from the\nbroader and more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or executive takeover, which\nencompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research\nredefines the concept of autocoups. Based on this refined definition, I introduce\na novel dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2022. Using the newly compiled\ndataset, the research includes three types of case studies that provide\nqualitative insights into the dynamics of autocoups. Additionally, an empirical\nanalysis on the determinants of autocoup attempts and success is offered to\ndemonstrate how the autocoup dataset can be employed for more quantitative\nresearch. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing a\nclearer conceptual framework and a novel dataset of autocoups. It enhances our\nunderstanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by\nincumbent leaders and examines the implications for democratic backsliding,\ndemocratic breakdown, personalization, and autocratic deterioration. The insights\ngained from this study could draw more attention to the effects of autocoups on\npower transitions, political stability, and democratic resilience.\n\nkeywords: *Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership*\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe study of irregular power transitions has predominantly focused on coups due\nto their frequency and significant impact. This emphasis has led to substantial\nscholarly attention and the creation of comprehensive datasets. However, as noted\nby @gassebner2016, the multitude of potential factors proposed to explain coups\nhas often resulted in increased confusion rather than a clearer understanding of\ncoup dynamics.\n\nIn contrast, another form of irregular power transition—the incumbent leader's\nrefusal to relinquish power—has received relatively less attention despite its\nsignificance. Recent decades have witnessed a decline in traditional coups and a\nrise in this \"incumbent retention or overstay\" type of irregular power\ntransition, particularly since the end of the Cold War (@ginsburg2010evasion;\n@baturo2014; @versteeg2020law).\n\nThis chapter will redefine and clarify this type of irregular power transition,\nwhere leaders overstay their mandated term limits, as \"autocoup.\" Although\nanalyses related to autocoups are not rare, the existing literature exhibits\nseveral notable shortcomings:\n\n-   **Terminological Ambiguity:** Terms such as self-coups, autocoups,\n    autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay, and\n    continuismo are used without a clear, universally accepted definition. This\n    lack of standardization leads to confusion and inconsistent application\n    [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022].\n\n-   **Limited Data:** Due to the conceptual ambiguity surrounding autocoups, data\n    collection remains in its early stages compared to the rich datasets\n    available for traditional coups.\n\n-   **Methodological Gaps:** Research on autocoups has largely relied on case\n    studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], with few studies\n    employing quantitative analysis.\n\nMoreover, analyses of autocoups are often not integrated with those of\ntraditional coups. As a distinct category of coup, autocoups lack a corresponding\ndefinition in relation to classic coups. Consequently, traditional coups and\nautocoups are frequently analysed separately, despite their related nature, and\nthere is a paucity of comparative analyses.\n\nStudying autocoups is important for several reasons. Firstly, autocoups can\nundermine the rule of law, weaken institutions, and contribute to democratic\nbacksliding or authoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups,\nsuccessful autocoups increase the likelihood of future irregular power\ntransitions. For example, since 1945, approximately 62% of leaders who extended\ntheir terms through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either ousted or\nassassinated while in office [@baturo2019]. Thirdly, failed autocoups often lead\nto instability, inciting protests, violence, and even civil wars.\n\nThis chapter aims to address these gaps by focusing on autocoups, aiming to\nclarify terminology, refine concepts and definitions, enhance data collection,\nand explore determinants through empirical analysis, contributing in three key\nareas:\n\n-   **Conceptual Clarification:** The term \"autocoup\" will be redefined and\n    clarified, with a focus on power extension.\n\n-   **Data Collection:** A new dataset of autocoups since 1945 will be introduced\n    based on this refined definition.\n\n-   **Empirical Analysis:** Utilizing this dataset, a quantitative analysis of\n    the factors influencing leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups will be\n    conducted.\n\nThe structure of this chapter is as follows: Section 2 will review definitions\nrelated to power expansions and extensions, leading to a precise definition of\nautocoups. Section 3 will present the new autocoup dataset. Sections 4 and 5 will\nexplore the determinants of autocoup attempts through case studies and\ndemonstrate the application of the dataset in empirical analysis. The conclusion\nwill summarize key findings and suggest directions for future research.\n\n\"Definitions of power expansion and power extension in political science can\noften be ambiguous or overlapping. To ensure clarity in this study, we propose\ndistinct definitions for these concepts:\n\n-   Power Expansion: This refers to the process by which an incumbent leader\n    acquires additional authority or control over state apparatuses beyond their\n    original mandate. This may involve centralizing power, reducing checks and\n    balances, or assuming roles typically held by other branches of government.\n\n-   Power Extension: This concept specifically relates to the temporal aspect of\n    an incumbent's rule. It describes situations where a leader prolongs their\n    tenure beyond the originally mandated term in office, often through\n    constitutional amendments, cancellation of elections, or other means of\n    circumventing term limits.\n\nBy distinguishing between these two concepts, we aim to provide a more nuanced\nanalysis of how leaders consolidate and maintain their positions. While power\nexpansion and extension can often occur simultaneously, differentiating between\nthem allows for a more precise examination of the strategies employed by leaders\nto entrench their rule.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for our study as it enables us to: 1. Analyze the\ndifferent mechanisms leaders use to solidify their power 2. Examine the potential\nconsequences of each type of power consolidation 3. Explore the relationship\nbetween power expansion and extension in various political contexts\n\nUnderstanding these nuances is essential for comprehending the complex dynamics\nof political power and leadership longevity in both democratic and authoritarian\nsystems.\"\n\n### Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\n\nThe concept of autocoups, or the illegitimate seizure of power by incumbent\nleaders, remains a complex and contested area of study. Unlike coups, which are\ngenerally understood as illegal attempts by elites to overthrow the government,\nautocoups lack a clear and consistent definition. This ambiguity hinders our\nability to accurately identify, analyze, and compare instances of this\nphenomenon.\n\n#### Terminology\n\nThe most common term in autocoup literature is \"self-coup,\" or \"autogolpe\" in\nSpanish [@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017;\n@marsteintredet2019]. This term gained academic prominence after Peruvian\nPresident Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the\nconstitution, and ruled by decree in 1992 [@mauceri1995; @cameron1998]. However,\nas @marsteintredet2019 point out, the term \"self-coup\" can be misleading, as it\nimplies a coup against oneself, which is inaccurate since it targets other state\ninstitutions or apparatus.\n\nAnother approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use terms with\nadjectives or modifiers, such as \"presidential coup,\" \"executive coup,\"\n\"constitutional coup,\" \"electoral coup,\" \"judicial coup,\" \"slow-motion coup,\"\n\"soft coup,\" and \"parliamentary coup\" [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms\ncan be helpful in specific contexts, their proliferation often adds to the\noverall confusion rather than providing clarification. Most of these terms focus\non the specific methods used by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify\nthe perpetrator, necessitating further explanation. In fact, many of these\nmethods could be employed either by or against executive leaders.\n\nA third alternative involves terms like \"incumbent takeover,\" \"executive\ntakeover,\" or \"overstay.\" Incumbent takeover refers to \"an event perpetuated by a\nruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or informal\nconstraints on his/her power\" [@baturo2022, p.374], based on earlier research\n[@svolik2014]. Meanwhile, overstay is defined as \"staying longer than the maximum\nterm as it stood when the candidate originally came into office\"\n[@ginsburg2011evasion, p.1844]. These terms identify the perpetrator (the\nincumbent) and/or the nature of the event (overstaying/extending power). However,\nthey do not highlight the illegality or illegitimacy of these actions. Therefore,\nthey cannot serve as a direct counterpart to \"coup,\" which clearly denotes the\nillegality of leadership ousters, while \"takeover\" or \"overstay\" diminish the\nseverity.\n\nAs these terms often lack precision, focusing on specific methods rather than the\ncore act of power usurpation, this study proposes \"autocoup\" as the most suitable\nterm for this phenomenon. Unlike other terms, 'autocoup' clearly identifies the\nperpetrator and the illegitimate nature of the power grab, distinguishing it from\ntraditional coups.\n\n#### Definition\n\nWhile terminology is important, another issue arises with the previous definition\nof autocoups: What is the emphasis of an autocoup—power expansion, power\nextension, or both?\n\nDefinitions of power expansion and power extension in political science can often\nbe ambiguous or overlapping. To ensure clarity in the study of autocoups, I\npropose distinct definitions for these concepts:\n\n-   **Power Expansion:** This refers to the process by which an incumbent leader\n    acquires additional authority or control over state apparatuses beyond their\n    original mandate. This may involve centralizing power, reducing checks and\n    balances, or encroaching on the authority of other branches like the\n    legislature or judiciary.\n\n-   **Power Extension:** This describes situations where a leader prolongs their\n    tenure beyond the originally mandated term in office, often through\n    constitutional amendments, cancellation of elections, or other means of\n    circumventing term limits.\n\nExisting definitions of autocoups or related concepts often either are ambiguous\nbetween power expansion and extension, or focus more on power expansion, which\nhas several drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align\nwell with the definition of a coup. The focus of a classical coup is clearly on\nthe ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or restriction on their\npower. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition of an autocoup should\nprioritize the tenure extension of executive leadership. Power restriction on\nincumbents would not be coded as a coup as long as they remain in office.\nSimilarly, an executive leader acquiring more power from other branches could be\ncoded as power aggrandizement, but not an autocoup, as long as they step down\nwhen their term expires.\n\nSecondly, emphasizing power expansion in autocoups often neglects the ultimate\npurpose of incumbents. It is irrational for an incumbent to expand executive\npower and then pass the powerful role to future leaders. Although the term\n\"self-coup\" gained prominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which\ninitially involved seizing power from other institutions, it is important to note\nthat Fujimori ultimately extended his term limits through constitutional\namendments. The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term,\nwhich he won with popularity in April 1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his\nsecond term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of \"authentic\ninterpretation\" which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000,\nwhich he won amid suspicions and rumors. However, he did not survive the third\nterm. In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori\nfled Peru and took refuge in Japan [@ezrow2019].\n\nThirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be\nchallenging. As @cameron1998a defined, a self-coup is \"a temporary suspension of\nthe constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who rules by\ndecree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to ratify a\npolitical system with broader executive power\" (p. 220). \"Broader executive\npower\" is difficult to define, and it would be problematic and disputable no\nmatter how it is defined.\n\nTherefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should\nprioritize power extension as the core characteristic. It is easy to identify the\nevent and the outcome in the first place. In most cases, autocoups in terms of\npower extension involve power expansions as their prerequisite and foreshadowing.\n\nBased on these criteria, I define **an autocoup as the illegitimate extension of\nan incumbent leader's term in office beyond the originally mandated limits\nthrough unconstitutional means**. This definition emphasizes the core\ncharacteristic of power extension while acknowledging the potential for power\nexpansion as a related phenomenon. Three key points need to be highlighted for\nthis definition.\n\nFirstly, this definition refers to the actual leaders of the country, regardless\nof their official titles. Typically, this would be the president; however, in\nsome cases, such as in Germany, the primary leader is the premier, as the\npresident is a nominal head of state.\n\nSecondly, while the primary characteristic of an autocoup is extending the term\nin office, this definition does not exclude instances of power expansion. Both\naspects can coexist, but the extension of the term is the central element.\n\nThirdly, autocoups, by their nature, subvert legal norms and established power\ntransfer mechanisms. No matter how legitimate they claim to be, their\nillegitimacy is not beyond a reasonable doubt as long as the incumbents are the\ndirect beneficiaries. This critical aspect will be explored further in Section 3.\n\n### Introduction to the Autocoup Dataset\n\n#### Defining the scope\n\nCategorizing political events as autocoups inevitably involves challenging\nborderline cases. To maintain consistency and avoid ambiguity, this study adopts\na broad coding approach: All instances of incumbents extending their original\nmandated term in office are coded as autocoups, regardless of the apparent\nlegality of the extension.\n\nThis approach is justified because truly legitimate amendments to power\ntransition institutions should apply only to subsequent leaders, not the\nincumbent. Even when extension procedures appear legal, the legitimacy is\nquestionable when the incumbent is the direct beneficiary.\n\n#### Classifying autocoups {#sec-classify}\n\nAutocoups manifest in various forms. I categorize them based on several key\nfactors:\n\n-   **Methods Employed**: Specific strategies used by incumbents (e.g.,\n    constitutional amendments, election cancellation).\n\n-   **Degree of Legality**: Extent of deviation from established legal norms.\n\n-   **Duration of Extension**: Length of time the incumbent remains in office\n    beyond designated term limits.\n\n-   **Outcomes**: Whether the autocoup attempt succeeds or fails.\n\nThis study primarily focuses on the methods employed, while coding for other\naspects when information is available.\n\n##### Evasion of term limits {.unnumbered}\n\nEvasion of term limits is a common tactic employed in autocoups. Incumbents often\nresort to seemingly legal manoeuvres to extend their hold on power. These\nmanoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means. The incumbents may pressure legislative bodies (congress) or\njudicial institutions (Supreme Court) to reinterpret existing term limits, amend\nthe constitution to extend terms, or even replace the constitution altogether.\nThis might also involve popular vote through referendums, or a combination of\nthese approaches. The extension can range from a single term to indefinite rule.\n\nThese manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means.\n\n-   **Changing Term Length:** Incumbents might lengthen the official term\n    duration (e.g., from 4 to 6 years) to stay in office longer, even if the\n    number of allowed terms remains unchanged. Examples, in the dataset, include\n    Presidents Dacko (CAR, 1962), Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and Pinochet (Chile,\n    1988).\n\n-   **Enabling re-election:** This approach involves incumbents modifying legal\n    or constitutional frameworks to permit themselves to run for leadership\n    again, despite initial restrictions. These restrictions might include\n    prohibitions on re-election, bans on immediate re-election, or term limits\n    that the incumbents have already reached. An illustrative example is\n    President Menem of Argentina in 1993, who leveraged this tactic to extend his\n    tenure.\n\n-   **Removing Term Limits Altogether:** This approach, as seen with President Xi\n    Jinping of China in 2018, technically allows the leader to rule for life,\n    although they may still need to participate in elections (a formality in such\n    cases).\n\n-   **Declaring** **Leader for Life:** This differs from removing term limits as\n    the leader still faces elections (although potentially rigged or\n    uncontested). An example is Indonesia's President Sukarno, who attempted to\n    declare himself president for life in 1963 (ultimately unsuccessful).\n\nThese methods are often used in combination. Initially, the duration of a term is\nextended, followed by amendments to allow re-election, then the removal of term\nlimits, and finally, the declaration of the leader for life. For example, Haitian\nPresident François Duvalier amended the constitution in 1961 to permit immediate\nre-election and then declared himself president for life in 1964.\n\n##### Election Manipulation or Rigging {.unnumbered}\n\nElection manipulation or rigging is the second most commonly used tactic to\nextend an incumbent's tenure.\n\n-   **Delaying or Removing Elections:** Delaying or removing scheduled elections\n    without legitimate justification is a frequent method used by incumbents to\n    maintain power. For instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye delayed\n    general elections until 1969 after assuming power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan\n    President José Eduardo dos Santos suspended elections throughout his rule\n    from 1979 to 2017.\n\n-   **Refusing Unfavourable Election Results:** Incumbents may refuse to accept\n    unfavourable election results and attempt to overturn them through\n    illegitimate means. For example, President Donald Trump of the United States\n    refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and tried to overturn\n    them.\n\n-   **Rigging Elections:** Winning elections with an extraordinarily high\n    percentage of votes is highly questionable. This study will code elections\n    where the incumbent wins more than 90% of the vote as autocoups. For\n    instance, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently won\n    elections with over 95% of the vote in multi-party elections since 1996,\n    indicating election rigging.\n\n-   **Excluding Opposition in Elections:** Manipulating the electoral process by\n    excluding opposition parties or candidates from participation, effectively\n    creating a one-candidate race, clearly signifies an autocoup.\n\n##### **Use of Figurehead** {.unnumbered}\n\nTo circumvent term limits, some incumbents might choose a close associate to act\nas a figurehead, taking the office publicly while the incumbent retains real\npower behind the scenes. This can be achieved through seemingly subordinate\npositions.\n\nOne example is Russia in 2008. Facing term limits, President Putin selected\nDmitry Medvedev to run for president. After the election, Medvedev appointed\nPutin as Prime Minister. However, most analysts believe Putin wielded the true\npower throughout this period.\n\n##### Reassigning supreme authority to a new role {.unnumbered}\n\nThis tactic involves an incumbent leader manipulating the constitution or legal\nframework to create a new position of power, or elevate an existing one, before\nstepping down from their current role. They then strategically take on this new\nposition, effectively retaining significant control despite appearing to\nrelinquish power. For example, in 2017, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Prime Minister\nof Turkey, spearheaded a constitutional referendum that transitioned the country\nfrom a parliamentary system to a presidential one. This new system concentrated\nsignificant executive power in the presidency. Following the referendum's\napproval, Erdoğan successfully ran for the newly established presidency,\neffectively retaining control under a different title.\n\n##### One-Time Arrangement for Current Leaders {.unnumbered}\n\nThis strategy involves special arrangements that extend the term or tenure of\ncurrent leaders without altering the underlying institutions. For example,\nLebanon extended President Émile Lahoud's term by three years in 2004 through a\none-time arrangement.\n\n#### Data Coding\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-source .cell tbl-cap='Sources of coding autocoup dataset'}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}l>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 150.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}rr}\n\\toprule\nSource & Authors & Coverage & Obervations \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nArchigos & Goemans et al (2009) & 1875-2015 & 3409 \\\\ \nPLAD & Bomprezzi et al.

The Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political Leaders’\nAffiliation Database (PLAD) dataset [@bomprezzi2024wedded] provide comprehensive\ndata on all leaders from 1875 to 2023, although our coding only includes\nautocoups since 1945. These datasets help identify the actual rulers of\ncountries, saving time in distinguishing real leaders from nominal heads of\nstate.\n\nThe Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022], which integrates data from 11\nrelated datasets, offers a broad spectrum of cases where leaders significantly\nreduce the constraints on their power, encompassing both power expansions and\nextensions. Since some executive takeovers do not qualify as autocoups due to the\nlack of term extensions, I cross-referenced the Archigos dataset, which includes\ndetailed trajectories of leaders' entries and exits from power, to verify the\nqualifications for autocoups.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, I coded 110 observations, with\n95 overlapping with the candidate data\nfrom Incumbent Takeover. The remaining\n15 events were newly\ncoded by the author through verification with other sources such as Archigos, and\nnews reports.The main deviation from the Incumbent Takeover dataset arises from\nexcluding power expansions that do not involve attempts to extend tenure.\n\nThe main variables included in the autocoup dataset are:\n\n-   **Country Identification:**\n\n    -   `ccode` and `country`: These variables come from the Correlates of War\n        project [@stinnett2002] and identify the countries included in the\n        dataset, which are widely used in political science datasets, ensuring\n        consistency and compatibility across different studies and datasets.\n\n-   **Leader Information:**\n\n    -   `leader_name`: This variable follows the Archigos dataset's coding and\n        records the name of the de facto leader who wielded power in the country.\n\n-   **Timeline Variables:**\n\n    -   `entry_date`: Captures the date the leader assumed power.\n\n    -   `exit_date`: Records the date the leader left office.\n\n    -   `autocoup_date`: Indicates the date the autocoup is considered to have\n        occurred. Since extensions often happen incrementally, this date reflects\n        a significant event marking the extension, such as a legislative vote or\n        successful referendum.\n\n    -   `extending_date`: Represents the start date of the leader's additional\n        term acquired through the autocoup.\n\n    The `entry_date` and `exit_date` come from the Archigos and PLAD datasets,\n    while the other two dates are coded by the dataset creator.\n\n-   **Power Transition Methods:**\n\n    -   `entry_method` and `exit_method`: These categorical variables record how\n        the leader entered and exited power (e.g., election, coup, death).\n\n    -   `entry_regular` and `exit_regular`: These dummy variables indicate\n        whether the entry and exit methods were regular (e.g., election) or\n        irregular (e.g., coup).\n\n-   **Autocoup Details:**\n\n    -   `autocoup_method`: This key variable captures the various methods leaders\n        use to extend their stay in power (see @sec-classify for details).\n\n    -   `autocoup_outcome`: This variable indicates the outcome of the autocoup\n        attempt: \"fail and lose power\", \"fail but complete original tenure\", or\n        \"successful\". For successful coups, the additional term length can be\n        calculated from the difference between `exit_date` and `extending_date`.\n\n-   **Data Source:**\n\n    -   `source`: This variable identifies the dataset source used for coding,\n        primarily differentiating among \"Incumbent Takeovers\" or other sources.\n\n-   **Additional Notes:**\n\n    -   `notes`: This variable provides context for exceptional cases. For\n        instance, if a leader undertook multiple autocoup attempts, details are\n        recorded here.\n\nThe dataset encompasses a total of 14 variables along with the `notes` field.\n\n#### Data descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to our primary coding, we have identified 110 autocoup\ncases from 1945 to 2022, involving 73 countries. As shown in\n@tbl-autocoup_method, the most common autocoup method is enabling re-election,\naccounting for 46 events. This is followed\nby removing term limits altogether, with 14\ncases, and then delaying elections and declaring the leader for life, each with\n9 cases.\n\nExamining the success rates of autocoups, the total success rate is 79%, which is\nsignificantly higher than the roughly 50% success rate of classical coups. This\nsuggests that incumbents are in an advantageous position to expand or extend\ntheir powers as executive leaders. They can do so openly and gradually, whereas\ncoup plotters must operate in secrecy and face numerous challenges such as\npromissory issues and the risk of betrayal or exposure.\n\nHowever, the success rates vary significantly across different methods. Removing\nterm limits, delaying elections, declaring the leader for life, and cancelling\nelections are all 100% successful. In contrast, there are only 4 cases of\nrefusing election results, with just one succeeding. Although this sample is\nsmall, it suggests that in regimes where general elections are held and\nincumbents lose, the system is relatively more democratic. In such cases,\nincumbents must run for office without the ability to rig elections, making it\nless likely for them to overturn election results.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-autocoup_method .cell tbl-cap='Autocoup methods and success rates (1945-2021)'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 135.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 105.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 105.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}}\n\\toprule\nAutocoup Method & Autocoup Attempted & Autocoup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nEnabling re-election & 46 & 33 & 71.74\\% \\\\ \nRemoving term limits & 14 & 14 & 100.00\\% \\\\ \nDelaying elections & 9 & 9 & 100.00\\% \\\\ \nLeader for life & 9 & 9 & 100.00\\% \\\\ \nChanging term length & 7 & 5 & 71.43\\% \\\\ \nFigurehead & 6 & 5 & 83.33\\% \\\\ \nOne-time arrangement & 5 & 4 & 80.00\\% \\\\ \nRefusing election results & 4 & 1 & 25.00\\% \\\\ \nReassigning power role & 4 & 2 & 50.00\\% \\\\ \nRigging elections & 3 & 2 & 66.67\\% \\\\ \nCancelling elections & 3 & 3 & 100.00\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 110 & 87 & 79.09\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Determinants of Autocoup Attempts: Case Studies\n\n#### High Frequency and Success Rate of Autocoups in Post-Communist Countries\n\nFrom the dataset, we observe that in post-communist countries, both the frequency\nand success rate of autocoups are notably high. Post-communist countries refer to\nthose that were communist regimes before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while\nmost of them developed into 'hybrid regimes' [@nurumov2019] and only a few remain\ncommunist regimes after the collapse. In these countries, there are 12 documented\ncases of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency, with only 2 of these attempts\nfailing. Examining the cases in post-communist countries, several characteristics\nstand out:\n\n-   **Inherited Authoritarian Systems**: Although most of these countries\n    transitioned from communist regimes to non-communist governments (with the\n    exception of China), they inherited the authoritarian systems of their\n    communist past.\n\n-   **Continuity of Former Elites**: The transitions did not result in the\n    removal or overthrow of the previous ruling groups. Instead, the former\n    communist elites remained in power.\n\n-   **Subverted Democratic Processes**: Despite the introduction of general\n    elections and term limits in most of these countries, the legacy of the\n    former communist regimes often led to term limits being ignored and elections\n    being rigged [@nurumov2019].\n\nFor example, Alexander Lukashenko was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the\nByelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic before the dissolution of the Soviet\nUnion. After the dissolution, he became head of the interim anti-corruption\ncommittee of the Supreme Council of Belarus. Elected as the first president of\nBelarus in 1994, he has held the office ever since. Initially, the 1994\nconstitution set a maximum of two successive presidential terms, but Lukashenko\nremoved this limit in 2004. Furthermore, international monitors have not regarded\nBelarusian elections as free and fair, except for his initial win. Despite\nsignificant protests against him, Lukashenko claimed to win with a high vote\nshare, often exceeding 80% in each election. This pattern is evident in all five\nCentral Asian countries of the former Soviet Union. Similarly, the\npost-dissolution leaders of these countries were high officials or heads of the\nformer Soviet republics who continued their leadership in the presidency.\n\nAnother long-ruling example is Nursultan Nazarbayev, who was the first president\nof Kazakhstan from 1991 until 2019. He had been the real leader as the First\nSecretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan before the dissolution of the\nSoviet Union. After independence, he was elected as the first president and held\nthe office until 2019, through various means like resetting the term limits due\nto the implementation of new constitutions. However, he did not officially\neliminate the term limits but made an exemption for the First President,\nNazarbayev [@nurumov2019]. Unlike Lukashenko, who is still the incumbent of\nBelarus, Nazarbayev passed the presidency to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, a specially\ndesignated successor, in 2019. However, he retained significant influence as the\nChairman of the Security Council of Kazakhstan until 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin American countries\n\nLatin America has a long history of maintaining term limit conventions. Simón\nBolívar, the founding father of Bolivia, was a strong advocate for term limits,\nstating in 1819, “Nothing is as dangerous as allowing the same citizen to remain\nin power for a long time... That’s the origin of usurpation and tyranny”\n[@ginsburg2019]. Although Bolívar eventually changed his stance, arguing in his\n1826 Constitution Assembly speech that “a president for life with the right to\nchoose the successor is the most sublime inspiration for the republican order,”\nterm limits became a convention in Latin America. Approximately 81% of Latin\nAmerican constitutions between independence and 1985 imposed some form of term\nlimits on the presidency [@marsteintredet2019a].\n\nReviewing the cases in Latin American countries, we notice that:\n\n-   **Striving for Re-election:** Non-re-election or non-immediate re-election\n    has been common in Latin America, unlike other presidential countries where\n    two terms are more popular. Autocoup leaders in Latin America often attempt\n    to overstay a consecutive term.\n\n-   **Resisting long extensions:** Autocoups for one more term are often\n    successful, while attempts to overstay beyond this are frequently\n    unsuccessful.\n\nAccording to @marsteintredet2019a, non-consecutive re-election was mandated in\nabout 64.9% of all constitutions between independence and 1985, while 5.9% banned\nre-election entirely. However, adherence to these conventions has varied across\nthe region. Since Mexico introduced non-re-election institutions in 1911 at the\nstart of the Mexican Revolution, they have never been violated since then\n[@klesner2019]. Panama, along with Uruguay, has never changed the rules of\nre-election, and since Costa Rica prohibited immediate presidential re-election\nin 1859, the country has only experienced a brief period between 1897 and 1913 in\nwhich the incumbent president could be re-elected [@marsteintredet2019a]. In many\nother countries, however, constitutions have been frequently amended or violated.\nThe pursuit of re-election or consecutive re-election has been a significant\ntrigger for autocoups aimed at power extension in Latin American countries. There\nare 32 documented autocoup cases, with over 50% (17 cases) attempting to enable\nre-election.\n\nUnlike those who attempt to overstay in office indefinitely, many Latin American\nleaders exit after their second term expires. Examples include President Menem of\nArgentina (1988-1999), President Fernando Cardoso of Brazil (1995-2003),\nPresident Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic (2012-2020), and President Juan\nOrlando Hernández of Honduras (2014-2022) [@ginsburg2019; @marsteintredet2019a;\n@landau2019; @baturo2019; @neto2019]. This does not mean none of them tried to\nextend even longer, but most did not manipulate the process by abusing their\npower and accepted their unsuccessful outcomes soon.\n\nFor instance, President Menem of Argentina successfully extended one term by\namending the constitution in 1994 to allow one executive re-election and was\nre-elected in 1995. However, when he attempted to reset his term, arguing that\nhis first term from 1988 to 1995 did not count since it was under previous\nconstitutions, his appeal was unanimously ruled out by the Supreme Court in March\n1999 [@llanos2019]. A similar scenario occurred with President Álvaro Uribe of\nColombia (2002-2010) [@baturo2019]. In contrast, Daniel Ortega, the incumbent\npresident of Nicaragua, successfully extended his presidency. In 2009, the\nSupreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua allowed his re-running in 2011. In 2014,\nthe National Assembly of Nicaragua approved constitutional amendments that\nabolished term limits for the presidency, allowing Ortega to run for an unlimited\nnumber of five-year terms, making him president since 2007 [@close2019].\n\n#### As common as classical coups: Cases of African countries\n\nClassical coups have been very common in Africa, accounting for about 45% of all\ncoups (219 out of 491) globally since 1950, involving 45 out of 54 African\ncountries [@powell2011]. Autocoups, although less common compared to coups, still\nhave a significant presence in Africa. Among 113 documented autocoup cases, 46%\n(52 cases) occurred in Africa, involving 36 countries. The success rate of coups\nin Africa is roughly 50%, while the success rate of autocoups is about 83%, which\nis higher than both the success rate of coups and the average global success rate\nof autocoups, approximately 78%.\n\nIdentifying a clear pattern of autocoups in Africa is challenging, similar to the\ncase with coups. Various factors have been proposed:\n\n-   **Natural Resources**: Countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil\n    or diamonds, may see leaders more likely to attempt and succeed in extending\n    their terms [@posner; @cheeseman2015; @cheeseman2019a].\n\n-   **Quality of Democracy**: The quality of democracy is a critical factor\n    influencing respect for term limits [@reyntjens2016].\n\n-   **International Influence**: International aid or donor influence can play a\n    significant role in discouraging attempts at power extension [@brown2001;\n    @tangri2010].\n\n-   **Organized Opposition and Party Unity**: The extent of organized opposition\n    and the president's ability to enforce unity within the ruling party are\n    crucial factors [@cheeseman2019].\n\nUsing the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, @cassani2020 highlights\nhuman rights abuses and the desire for impunity as main drivers for incumbents to\ncling to power. The more authoritarian a leader, the more likely they are to\nattempt to break term limits and overstay in office. Additionally, a leader's\nability to secure the loyalty of the armed forces through public investment\nincreases the chances of success in overstaying.\n\nDespite both coups and autocoups being prevalent, there has been a noticeable\nshift since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Coups have decreased, while\nautocoups have increased. This trend is partly due to the introduction of\nmulti-party elections in Africa in the 1990s, which also brought in term limits\nfor executives [@cassani2020; @cheeseman2019]. Before 1991, personal or military\nrule was more common, and term limits were less frequent. Post-1991, with more\nterm limits introduced, challenges to these limits have increased. However, this\ndoes not imply that violations are more common than adherence to term limits.\n\n### Empirical Analysis: A Simple Example of Utilizing the Autocoup Dataset\n\nWith the availability of the autocoup dataset, we can now conduct quantitative\nanalyses that extend beyond traditional case studies. This section provides a\nstraightforward example of how to utilize this dataset effectively. To analyse\nthe determinants of autocoup attempts, we employ a probit regression model. This\nmodel is particularly appropriate for binary dependent variables, allowing us to\nestimate the probability of an autocoup attempt given a set of independent\nvariables.\n\nHowever, our approach here differs from the double probit model with sample\nselection used in Chapter 2 for coup attempts and success analyses. Instead, we\nuse two separate probit models. This methodological choice is justified by\nseveral factors specific to autocoups:\n\n-   **Incumbent Advantage**: Autocoups have a significantly higher success rate\n    compared to traditional coups, often exceeding 80%. This high probability of\n    success fundamentally alters the decision-making calculus for potential\n    perpetrators.\n\n-   **Reduced Risk**: Even in cases where autocoup attempts fail, the\n    consequences for the instigators are typically less severe than those faced\n    by leaders of failed traditional coups. This lower risk profile further\n    distinguishes autocoups from other types of coup attempts.\n\nDue to these unique features, autocoup attempts do not exhibit the typical sample\nselection characteristics that necessitated the use of a sample selection model\nin our earlier analysis of traditional coups. Given these considerations, a\nsample selection model might not be appropriate in this context. By using\nseparate probit models, we can independently examine the factors that influence\nautocoup attempts and their outcomes, without assuming a strong selection effect.\n\n#### Dependent Variable\n\n-   **Autocoup Attempts**: This binary variable indicates whether an autocoup was\n    attempted during the tenure of an incumbent leader, based on the data\n    introduced in this study.\n\n-   **Autocoup Success:** This binary variable indicates whether an attempted\n    autocoup of the incumbent leader succeeded, based on the data introduced in\n    this study.\n\n#### Independent Variables\n\n-   **Economic Performance:** This variable is measured using two indicators:\n    economic level and economic growth trend.\n\n    **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an\n    indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a\n    country.\n\n    **Economic Growth Trend:** Assessed using the current-trend (CT) ratio,\n    developed by @krishnarajan2019, which is consistent with @eq-eq6.\n\nThe GDP per capita data, expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP)\nand measured in units of \\$10,000, is sourced from the *V-Dem* dataset by\n@fariss2022. To account for the economic impact of the previous year, this data\nis lagged by one year.\n\n-   **Political Stability:** This variable captures overall regime stability by\n    including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and\n    interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the\n    Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall. This index provides\n    a comprehensive measure of the level of violence and conflict within a\n    country, which can significantly impact power transitions.\n    [@marshall2005current].\n\n-   **Degree of Democracy:** The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5\n    scores at the entry year for each respective country. These scores range from\n    -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), capturing the extent of\n    democratic versus autocratic governance. This dataset is sourced from the\n    Centre for Systemic Peace (CSP)[^3] and provides an essential measure of\n    political regime type, which might influence the political stability and\n    power transitions.\n\n-   **Population Size:** To account for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,\n    the log of the population size is considered. This transformation helps in\n    managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The\n    data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its\n    influence on power transitions. Larger populations may present more\n    governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting\n    the stability and longevity of a leader's tenure.\n\n-   **Leader's Age:** The age of the leader is included as an additional variable\n    in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with\n    leadership strength. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks,\n    and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain\n    power. This data is sourced from the leaders dataset by [@goemans2009].\n\nDifferent from analysing the determinants of coups, which theoretically could\nhappen in each year, we assume that autocoup happens only once during the tenure\nof the incumbent. Because once the incumbent succeeds an autocoup, there is no\nnecessary to stage another one. Of course, this is not the case in real time. A\nleader who successfully overstayed one term could try to overstay additional\nterm, or even strive for leadership for life. A leader who failed in the first\nattempt might make another try if they are not removed due the first failure. To\nsimplify the analysis, we overlook those possibilities.\n\nTherefore, in the *`probit`* model, the unit of analysis in autocoups is the\nwhole tenure of the leader, not country-year. So, we need to settle a base-year\nfor the variables. For leaders who staged an autocoup, we take the year of their\nfirst attempts as the base-year, while for leaders who did not attempt to\noverstay, we take the middle year of their tenure as the base-year.\n\nUnlike the analysis of coup determinants, which could theoretically occur in any\ngiven year, we assume that an autocoup happens only once during an incumbent\nleader's tenure. Once an incumbent succeeds in staging an autocoup, there is no\nneed for another attempt. However, this assumption does not always reflect\nreality. A leader who successfully extends their term might attempt further\nextensions, striving for lifelong leadership. Conversely, a leader who fails in\ntheir first attempt may try again if they are not removed from power after the\ninitial failure. For simplicity, we overlook these possibilities in our analysis.\n\nTherefore, in our *`probit`* model, the unit of analysis for autocoups is the\nentire tenure of a leader, rather than a country-year. We establish a base year\nfor the variables: for leaders who staged an autocoup, we use the year of their\nfirst attempt as the base year; for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, we\nuse the middle year of their tenure as the base year.\n\n#### Results and discussions\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-autocoupmodel .cell tbl-cap='Determinants of autocoup attempts and success (1945-2018)'}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{@{\\extracolsep{50pt}}lcc} \n\\\\[-1.8ex]\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n & Coup Attempts & Coup Outcome \\\\ \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & (1) & (2)\\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n Constant & $-$1.457$^{**}$ & $-$1.094 \\\\ \n  & (0.650) & (1.984) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Regime: Dominant-party & $-$0.594$^{***}$ & 0.501 \\\\ \n  & (0.209) & (0.494) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Military & $-$0.901$^{***}$ & 0.490 \\\\ \n  & (0.238) & (0.579) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist & 0.114 & 1.468$^{***}$ \\\\ \n  & (0.203) & (0.519) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n GDP per capita & 0.004 & 0.069 \\\\ \n  & (0.011) & (0.047) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Economic trend & 0.725 & 0.345 \\\\ \n  & (0.557) & (1.807) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Political 5 & $-$0.074$^{***}$ & $-$0.022 \\\\ \n  & (0.014) & (0.036) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Political violence & $-$0.053 & 0.114 \\\\ \n  & (0.037) & (0.131) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Age & $-$0.0004 & 0.006 \\\\ \n  & (0.001) & (0.017) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Population(log) & $-$0.041 & 0.028 \\\\ \n  & (0.046) & (0.146) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \nObservations & 970 & 102 \\\\ \nLog Likelihood & $-$288.173 & $-$43.454 \\\\ \nAkaike Inf.

Among the regime types, personalist regimes\nsignificantly increase the likelihood of autocoup attempts, all else being equal.\nThis suggests that leaders in personalist regimes are more prone to attempt to\nextend their power through autocoups compared to leaders in democratic regimes.\nLeaders in dominant-party and military regimes, however, show no significant\ndifference in the likelihood of attempting an autocoup compared to democratic\nleaders.\n\nThe model for autocoup success (Model 2) shows similar dynamics. Personalist\nregimes again have a strong positive and significant effect on the success of\nautocoups compared to democratic leaders. Dominant-party regimes also show a\npositive and marginally significant effect. However, a detailed examination\nreveals that about half of the successful autocoups in dominant-party regimes (9\nout of 20) exhibit a personalist style, such as \"party-personal-military\"\nregimes.\n\nThis is logical since personalist leaders are typically much more powerful than\nother types of leaders, making them more inclined and capable of overstaying in\npower.\n\nOther factors play an insignificant role in determining the attempts and outcomes\nof autocoups. This aligns with our conclusions on the determinants of classic\ncoups. Both coups and autocoups are significantly affected by power dynamics. As\npower transitions involve the struggle between seizing and maintaining power, the\nbalance of power status quo inevitably matters in both coups and autocoups. This\nalso explains the high success rate of autocoups. Compared to power challengers,\nincumbents are in an obviously advantageous position. Incumbent leaders can use\nstate power to their benefit, which is difficult to counteract. Even the abuse of\npower is often unchecked under a powerful leader's rule.\n\nThe threshold for removing or impeaching an incumbent leader is very high.\nWithout more than a majority or even greater support, it is very difficult to\nsucceed. Using illegal means such as a coup is even more challenging, as the\ncosts are high, the consequences are severe, and the likelihood of success is\nvery low.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of autocoups, specifically focusing\non political events where incumbent leaders illegitimately extend their tenure in\npower. By refining the concept and distinguishing it from broader definitions,\nsuch as 'self-coups', 'autogolpes', 'executive takeover', we introduce a novel\ndataset of autocoups (1945-2022). Through this more precise definition and\ndataset, we enhance the understanding and methods of analyzing the dynamics of\nirregular power transitions and the survival of political leaders.\n\nOur findings reveal that personalist regimes are far more likely to experience\nautocoup attempts and are more likely to succeed compared to democracies.\nDominant-party systems, often exhibiting personalist characteristics, also show\nan association with successful autocoups. While regime type significantly\ninfluences autocoups, other factors appear less impactful, mirroring classic\ncoups where the balance of power is a more essential determinant. The high\nsuccess rate of autocoups can be attributed to the inherent advantages incumbents\npossess, such as control over or abuse of state power and the difficulty of\nremoving or impeaching them through legal or illegal means.\n\nHowever, there are several limitations that future research could address.\nFirstly, the definition of an autocoup requires further commentary and discussion\nto gain wider acceptance. Accordingly, the dataset of autocoups requires further\ncase-by-case verification to improve accuracy, although debates on some ambiguous\ncases will likely persist. Secondly, due to the nature of autocoups, which are\nless frequent than classic coups (491 coups versus 110 autocoups during the same\nperiod), the quantitative analysis cannot be conducted as a country-year variable\nas in coups. This raises the issue of choosing a base year. For example, when\nanalysing how GDP level or growth rate, the democratic index (such as Polity 5),\nor the age of the leader affect autocoup attempts, we need to decide which year's\nvalue should be used. In this study, we chose the middle year of a leader's\ntenure or the year they staged the autocoup, but determining the most appropriate\nyear requires further discussion.\n\nDespite these limitations, this research enhances our understanding of the\nmechanisms and motivations behind autocoups, contributing to the literature on\npolitical stability and democratic resilience. Future studies could build on this\nwork by employing the dataset to explore more power dynamics or examine the\nlong-term impacts of these events on political systems, particularly on\ndemocratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, and personalization of power.\n\n## Power Acquisition and Leadership Survival: A Comparative Analysis of Coup-Entry and Autocoup Leaders\n\n### Abstract {.unnumbered}\n\nThis chapter investigates the relationship between methods of power acquisition\nand the longevity of irregular-entry political leaders, focusing on coup-entry\nand autocoup leaders. The central hypothesis posits that the mode of accession\nsignificantly influences leader tenure. Employing Cox proportional hazards and\ntime-dependent Cox models, this study provides robust evidence of divergent\nsurvival times between these two leader types. Findings reveal that coup-entry\nleaders face a substantially higher risk of removal compared to their autocoup\ncounterparts. These results have significant implications for political stability\nand democratic processes, suggesting that the relatively low costs and high\nreturns associated with autocoups may incentivise incumbents to extend their\ntenure through this mechanism, potentially contributing to democratic\nbacksliding. This research makes a notable contribution to the academic\nliterature by leveraging a newly developed dataset on autocoups. In doing so, it\noffers valuable insights into the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions\nand enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between power acquisition\nmethods and political longevity.\n\nkeywords: ***Coups, Autocoups, Survival, Political Leadership, Cox Model***\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe longevity of political leaders has long intrigued scholars and observers\nalike. Why do some rulers maintain power for decades while others fall within\nmonths or even days? This question has driven extensive research in political\nscience, focusing on the survival of political leaders. However, within this\nbroad framework, certain types of leaders—specifically those who ascend through\ncoups (coup-entry leaders) or extend tenure through autocoups—have received less\nattention. Examining the tenures of these leaders is crucial, as it illuminates\nthe dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and their impact on political\nstability and democratic processes.\n\nLeaders who assume power through regular channels often follow more predictable\npatterns of entry, tenure, and exit. In contrast, those who rise through\nirregular means, such as coups or autocoups, present more complex and compelling\ncases for study. @goemans2009 highlight the prevalence of such irregular\ntransitions: between 1945 and 2015, over half of leaders who entered power\nirregularly (158 out of 308) also exited irregularly. This rate far exceeds that\nof leaders who assumed office through regular channels, of whom only 14.5% (213\nout of 1,472) experienced irregular exits.\n\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders constitute a significant portion of these\nirregular cases. @goemans2009 note that out of 374 leaders who exited\nirregularly, 246 (65.8%) were ousted through coups. @frantz2016 further\ndemonstrate that coup-related exits account for approximately one-third of all\nexits in autocracies, surpassing any other type of transition. Additionally, the\nautocoup dataset, introduced in [Chapter 3](#sec-chapter3), documents 110\nautocoup attempts between 1945 and 2020, of which 87 were successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring the survival tenure of coup-entry and autocoup leaders presents\nchallenges due to the inherent irregularity and uncertainty of their positions.\nHowever, a comparative analysis reveals that leaders who extend power through\nautocoups tend to have longer average tenures post-autocoup (approximately\n11 years) compared to coup-entry leaders (approximately\n5.6 years). This suggests a potential tenure gap of more than 5 years\nbetween these two groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-logrank-1.pdf){#fig-logrank fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nA preliminary log-rank test in survival analysis, as illustrated in @fig-logrank,\ndemonstrates a statistically significant difference between the tenures of\nautocoup and coup-entry leaders. The survival curve for autocoup leaders\nconsistently surpasses that of coup-entry leaders, indicating longer survival\ntenures and a lower risk of ouster for autocoup leaders.\n\nI posit that the method of accession significantly influences leadership\nlongevity. Coup-entry leaders likely face greater challenges to their rule,\nresulting in shorter average tenures compared to autocoup leaders. The analysis,\nusing Cox proportional hazards and time-dependent Cox models, supports this\nhypothesis, showing that autocoup leaders generally experience longer tenures\nthan coup-entry leaders.\n\nThis study offers two key contributions to the field. First, it highlights an\nunderstudied factor in leadership survival analysis: the impact of the method of\naccession to power. Our findings suggest that leaders' survival is influenced not\nonly by their ruling strategies after taking power but also by how they initially\nacquired it. Second, by employing survival models, this research provides\nempirical evidence of the significant difference in tenure duration between\nautocoup and coup-entry leaders. This insight may help explain the increasing\nprevalence of power extensions through autocoups since 2000, as more incumbents\nobserve and potentially emulate successful precedents.\n\nThe remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Section 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Section 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Section 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a\ndetailed discussion of the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes by synthesizing\nthe key takeaways and exploring their broader implications for political\nstability and democratic processes.\n\n### Literature review\n\nPolitical survival has been a cornerstone of political science research for\ndecades, driven by the wide-ranging variations observed across regimes,\ncountries, and historical periods. This field of study encompasses two crucial\nand interconnected aspects: regime survival and individual leader survival.\n\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as\nmonarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. In contrast,\nleader survival concerns the duration of individual leaders' time in office.\nThese concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns. For instance, in parliamentary\ndemocracies like Japan or the UK, specific political parties may hold power for\nextended periods while individual leaders (Prime Ministers) change frequently.\nSimilarly, communist regimes typically see long-lasting parties in power, with\nmore frequent leadership transitions. Presidential systems like the United States\nor some military regimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling\nparty or junta and the country's leader. This study specifically investigates the\ndynamics of individual leader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how\nlong leaders remain in power.\n\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted. Some studies\nexplore specific mechanisms influencing leadership longevity within particular\nregimes, such as democracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies [@davenport2021].\nOthers aim to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks explaining leader\nsurvival across diverse political systems [@buenodemesquita2003]. While the\ndevelopment of a universal theory remains an alluring goal, it is important to\nacknowledge the inherent challenges in creating a single model that encompasses\nthe complexities of leadership survival across all regime types.\n\nPower transition mechanisms vary significantly across different regimes,\nparticularly between democracies and autocracies. In many autocratic systems,\nleadership selection is a closed affair, often restricted to a narrow pool such\nas royal families, military elites, or ruling party members. While political\ncompetition and elections may exist in some autocracies, significant barriers to\nentry for legitimate challengers often persist. Potential rivals may face threats\nsuch as assassination, imprisonment, or exile. Moreover, selection processes are\noften shrouded in secrecy, making it challenging to gauge true levels of public\nsupport compared to democracies. Consequently, calculating selectorates or\nwinning coalitions, as explored by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes nearly\nimpossible in many autocracies.\n\nGiven these complexities, focusing research on more specific regimes or types of\nleaders may be more appropriate. While regular and anticipated leadership changes\nare important, they offer less fertile ground for exploring the dynamics of\nleader longevity, as the vast majority of leaders who assume power through\nestablished channels also exit power through established mechanisms\n[@goemans2009]. In contrast, the study of political survival among irregular\nleaders is particularly captivating due to the intricacies and uncertainties\nassociated with irregular leadership transitions.\n\nTwo primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival:\n\n-   **Objective factors and resources:** This perspective considers elements such\n    as personal competence [@yu2016], societal stability [@arriola2009], economic\n    development [@palmer1999; @williams2011], access to natural resources\n    [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012; @wright2013], and external support networks\n    [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017].\n\n-   **Subjective factors and strategies:** This approach explores the strategies\n    leaders employ to consolidate their power, encompassing both the formulation\n    and implementation of political policies and leaders' responses to\n    opposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions [@gandhi2007;\n    @morrison2009; @escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].\n\nCoups have garnered significant scholarly attention due to their pivotal role in\nremoving leaders [@svolik2009; @frantz2016]. Existing research delves into\nstrategies for thwarting coups [@powell2017; @sudduth2017; @debruin2020] and how\nleaders extend their tenures after surviving coup attempts [@easton2018].\n@sudduth2017 examines post-coup actions of dictators, focusing on purge\nstrategies, while @sudduth2018 investigates how leaders' entry methods affect\ntheir removal in dictatorships.\n\nDespite the extensive research on leader survival across various contexts, a\nsignificant gap persists. There is a lack of research specifically exploring and\ncomparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their reigns through\nautocoups compared to coup-entry leaders. This study aims to address this gap by\ninvestigating and comparing the duration of leadership survival between these two\ndistinct leader types, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of political\nsurvival in irregular leadership transitions.\n\n### Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-entry leaders\n\n#### Autocoup leaders versus coup-entry leaders\n\nAs highlighted in the previous section, investigating leadership survival\npresents inherent challenges due to factors such as the opacity and diverse\nmechanisms of power transitions. However, these challenges underscore the\nsignificance of this research, as it illuminates understudied dynamics in\npolitical leadership.\n\nWhile the survival of political leaders exhibits complexity and variation, it is\nnot entirely devoid of patterns. Leaders of similar types often display\nsignificant comparability. Before delving into this comparison, it is essential\nto clarify several key terminologies.\n\nFirstly, the concepts of coup and autocoup adhere to the definitions established\nin @sec-chapter2 and @sec-chapter3 respectively. However, a significant disparity\nexists in the tenure lengths of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. Many\ncoup-entry leaders rule for only a few months or even days, while autocoup\nleaders typically enjoy longer tenures after their power grab. To ensure\nmeaningful analysis, this chpater focuses on leaders with more substantial\nperiods in power. As defined in @sec-chapter3, an autocoup is considered\nsuccessful if the power extension lasts for at least six months. For consistency\nand to allow for more robust comparison, this chapter applies the same six-month\nthreshold to both autocoup and coup-entry leaders. This approach differs from the\nseven-day duration used by @powell2011 for traditional coups, allowing us to\nexamine more established leadership periods and their associated dynamics.\n\nSecondly, it is crucial to distinguish between an autocoup leader and a\ncoup-entry leader, as leadership survival is the primary focus of this study:\n\n-   **Autocoup leader:** This refers to an incumbent leader who successfully uses\n    illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. In an\n    autocoup, the leader orchestrates the power grab and continues to rule\n    afterwards.\n\n-   **Coup-entry leader:** This term designates the individual who assumes power\n    after a successful coup. The coup leader and the coup-entry leader may or may\n    not be the same person. Unlike autocoups, coups often involve multiple\n    leaders (individuals or groups) who overthrow the incumbent leader, but\n    typically only one of them assumes supreme power. In some instances, coup\n    leaders may support someone outside the coup plot to become the new leader,\n    such as military officers returning power to civilians or supporting a new\n    general election. Regardless of the specific scenario, a coup-entry leader in\n    this study refers to the individual who assumes formal leadership following a\n    successful coup.\n\nGiven that autocoup leaders typically exhibit longer overall tenures compared to\ncoup-entry leaders, this study focuses on a more nuanced comparison.\nSpecifically, we will analyse the **post-autocoup** tenure of autocoup leaders\nand contrast it with the **post-coup** tenure of coup-entry leaders. This\nexamination is motivated by the relevance and similarity of these leader types in\nterms of illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability.\n\n#### Different challenges and tactics to consolidate power\n\nPrevious research has established that the ability to skillfully retain power is\nthe primary determinant of leader longevity. Leaders who can maintain control or\nmanipulate the balance of power tend to have longer tenures. However, coup-entry\nand autocoup leaders face distinct challenges in consolidating their power,\nprimarily due to differences in the intensity of issues related to illegitimacy,\nuncertainty, and instability. This disparity creates an uneven playing field in\nterms of power dynamics, with coup-entry leaders at a significant disadvantage.\nThe following analysis examines these challenges and their impact on leader\ntenure.\n\n##### Illegitimacy: Both coup-entry and autocoup leaders suffer from a legitimacy deficit, but the nature of this deficit differs\n\nWhile both coup-entry and autocoup leaders suffer from a legitimacy deficit, the\nnature of this deficit differs. Coup leaders openly seize power, making their\nillegitimacy explicit. Conversely, autocoup leaders employ a deceptive strategy,\nmanipulating legal processes to create a facade of democratic legitimacy. Despite\nthis veneer, their actions fundamentally undermine democratic principles.\nScholars have suggested alternative terms like \"incumbent overstay\" or \"executive\ntakeover\" to reflect the less overt nature of power grabs in these cases. This\nperceived legitimacy can provide autocoup leaders with a temporary advantage as\nopponents are often restricted to legal challenges.\n\n##### **Uncertainty:** The irregular paths to power taken by both types of leaders create uncertainty regarding their reigns and eventual departures\n\nThe irregular paths to power taken by coup-initiators and autocoup leaders create\nuncertainty regarding their reigns and eventual departures. Their ascension\nthrough irregular means undermines established power transition norms, leaving\ndoubts about their commitment to constitutional succession protocols. This\nuncertainty not only unsettles elites and citizens but also plagues the leaders\nthemselves, who grapple with the ambiguity surrounding the transfer of power –\nwhen, how, and to whom. Historical analyses underscore this predicament, with\ndata revealing that more than two-thirds of irregular exits from leadership stem\nfrom coup-related upheavals [@goemans2009].\n\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders face different levels of uncertainty following\ntheir rise to power. After a coup, three major uncertainties arise:\n\n-   **Leadership Assumption**: It is unclear who will assume leadership. Although\n    coup leaders often take power, some may return or promise to return power to\n    civilian leaders. Even among coup leaders, determining who will lead can be\n    problematic, as coup plotters are sometimes a group without a clear core\n    leader. For instance, following the 1973 Chilean coup, the initial plan for a\n    rotating presidency among military leaders was abandoned when General\n    Pinochet consolidated control and remained in power until 1990 [@svolik2014].\n\n-   **Duration of Rule**: The duration of the coup leader's rule is uncertain.\n    Leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt (1954 coup), Muammar Gaddafi in\n    Libya (1969 coup), and Idi Amin in Uganda (1971 coup) aimed to retain power\n    for life [@geddes2018], but their ability to do so was uncertain. Others\n    promise to transfer power to civilian authorities, but the timing and\n    fulfilment of these promises are unclear. For example, Myanmar's military\n    junta (2021 coup) has repeatedly extended a state of emergency, clinging to\n    power beyond the promised time-frame[^4]. Conversely, after the 2010 coup in\n    Niger, the military honoured their promise by restoring civilian rule within\n    the same year [@ginsburg2019].\n\n-   **Succession**: The successors of coup leaders are uncertain. Some may\n    designate successors from their inner circle, including family members, while\n    others may support general elections, though whether this will be fulfilled\n    as intended remains uncertain.\n\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders present a clearer picture regarding leadership and\ntenure. There is no ambiguity about who will rule after an autocoup. In the\nmedium term, autocoup leaders typically hold office themselves. Many, like Putin\nin Russia and Xi Jinping in China, seek to extend their rule indefinitely and are\nunlikely to relinquish power voluntarily. Others attempt to extend their terms\nincrementally, such as President Menem of Argentina, who overstayed successfully\nin 1993 but failed in his bid for another term in 1999 [@llanos2019].\n\n##### **Instability:** The awareness of shaky legitimacy and persistent uncertainty breeds insecurity and a sense of crisis\n\nThe awareness of their shaky legitimacy and the persistent uncertainty breeds\ninsecurity and a perpetual sense of crisis among coup-entry and autocoup leaders.\nIn a bid to solidify their grip on power, they often resort to reshaping power\ndynamics or purging potential adversaries. Paradoxically, these attempts to\nbolster stability frequently backfire, unleashing greater turmoil and\ninstability.\n\nThe stability of a regime, particularly in an autocracy, hinges on maintaining a\nbalance of power. Coups, however, inevitably disrupt this balance, even when they\nare bloodless, necessitating the creation of a new equilibrium. The ousting of\nprevious rulers requires dismantling the established governing structure and\nreshuffling high-ranking officials, actions that inherently generate instability\nand create adversaries for the new leadership. This makes restoring order and\nestablishing a balanced power structure notably challenging. Studies show that\nnew leaders often purge rival elite groups to consolidate their power at the\noutset of their tenure [@sudduth2017; @roessler2011].\n\nSuch actions can provoke backlash even from close allies. For instance, in\nUganda, President Obote's attempt to undermine the army commander-in-chief, Idi\nAmin, led to Amin gaining the army's support and ultimately ousting Obote in a\n1971 coup. Similarly, in Pakistan in 1999, shortly after Prime Minister Sharif\ndismissed powerful army chief General Pervez Musharraf, Sharif himself was ousted\nin a coup orchestrated by Musharraf and his supporters [@sudduth2017].\n\nTo consolidate power, coup-entry leaders often have to compromise with internal\nor external power challengers. However, these compromises are frequently unstable\nand easily broken. The situation becomes even more complex when there is a risk\nof civil war. Leaders may attempt to reduce the likelihood of subsequent coups,\npotentially increasing the chances of societal rebellions and civil wars\n[@roessler2011].\n\nMoreover, instability extends beyond leadership to policies. A new leadership\ngroup often brings new policies, and coups are sometimes triggered by\ndisagreements over significant policies. Major policy shifts can instigate\ndissent or grievances from various ruling factions, communities, regions,\nethnicities, or religions. In contrast, autocoup leaders encounter fewer of these\nissues, as their regimes experience fewer abrupt changes. They face less pressure\nto dismantle the existing ruling paradigm and establish a new order. Even when\nadjustments are necessary, they have more time to implement changes gradually.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-leaders .cell tbl-cap='Main features of autocoup and coup-entry leaders'}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 75.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 187.50pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 187.50pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}}\n\\toprule\nFeature & Autocoup Leader & Coup Entry Leader \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nIllegitimacy & Normally attained through\nlawful procedures, but\nlacking consensus\nlegitimacy & Blatantly illegal \\\\ \n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Uncertainty}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Initially with some certainty, but decreases as the leader's age grows or health worsens}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Significant uncertainty initially}}} \\\\ \nInstability & Relatively stable & Unstable except when a strongman emerges or constitutional institutions are established \\\\ \n{\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Balance of Power}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Generally in a better position of power}}} & {\\cellcolor[HTML]{EDEDE9}{\\textcolor[HTML]{000000}{Initially unclear and challenging to establish a balance}}} \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\endgroup\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nCoup-entry leaders face significantly greater challenges in consolidating power\ncompared to autocoup leaders. This disadvantage creates a self-perpetuating\ncycle. Weaker leaders struggle to attract and retain strong support, making them\nmore vulnerable to internal and external challenges. The perception of risk\ndiscourages potential allies, further eroding their power base.\n\nEmpirical evidence supports this dynamic. Data reveals a correlation between the\nfrequency of coup attempts in a country and the likelihood of future coups. For\nexample, @tbl-coups shows over a third of coups occurring in the top ten\ncountries with the most attempts since 1950. This suggests that the more coups\noccur in a country, the more likely additional coups are to happen in the future.\n\nConversely, autocoup leaders, often benefiting from a veneer of legitimacy and a\nstronger initial position, are better able to consolidate power and attract\nsupporters. This advantage can be self-reinforcing, as a strong power base\ndiscourages challenges and fosters loyalty. This dynamic is evident in cases like\nChina (2018), where the National People's Congress granted Xi Jinping the\npotential to rule for life[^5], and Russia (2020), where constitutional changes\nallow Putin to potentially remain in power until 2036[^6].\n\nThese factors contribute to a shorter expected tenure for coup-entry leaders\ncompared to the relatively longer tenures of autocoup leaders. The average\nsurvival period following an autocoup is approximately five years longer than\nthat of coup-entry leaders (@fig-logrank). Based on these observations, I propose\nthe following hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups\n> are more likely to survive longer compared to coup-entry leaders.***\n\n### Research Design\n\n#### Methodology: Survival analysis\n\nTo test the hypothesis, I will employ two Cox models to analyze the survival\ntenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. Unlike the Kaplan-Meier\nmodel, the Cox model allows for the estimation of the impacts of multiple\nfactors. Although it does not directly estimate the duration of tenure in office,\nit evaluates the hazard rate associated with being ousted from power.\nEssentially, this represents different facets of the same phenomenon: as a\nleader's cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their probability of\nsurvival in office decreases.\n\nThe first model will utilize the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox PH model),\nusing only the variables present at the entry year, without considering changes\nin these variables over the leaders' survival times.\n\nHowever, apart from the primary variable of interest in this research—the leader\ntype—control variables such as economic performance, Polity5 scores, and\npolitical stability do change over time. Therefore, the second model will account\nfor these variations by using the time-dependent Cox model.\n\n#### Dependent variables\n\n-   **Survival Time:** The duration of a leader's tenure, measured in days. For\n    coup-entry leaders, the survival time begins on the day they assume power\n    through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time starts on the\n    expiration date of their original legitimate term. For example, Xi Jinping\n    assumed power in 2013 and removed term limits in 2018. His original\n    legitimate tenure was set to end in 2023, so his survival time begins in\n    2023, marking the start of his post-autocoup tenure. The survival time\n    concludes on the day the leader exits office, applicable to both coup-entry\n    and autocoup leaders.\n\n-   **End point status:** This variable indicates the manner in which the\n    leader's tenure concluded, categorized as follows:\n\n    -   **0 = Censored:** This status is assigned to leaders who leave office\n        through regular means other than being ousted. This includes leaders\n        transferring power to their designated successors, leaving office as\n        their terms expire, losing in general elections, voluntarily leaving\n        office due to health issues, or dying of natural causes.\n\n    -   **1 = Ousted:** This status is assigned to leaders who are forced to\n        leave office. This includes leaders resigning under pressure, being\n        ousted by coups or other forces, or being assassinated.\n\n#### Key Independent variable: Leader type\n\nThis variable categorizes leaders into two distinct groups:\n\n-   **Group A = Autocoup Leader**: Leaders who extend their tenure through\n    autocoups.\n-   **Group B = Coup-Entry Leader**: Leaders who assume power through coups.\n\nThis variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the\nbasis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.\n\nThe data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from the\nautocoup dataset introduced in this study, Archigos, and PLAD.\n\n#### Control variables\n\n-   **Economic Performance:** This variable is measured using two indicators:\n    economic level and economic growth trend.\n\n    -   **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides\n        an indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a\n        country.\n\n    -   **Economic Growth Trend:** Assessed using the current-trend ratio,\n        developed by @krishnarajan2019, which is consistent with @eq-eq6 in\n        chapters 2 and 3.\n\nThe GDP per capita data, expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP)\nand measured in units of \\$10,000, is sourced from the V-Dem dataset by\n@fariss2022. To account for the economic impact of the previous year, this data\nis lagged by one year.\n\n-   **Political Stability:** This variable captures overall regime stability by\n    including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and\n    interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the\n    Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by @marshall2005current. This\n    index provides a comprehensive measure of the level of violence and conflict\n    within a country, which can significantly impact leadership survival.\n\n-   **Degree of Democracy:** The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5\n    scores at the entry year for each respective country. These scores range from\n    -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), capturing the extent of\n    democratic versus autocratic governance. This dataset is sourced from the\n    Center for Systemic Peace (CSP) and provides an essential measure of\n    political regime type, which can influence the stability and survival of\n    leaders in power.\n\n-   **Population Size:** To account for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,\n    the log of the population size is considered. This transformation helps in\n    managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The\n    data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its\n    influence on leadership survival. Larger populations may present more\n    governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting\n    the stability and longevity of a leader's tenure.\n\n-   **Leader's Age:** The age of the leader at the entry year is included as an\n    additional variable in the analysis, offering insights into potential\n    correlations with leadership survival. Older leaders may have different\n    experiences, networks, and health considerations that could influence their\n    ability to maintain power. This data is sourced from the leaders dataset by\n    Archigos and PLAD.\n\n### Results and discussion\n\n#### Model results\n\nUsing the `survival` package in R [@survival], I present the regression results\nfor both the Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model and the time-dependent Cox\nmodel in @tbl-cox.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-cox .cell tbl-cap='Cox models for survival time of different types of leaders'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{lcccccccc}\n\\toprule\n & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Cox PH Model}} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Time-dependent Cox Model}} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule(lr){2-5} \\cmidrule(lr){6-9}\n\\textbf{Characteristic} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n{\\bfseries Leader Type} &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\\\ \n    Autocoup leaders & 76 & 31 & 1.00 & — & 737 & 29 & 1.00 & — \\\\ \n    Coup-entry leaders & 148 & 73 & 2.71*** & 0.252 & 853 & 73 & 2.23*** & 0.246 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP Growth Trend} & 224 & 104 & 1.95 & 1.08 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.20* & 0.981 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP per capita} & 224 & 104 & 0.97* & 0.020 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.95** & 0.023 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Population: log} & 224 & 104 & 0.98 & 0.083 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.90 & 0.079 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Polity 5} & 224 & 104 & 0.99 & 0.025 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.01 & 0.023 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Political stability} & 224 & 104 & 1.00 & 0.053 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.11* & 0.049 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Age} & 224 & 104 & 1.01 & 0.010 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.00 & 0.011 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}}*p\\textless{}0.1; **p\\textless{}0.05; ***p\\textless{}0.01\\\\\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}}HR = Hazard Ratio, SE = Standard Error\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the Cox PH model and the time-dependent Cox model analyses revealed a\nstatistically significant association between leadership type and the hazard of\nremoval from power. Since time-dependent Cox model use the control variables\nwhich change over time, I interpret the main findings based on time-dependent\nmodel.\n\nCoup-entry leaders were found to have a hazard ratio of 2.23 in the\ntime-dependent model compared to autocoup leaders (reference group), assuming all\nother variables in the model are held constant. This suggests that coup-entry\nleaders face a significantly greater risk of removal from power compared to\nautocoup leaders. At any given time during their tenure, coup-entry leaders are\n2.23 times more likely to be ousted from power compared to autocoup leaders, all\nelse being equal in the model.\n\nThe control variables perform differently in the two models. Economic level (GDP\nper capita) exhibits statistically significant effects in both models. In the\ntime-dependent model, the hazard ratio of 0.95 indicates that for each unit\nincrease in GDP per capita (measured in units of \\$10,000), the hazard (or risk)\nof being ousted at any given time is reduced by 5%, assuming all other variables\nin the model are held constant.\n\nGDP growth trend demonstrates a more substantial effect in reducing the risk of\ncoups. Specifically, a 1 percentage point higher economic growth trend is\nassociated with an 80% reduction in the risk of being ousted, although this\neffect is only statistically significant at the 10% level. This suggests a\npossible trend where positive economic performance might mitigate the risk of\nremoval from power, but the evidence is not robust enough to confirm this\nconclusively.\n\nPolitical stability, as measured by the violence index, shows that a 1-point\nincrease in the index correlates with an 11% higher risk of being ousted.\nHowever, this effect is also only statistically significant at the 10% level,\nindicating a weaker but potentially important relationship between increased\nviolence and the risk of removal from office.\n\n#### Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxSurv .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-1.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-2.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-2}\n:::\n\nSurvival curves for Cox Model\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survival curves depicted in @fig-coxSurv illustrate the survival rates for\nleaders of both types.

This disparity\nsuggests that autocoup leaders tend to remain in power for longer durations than\ntheir coup-entry counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxHR .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nCall:\ncoxph(formula = Surv(T1, T2, status) ~ group + GDP_trend + GDP_pc + \n    pop_log + polity5 + violence + age, data = Mydata2, cluster = id)\n\n  n= 1590, number of events= 102 \n\n                             coef exp(coef)  se(coef) robust se      z Pr(>|z|)\ngroupCoup-entry leaders  0.802158  2.230348  0.245712  0.243824  3.290   0.0010\nGDP_trend               -1.589431  0.204042  0.981002  0.911011 -1.745   0.0810\nGDP_pc                  -0.046171  0.954878  0.022800  0.018675 -2.472   0.0134\npop_log                 -0.101345  0.903621  0.078758  0.078379 -1.293   0.1960\npolity5                  0.006888  1.006912  0.022551  0.023234  0.296   0.7669\nviolence                 0.101338  1.106651  0.048960  0.052556  1.928   0.0538\nage                      0.004961  1.004973  0.010516  0.010734  0.462   0.6440\n                          \ngroupCoup-entry leaders **\nGDP_trend               . \nGDP_pc                  * \npop_log                   \npolity5                   \nviolence                . \nage                       \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n                        exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95\ngroupCoup-entry leaders    2.2303     0.4484   1.38302    3.5968\nGDP_trend                  0.2040     4.9010   0.03422    1.2167\nGDP_pc                     0.9549     1.0473   0.92056    0.9905\npop_log                    0.9036     1.1067   0.77494    1.0537\npolity5                    1.0069     0.9931   0.96209    1.0538\nviolence                   1.1067     0.9036   0.99833    1.2267\nage                        1.0050     0.9951   0.98405    1.0263\n\nConcordance= 0.67  (se = 0.029 )\nLikelihood ratio test= 31.77  on 7 df,   p=4e-05\nWald test            = 27.21  on 7 df,   p=3e-04\nScore (logrank) test = 28.15  on 7 df,   p=2e-04,   Robust = 27.58  p=3e-04\n\n  (Note: the likelihood ratio and score tests assume independence of\n     observations within a cluster, the Wald and robust score tests do not).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-1.pdf){#fig-coxHR-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](coups_and_autocoups_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-2.pdf){#fig-coxHR-2}\n:::\n\nHazard ratios and 95% CIs for Leader Ousting\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-coxHR displays the hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals\nfor the variables incorporated in the Cox model. Both the Cox Proportional\nHazards (PH) model and the time-dependent model produce similar plots,\nreinforcing the robustness of the findings.

To evaluate this, we used the chi-square test based on\nSchoenfeld residuals to determine whether the covariate effects remain constant\n(proportional) over time. Although the Cox PH model violates the proportional\nhazards assumption, our primary analysis relies on the time-dependent Cox model,\nwhich does not show strong evidence of violating the proportional hazards\nassumption for any covariate. The global p-value of 0.416 is much greater than\nthe 5% significance level, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption is\nreasonably met for the time-dependent Cox model.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis chapter examined the survival durations of political leaders who come to\npower through irregular means, specifically coups and autocoups. I hypothesized\nthat the mode of accession significantly influences leader tenure. Employing\nsurvival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a\ntime-dependent Cox model, I found strong evidence that autocoup leaders generally\nenjoy longer tenures than coup-entry leaders.\n\nThe findings revealed a significant difference in average tenure, with\npost-autocoup leaders averaging approximately 11 years in power compared to 5.6\nyears for coup-entry leaders. The time-dependent Cox model further indicated that\ncoup-entry leaders are 2.23imes more likely to be ousted from power at any given\ntime compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal.\n\nThese results highlight the importance of understanding the phenomenon of\nautocoups, where leaders extend their rule by manipulating legal frameworks. Due\nto the relative ease and potential benefits of autocoups, this method of power\nretention might incentivize more leaders to employ it. Consequently, democratic\nbacksliding could become more prevalent as autocoups weaken democratic\ninstitutions and constitutional norms, particularly in nascent democracies or\nthose transitioning from autocracy.\n\nThis study contributes to the field of leadership survival by demonstrating that\nthe mode of accession significantly impacts leader tenure, a factor previously\nunder-explored in the literature. By utilizing both Cox models, the research\noffers robust analytical techniques for studying political leadership survival\nand provides strong evidence of divergent tenure lengths between these two types\nof irregular-entry leaders.\n\nHowever, limitations exist. The study relies heavily on the autocoup dataset\ncollected and coded by the author. The concept and data itself are relatively\nnovel within academia. Future research should refine and establish wider\nrecognition for the term \"autocoup,\" leading to more accurate and comprehensive\ndata collection efforts. Expanding the dataset to include more cases and\nintegrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions could yield a\nmore holistic understanding of political survival in such contexts.\n\nOverall, this chapter underscores the need for more nuanced approaches to\nstudying political tenure and the mechanisms of irregular power retention,\ncontributing valuable insights into the dynamics of political stability and the\nrisks associated with different forms of non-democratic leadership succession.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n### Main Findings\n\nThis study delves into the dynamics and implications of irregular power\ntransitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. The findings illuminate the complex\ninterplay between incumbents and challengers fighting for power.\n\nFirstly, our analysis reveals that the expected success rate of a coup attempt\nsignificantly influences its likelihood. This success rate is heavily influenced\nby the balance of power between the incumbent regime and challengers, which is\nlargely determined by regime type. We find that military regimes, although with\nmore control over their own military forces, face a higher risk of coups compared\nto dominant-party regimes.\n\nSecondly, the study introduces a redefined concept: the autocoup. Defined as an\nincumbent leader's refusal to relinquish power as mandated, this research\ndistinguishes autocoups from broader terms like self-coups. Based on this\ndefinition, we present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events\nfrom 1945 to 2022, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups. Case\nstudies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset's utility for quantitative\nresearch, providing a robust foundation for further analysis on autocoups.\n\nThirdly, employing survival analysis techniques, the study finds clear\ndifferences in leader longevity between those who come to power through coups and\nthose who extend their rule through autocoups. The results indicate that\ncoup-installed leaders face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to\nautocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend their rule.\n\n### Limitations and directions for future research\n\nThis study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular power transitions,\nbut some limitations require further exploration:\n\n-   **Data refinement:** Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach.\n    Future research should validate this classification system through additional\n    studies and expert evaluations.\n\n-   **Data harmonization:** The current analysis faces challenges due to\n    mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup\n    datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for\n    more robust comparisons.\n\n-   **Democratic backsliding:** While this study establishes a connection between\n    irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical\n    evidence is needed to solidify this link.\n\nSeveral avenues exist for future research:\n\n-   **Terminology and data collection:** Refining the \"autocoup\" concept and\n    achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive\n    data collection.\n\n-   **Dataset expansion:** Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and\n    integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can\n    provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.\n\n-   **Power dynamics and long-term impacts:** Utilizing this dataset, future\n    studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the\n    long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems,\n    particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization\n    of power.\n\nIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the dynamics of irregular power\ntransitions, specifically focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining\nautocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader\nlongevity, we establish a framework for understanding irregular transitions and\nleader survival. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of democratic\nresilience and political stability. Future research can build upon this\nfoundation by conducting further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup\ndataset and continuing to refine the framework.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: According to the Archigos dataset, \"Removed by Military, without Foreign\n    Support\" and \"Removed by Other Government Actors, without Foreign Support\" in\n    the variable exitcode are classified as coups.\n\n[^2]: The definitions and concepts of power expansion and power extension can\n    often be ambiguous.
