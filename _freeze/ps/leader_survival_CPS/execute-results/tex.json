The central hypothesis posits that the mode of accession has a profound impact on leadership longevity. Utilizing Cox proportional hazards and time-dependent Cox models, this study provides robust empirical evidence of disparate survival times between these two leader types. The findings reveal that, on average, coup-installed leaders are 2.23 times more likely to be ousted from power than autocoup leaders, all else being equal. These results have far-reaching implications for political stability and democratic processes, suggesting that the perceived low costs and high rewards associated with autocoups may incentivize incumbents to prolong their tenure through this means, potentially contributing to democratic erosion. This research makes a notable contribution to the academic literature by offering nuanced insights into the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and enhances our understanding of the complex interplay between power acquisition methods and leadership longevity.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Leadership Survival, Cox Model]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n  echo: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe enduring fascination with the longevity of political leaders has sparked\nextensive research in political science, with scholars seeking to understand why\nsome leaders maintain power for decades while others are ousted in a matter of\nmonths or even days. However, a specific subset of leaders—those who ascend to\npower through coups or extend their tenure through autocoups—has received\nrelatively limited attention. Examining the tenures of these leaders is crucial,\nas it sheds light on the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and their\nimplications for political stability and democratic processes.\n\nIn contrast to leaders who attain power through conventional means, those who\nrise through irregular channels, such as coups or autocoups, present more complex\nand intriguing cases for study. The Archigos dataset highlights the prevalence of\nirregular power transitions. Between 1945 and 2015, over half of leaders who\nassumed power irregularly also exited irregularly, a rate significantly higher\nthan that of leaders who accessed office through regular channels.\n\nCoup-installed and autocoup leaders constitute a substantial portion of these\nirregular cases. The Archigos dataset notes that of 374 leaders who exited\nirregularly, 246 (65.8%) were ousted through coups. Furthermore, research by\n@frantz2016 demonstrates that coup-related exits account for approximately\none-third of all exits in autocracies, surpassing any other transition type.\nAdditionally, the autocoup dataset, introduced by @zhu2024, documents 110\nautocoup attempts between 1945 and 2023, of which 87 were successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring the tenure of coup-installed and autocoup leaders poses challenges due\nto the inherent irregularity and uncertainty of their positions. Nevertheless, a\ncomparative analysis reveals that leaders who extend power through autocoups tend\nto have longer average post-autocoup tenures (approximately 11 years)\ncompared to coup-installed leaders (approximately 5.7 years),\nsuggesting a potential tenure gap of over five years.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Survival curves of autocoup and coup-installed leaders](leader_survival_CPS_files/figure-pdf/fig-logrank-1.pdf){#fig-logrank fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nA preliminary log-rank test in survival analysis, as illustrated in @fig-logrank,\ndemonstrates a statistically significant difference between the tenures of\nautocoup and coup-installed leaders. The survival curve for autocoup leaders\nconsistently exceeds that of coup-installed leaders, indicating longer survival\ntimes and a reduced risk of ouster for autocoup leaders.\n\nThis study posits that the method of accession significantly influences\nleadership longevity. Coup-installed leaders likely confront greater challenges\nto their rule, resulting in shorter average tenures compared to autocoup leaders.\nThe analysis, employing Cox proportional hazards and time-dependent Cox models,\nsupports this hypothesis, demonstrating that autocoup leaders generally\nexperience longer tenures than coup-installed leaders.\n\nThis research offers two primary contributions to the field. First, it highlights\nan understudied factor in leadership survival analysis: the impact of the method\nof accession to power. The findings suggest that leader survival is influenced\nnot only by ruling strategies but also by the initial method of acquiring power.\nSecond, by employing survival models, this study provides empirical evidence of\nthe significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and coup-installed\nleaders. This insight may explain the increasing prevalence of tenure extensions\nthrough autocoups since 2000, as more incumbents observe and potentially emulate\nsuccessful precedents.\n\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a\ncomprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context\nfor this research. Section 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of\ncoup and autocoup leaders. Section 4 outlines the methodology and data used,\nincluding the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of\nleadership longevity. Section 5 presents the analysis findings and a detailed\ndiscussion of the results. Finally, Section 6 concludes by synthesizing key\ntakeaways and exploring their broader implications for political stability and\ndemocratic processes.\n\n## Literature review\n\nThe longevity of political leaders, which varies widely across different regimes,\ncountries, and historical periods, has been a longstanding focus of research in\npolitical science. This field can be divided into two interconnected areas:\nregime survival and individual leader survival, which are distinct but related\nconcepts. Regime survival focuses on the endurance of political systems, such as\nmonarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures, while leader\nsurvival concerns the duration of individual leaders' time in office.\n\nPolitical survival patterns vary widely across different systems. Parliamentary\ndemocracies (e.g., Japan, United Kingdom) often experience prolonged periods of\nparty dominance coupled with frequent leadership changes. Similarly, communist\nregimes (e.g., China) typically demonstrate enduring party rule with more\nfrequent leadership transitions. Presidential systems (e.g., United States) and\nmany military regimes tend to exhibit more frequent changes in both ruling party\nor junta and leader.\n\nThe existing literature on leader survival is extensive and multifaceted. Some\nstudies explore specific mechanisms influencing leadership longevity within\nparticular regimes, such as democracies [@svolik2014] or autocracies\n[@davenport2021]. Others aim to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks\nexplaining leader survival across different political systems\n[@buenodemesquita2003]. While a universal theory remains an aspirational goal,\nthe complexities of leadership survival across diverse regime types present\nsignificant challenges.\n\nPower transition mechanisms vary substantially across different types of regimes,\nparticularly between democracies and autocracies. Autocratic systems often\nfeature closed leadership selection processes, restricted to a narrow pool of\nindividuals. While some autocracies may hold elections, significant barriers to\nentry for legitimate challengers typically persist. The opacity of selection\nprocesses in autocracies makes it difficult to assess genuine levels of public\nsupport compared to democracies. Conceptualizing selectorates or winning\ncoalitions, as proposed by @buenodemesquita2003, becomes problematic in many\nautocratic contexts.\n\nGiven these complexities, focusing research on specific regimes or leader types\nmay be more fruitful. The study of irregular leaders, such as those who ascend to\npower through coups or extend their tenures through autocoups, offers a\ncompelling avenue for research due to the inherent complexities and uncertainties\nsurrounding their leadership trajectories.\n\nTwo primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.\nThe first emphasizes objective factors and resources, such as personal competence\n[@yu2016], societal stability [@arriola2009], economic development [@palmer1999;\n@williams2011], natural resource endowments [@smith2004; @quirozflores2012;\n@wright2013], and external support [@licht2009; @wright2008; @thyne2017]. The\nsecond focuses on subjective factors and strategies, including political\npolicies, responses to opposition, and tactics for consolidating power\n[@gandhi2007; @morrison2009; @escribà-folch2013; @davenport2021].\n\nCoups, a significant aspect of irregular leadership transitions, have received\nconsiderable scholarly attention. Research has examined coup prevention\nstrategies [@powell2017; @sudduth2017; @debruin2020]. Studies have explored the\nimpact of coups on leadership and the subsequent actions of coup leaders\n[@sudduth2017, @sudduth2018, @easton2018].\n\nHowever, a significant gap remains in the literature regarding the comparison of\nleadership survival between coup-installed and autocoup leaders. This study aims\nto address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership\nsurvival for these two leader types.\n\nBy focusing on the comparison between coup-installed and autocoup leaders, this\nstudy seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of political survival\nin irregular leadership transitions. This approach may offer valuable insights\ninto the complex dynamics of leader longevity across different political\ncontexts.\n\n### Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-installed leaders\n\nStudying leadership survival in political systems is challenging due to the\nopacity and diverse mechanisms of power transitions. These challenges, however,\nunderscore the significance of this research, as it illuminates understudied\ndynamics in political leadership. Although the survival of political leaders is\ncomplex and varied, some patterns do emerge. Leaders of similar types often\nexhibit similar characteristics, allowing for meaningful analysis.\n\n### Key definitions and scope\n\nBefore delving into the comparison, it is essential to clarify several key\nterminologies:\n\n-   **Coup and autocoup**: Coup is defined as \"illegal and overt attempts by the\n    military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting\n    executive\" [@powell2011], and autocoup is defined as \"the illegitimate\n    extension of an incumbent leader's term in office beyond the originally\n    mandated limits\" [@zhu2024]. These definitions provide a clear distinction\n    between the two types of irregular leadership transitions.\n\n-   **Tenure length threshold**: To ensure meaningful analysis, this study\n    focuses on leaders with substantial periods in power, applying a six-month\n    threshold to both autocoup and coup-installed leaders. This criterion filters\n    out ephemeral leadership episodes, allowing for a more robust examination of\n    survival dynamics.\n\n-   **Autocoup leader**: An incumbent leader who successfully employs\n    illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. This\n    definition encompasses various methods of power consolidation that circumvent\n    established democratic processes or constitutional limits.\n\n-   **Coup-installed leader**: The individual who assumes power after a\n    successful coup, regardless of their role in the coup itself. This broad\n    definition allows for the inclusion of both coup instigators and those\n    selected to lead post-coup, providing a comprehensive view of leadership\n    dynamics following forceful regime change.\n\nThis study focuses on comparing the post-autocoup tenure of autocoup leaders with\nthe post-coup tenure of coup-installed leaders. This comparative approach is\nmotivated by the relevance and similarity of these leader types in terms of\nillegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. By examining these parallel yet\ndistinct paths to power, we can gain insights into the factors that influence\nleadership longevity in irregular leadership transitions.\n\n### Challenges in power consolidation\n\nBoth autocoup and coup-installed leaders confront distinct challenges in\nconsolidating their power, primarily stemming from the varying intensity of\nissues related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability. This disparity\ncreates an uneven playing field in terms of power dynamics, placing\ncoup-installed leaders at a significant disadvantage. @tbl-leaders provides a\ncomparative overview of the main features of autocoup and coup-installed leaders,\nhighlighting these key differences.\n\n\\blandscape\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-leaders .cell tbl-cap='Main features of autocoup and coup-installed leaders'}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{1\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 112.50pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 225.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{\\dimexpr 225.00pt -2\\tabcolsep-1.5\\arrayrulewidth}}\n\\toprule\nFeature & Autocoup Leader & Coup Entry Leader \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nIllegitimacy & Normally attained through\nlawful procedures, but\nlacking consensus\nlegitimacy & Blatantly illegal \\\\ \nUncertainty & Initially with some certainty, but decreases as the leader's age grows or health worsens & Significant uncertainty initially \\\\ \nInstability & Relatively stable & Unstable except when a strongman emerges or constitutional institutions are established \\\\ \nBalance of Power & Generally in a better position of power & Initially unclear and challenging to establish a balance \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n\n\n\n\\elandscape\n\n#### Illegitimacy\n\nWhile both types of leaders suffer from a legitimacy deficit, the nature and\nperception of this deficit differ significantly:\n\n-   **Coup-installed leaders**: Their illegitimacy is blatant and unambiguous,\n    stemming from the overt and often violent seizure of power. This overt act\n    undermines pre-existing norms and institutions, generating immediate domestic\n    and international condemnation.\n\n-   **Autocoup leaders**: In contrast, autocoup leaders employ a more subtle and\n    deceptive strategy, manipulating legal processes and institutions to create a\n    façade of democratic legitimacy. This veneer of legality, while often thin,\n    can provide a degree of cover and buy time for consolidating power.\n\n#### Uncertainty\n\nThe irregular paths to power for both types of leaders create uncertainty about\nthe longevity of their rule and the mechanisms of their eventual departure.\nHowever, the levels and sources of this uncertainty differ significantly.\n\n-   **Coup-installed leaders:** These leaders face a trifecta of uncertainties.\n    First, the immediate aftermath of a coup often involves a struggle for power\n    within the junta or ruling coalition, creating ambiguity about who will\n    ultimately consolidate control. Second, the tenure of coup-installed leaders\n    is inherently precarious, subject to internal rivalries, popular uprisings,\n    or counter-coups. Third, the lack of established succession mechanisms\n    further amplifies uncertainty, making it difficult to predict the transfer of\n    power and potentially triggering future instability.\n\n-   **Autocoup leaders:** While not immune to uncertainty, autocoup leaders\n    generally present a clearer picture. The question of who will rule\n    post-autocoup is largely settled, as the incumbent retains power.\n    Furthermore, many autocoup leaders openly aspire to extend their rule\n    indefinitely or incrementally, attempting to establish a sense of permanence.\n    This perceived stability, whether real or manufactured, can contribute to a\n    more predictable political environment, at least in the short term.\n\n#### Instability\n\nThe awareness of shaky legitimacy and persistent uncertainty inevitably breeds\ninsecurity and a sense of crisis, forcing both autocoup and coup-installed\nleaders to prioritize stabilization measures. However, the nature and intensity\nof these challenges differ:\n\n-   **Coup-installed leaders:** These leaders face the daunting task of rapidly\n    reshaping power dynamics, often resorting to purges and crackdowns to\n    eliminate potential adversaries and consolidate control. This process of\n    dismantling existing structures and building new ones generates significant\n    instability, potentially alienating former allies and triggering resistance\n    from various segments of society. The need to appease powerful actors both\n    domestically and internationally further limits their options, forcing them\n    into compromises that can undermine their authority and long-term stability.\n\n-   **Autocoup leaders:** In contrast, autocoup leaders often benefit from a\n    degree of continuity in regime personnel and institutions. This relative\n    stability allows them to implement changes gradually, minimizing disruptions\n    and mitigating potential backlash. While they may still face opposition, they\n    are less likely to confront immediate and existential threats to their rule,\n    providing them with more time and leverage to consolidate power.\n\nBy understanding these contrasting challenges, we can better appreciate the\nrelative advantages and disadvantages faced by autocoup and coup-installed\nleaders. This comparative perspective provides a nuanced framework for analyzing\nthe strategies these leaders employ to consolidate power and navigate the\nperilous terrain of irregular leadership transitions.\n\n### Empirical evidence and hypothesis\n\nEmpirical evidence substantiates the disadvantage faced by coup-installed\nleaders, revealing a complex interplay between historical precedent, power\nconsolidation challenges, and leadership longevity. This section presents key\ndata points and introduces the central hypothesis guiding this study.\n\nData analysis shows a significant correlation between the frequency of coup\nattempts in a country and the likelihood of future coups. Notably, over a third\nof coups have occurred in the top ten countries with the most attempts since 1950\n[@powell2011]. This pattern suggests a self-reinforcing cycle of political\ninstability, where each successful coup increases the probability of subsequent\nattempts, creating an environment of persistent uncertainty for coup-installed\nleaders.\n\nThe disparity in leadership longevity between autocoup and coup-installed leaders\nis starkly illustrated by survival data. As depicted in @fig-logrank, the average\nsurvival period following an autocoup is approximately five years longer than\nthat of coup-installed leaders. This substantial difference in tenure length\nunderscores the divergent challenges faced by these two types of leaders in\nmaintaining their grip on power.\n\nThe distinct challenges faced by autocoup leaders and coup-installed leaders in\nconsolidating power create a self-perpetuating cycle that significantly\ninfluences their tenure length:\n\n-   Coup-installed leaders: Face greater legitimacy challenges and internal\n    instability; Struggle to attract and retain strong support; More vulnerable\n    to internal and external challenges; Shorter average tenures reinforce\n    perception of instability.\n\n-   Autocoup leaders: Often benefit from a veneer of legitimacy and a stronger\n    initial position; Better able to consolidate power and attract supporters;\n    Face less immediate threat of overthrow; Longer average tenures contribute to\n    perception of stability.\n\nThis cycle suggests that the initial method of power acquisition or extension has\nfar-reaching consequences for a leader's ability to maintain their position over\ntime.\n\nBased on these observations and the theoretical framework outlined earlier, I\npropose the following hypothesis:\n\n***H1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups\nare more likely to survive longer extended tenure compared to coup-installed\nleaders.***\n\nThis hypothesis encapsulates the expected outcome of the divergent challenges and\nadvantages faced by autocoup and coup-installed leaders. By testing this\nhypothesis, I aim to quantify the impact of the method of power acquisition or\nextension on leadership longevity, contributing to a more nuanced understanding\nof political survival in contexts of irregular transitions.\n\n## Research design\n\nThis section employs survival analysis to test the hypothesis that autocoup\nleaders have longer survival times in office compared to coup-installed leaders.\nThis study uses Cox models to analyze the survival tenures of autocoup and\ncoup-installed leaders, controlling for various factors that may affect their\ntime in office.\n\n### Methodology: Survival analysis\n\nTwo Cox models will be employed to analyze the survival tenures of coup-installed\nand autocoup leaders:\n\n-   **Cox proportional hazards (PH) model**: This model uses only the variables\n    present at the entry year, without considering changes over time.\n\n-   **Time-dependent Cox model**: This model accounts for variations in\n    time-dependent control variables such as economic performance and political\n    stability.\n\nThe Cox model is preferred over the Kaplan-Meier model because it enables the\nestimation of the impact of multiple factors. Although it does not directly\nestimate the duration of tenure, it assesses the hazard rate associated with\nbeing ousted from power. This approach captures different facets of the same\nphenomenon: as a leader's cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their\nprobability of survival in office decreases.\n\n### Dependent variables[^1]\n\nThe dependent variables include survival time and end point status:\n\n-   **Survival time:** Survival time refers to the duration of a leader's tenure,\n    measured in days. For coup-installed leaders, the survival time begins on the\n    day they assume power through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time\n    starts on the expiration date of their original legitimate term. For example,\n    Russia's president Vladimir Putin assumed power in 2000 and, after serving\n    two terms, stepped down in 2008. However, he remained in a powerful position\n    as the prime minister and hand-picked Dmitry Medvedev to succeed him as\n    president, while continuing to control the power behind the scenes. In this\n    case, Putin's survival time begins in 2008, marking the start of his\n    post-autocoup tenure. The survival time concludes on the day the leader\n    finally exits office, applicable to both coup-installed and autocoup leaders.\n\n-   **End point status:** This variable indicates the manner in which the\n    leader's tenure concluded, categorized as follows:\n\n    **0 = Censored:** This status is assigned to leaders who leave office through\n    regular means other than being ousted. This includes leaders transferring\n    power to their designated successors, leaving office as their terms expire,\n    losing in general elections, voluntarily leaving office due to health issues,\n    or dying of natural causes.\n\n    **1 = Ousted:** This status is assigned to leaders who are forced to leave\n    office. This includes leaders resigning under pressure, being ousted by coups\n    or other forces, or being assassinated.\n\n### Key independent variable: leader type\n\nThe key independent variable is the leader type, which categorizes leaders into\ntwo distinct groups:\n\n-   **Group A = Autocoup leader**: Leaders who extend their tenure through\n    autocoups.\n-   **Group B = Coup-installed leader**: Leaders who assume power through coups.\n\nThis variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the\nbasis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.\n\nThe data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from the\nArchigos dataset [@goemans2009] and PLAD dataset [@bomprezzi2024wedded]. The\nautocoup dataset is introduced by @zhu2024.\n\n### Control variables\n\nThe control variables are chosen based on the research of @gassebner2016. They\nanalysed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic\ngrowth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are\nparticularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance,\npolitical violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control\nvariables.\n\n\n\n-   **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an\nindication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a\ncountry. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international 1000\ndollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by @fariss2022.\n-   **Economic Performance:** Measured using the current-trend ($CT$) ratio\ndeveloped by @krishnarajan2019. This ratio compares a country's current GDP\nper capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A\nhigher $CT$ ratio indicates stronger economic performance. For a country $i$\nat year $t$, the $CT$ ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n$$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n    \\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq6}\n\n-   **Political stability:** This variable captures overall regime stability by\n    including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and\n    interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the\n    variable “actotal” in the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset\n    [@marshall2005current], with 0 representing the most stable conditions (no\n    violence at all) and 18 representing the most unstable.\n\n-   **Previous coups:** Included in the selection equation as either: a) The\n    number of previous coups in a country (Model 1), or b) The time since the\n    last coup attempt (Model 2 for robustness check).\n\n-   **Population size:** To account for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,\n    we consider the log of the population size. This transformation helps in\n    managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The\n    data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its\n    influence on power transitions. Larger populations may present more\n    governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting\n    the stability and longevity of a leader's tenure.\n\n-   **Leader's age:** The age of the leader is included as an additional variable\n    in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with\n    leadership strength. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks,\n    and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain\n    power. This data is sourced from Archigos and PLAD datasets.\n\nUnlike the analysis of classic coup determinants, which could theoretically occur\nin any given year, I assume that an autocoup happens only once during an\nincumbent leader's tenure, as a successful autocoup negates the need for another\nattempt. However, this assumption does not always reflect reality, as leaders\nmight attempt further extensions or try again after a failed attempt. For\nsimplicity, I overlook these possibilities in our analysis.\n\nTherefore, in our probit model, the unit of analysis for autocoups is the entire\ntenure of a leader, rather than a country-year. I establish a base year for the\nvariables: for leaders who staged an autocoup, we use the year of their first\nattempt as the base year; for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, I use the\nmiddle year of their tenure as the base year.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n### Model results\n\nUsing the ***surviavl*** package in R [@survival], I present the regression\nresults for both the Cox Proportional Hazards model (Cox PH) and the\ntime-dependent Cox model in @tbl-cox.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-cox .cell tbl-cap='Cox models for survival time of different types of leaders'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lcccccccc}\n\\toprule\n & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Cox PH Model}} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\textbf{Time-dependent Cox Model}} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule(lr){2-5} \\cmidrule(lr){6-9}\n\\textbf{Characteristic} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{HR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1,2}} & \\textbf{SE}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n{\\bfseries Leader Type} &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\\\ \n    Autocoup leaders & 76 & 31 & 1.00 & — & 737 & 29 & 1.00 & — \\\\ \n    Coup-installed leaders & 148 & 73 & 2.71*** & 0.252 & 853 & 73 & 2.23*** & 0.246 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP Growth Trend} & 224 & 104 & 1.94 & 1.08 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.20* & 0.981 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries GDP per capita} & 224 & 104 & 0.97* & 0.020 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.95** & 0.023 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Population: log} & 224 & 104 & 0.98 & 0.083 & 1,590 & 102 & 0.90 & 0.079 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Polity 5} & 224 & 104 & 0.99 & 0.025 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.01 & 0.023 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Political stability} & 224 & 104 & 1.00 & 0.053 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.11* & 0.049 \\\\ \n{\\bfseries Age} & 224 & 104 & 1.01 & 0.010 & 1,590 & 102 & 1.00 & 0.011 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}}*p\\textless{}0.1; **p\\textless{}0.05; ***p\\textless{}0.01\\\\\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}}HR = Hazard Ratio, SE = Standard Error\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\end{table}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBoth models showed a statistically significant relationship between leadership\ntype and the hazard of removal from power. Since time-dependent Cox model use the\ncontrol variables which change over time, I interpret the main findings based on\ntime-dependent model.\n\nCoup-installed leaders were found to have a hazard ratio of 2.23 in the\ntime-dependent model compared to autocoup leaders (reference group), assuming all\nother variables in the model are held constant. This suggests that coup-installed\nleaders face a significantly greater risk of removal from power compared to\nautocoup leaders. At any given time during their tenure, coup-installed leaders\nare 2.23 times more likely to be ousted from power compared to autocoup leaders,\nall else being equal in the model.\n\nThe control variables perform differently in the two models. Economic level (GDP\nper capita) exhibits statistically significant effects in both models. In the\ntime-dependent model, the hazard ratio of 0.95 indicates that for each unit\nincrease in GDP per capita (measured in units of \\$10,000), the hazard (or risk)\nof being ousted at any given time is reduced by 5%, assuming all other variables\nin the model are held constant.\n\nGDP growth trend demonstrates a more substantial effect in reducing the risk of\ncoups. Specifically, a 1 percentage point higher economic growth trend is\nassociated with an 80% reduction in the risk of being ousted, although this\neffect is only statistically significant at the 10% level. This suggests a\npossible trend where positive economic performance might mitigate the risk of\nremoval from power, but the evidence is not robust enough to confirm this\nconclusively.\n\nPolitical stability, as measured by the violence index, shows that a 1-point\nincrease in the index correlates with an 11% higher risk of being ousted.\nHowever, this effect is also only statistically significant at the 10% level,\nindicating a weaker but potentially important relationship between increased\nviolence and the risk of removal from office.\n\n### Discussion\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxSurv .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](leader_survival_CPS_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-1.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](leader_survival_CPS_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxSurv-2.pdf){#fig-coxSurv-2}\n:::\n\nSurvival curves for Cox Model\n:::\n\n\n\nThe survival curves in @fig-coxSurv displays the survival rates for both types of\nleaders, highlighting the differences in their survival curves. Both the Cox PH\nmodel and the time-dependent Cox model yield similar results. Notably, the\nsurvival curve for coup-installed leaders has a significantly lower trajectory\nthan that of autocoup leaders. The steeper drop at the early stage for\ncoup-installed leaders indicates they are more likely to be ousted shortly after\nassuming power. Additionally, the survival curve for coup-installed leaders\ncrosses the median survival line much earlier (about 3,000 days) than that of\nautocoup leaders (about 8,500 days). This disparity suggests that autocoup\nleaders tend to remain in power for longer durations than their coup-installed\ncounterparts.\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-coxHR .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cox PH Model](leader_survival_CPS_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-1.pdf){#fig-coxHR-1}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time-dependent Cox Model](leader_survival_CPS_files/figure-pdf/fig-coxHR-2.pdf){#fig-coxHR-2}\n:::\n\nHazard ratios and 95% CIs for Leader Ousting\n:::\n\n\n\n@fig-coxHR displays the hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals\nfor the variables incorporated in the Cox model. Both the Cox Proportional\nHazards (PH) model and the time-dependent model produce similar plots,\nreinforcing the robustness of the findings. Key points to note include:\n\n-   The closer the hazard ratio (represented by the dots) is to 1, the less\n    impact the variable has on the risk of being ousted. A hazard ratio of 1\n    indicates no effect.\n\n-   The whiskers extending from the dots represent the 95% confidence intervals.\n    If these whiskers cross the vertical blue line at 1, it indicates that the\n    variable is not statistically significant at the 5% level.\n\n-   The hazard ratio for coup-installed leaders is significantly greater than 1\n    and statistically significant at the 5% level. This indicates that\n    coup-installed leaders face a substantially higher risk of being ousted\n    compared to autocoup leaders.\n\n-   Most other variables have hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting that a\n    one-unit increase in these variables does not significantly affect the risk\n    of being ousted.\n\n-   Although the hazard ratio for GDP growth trend is considerably less than 1 in\n    the time-dependent model, indicating a potential protective effect, it is not\n    statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it is statistically\n    significant at the 10% level, suggesting that better economic performance may\n    help to consolidate the rule of the incumbents to some extent, albeit the\n    evidence is not as strong.\n\n### Assessing the proportional hazards assumption\n\nAssessing the proportional hazards assumption is crucial for the validity of the\nCox model results. To evaluate this, we used the chi-square test based on\nSchoenfeld residuals to determine whether the covariate effects remain constant\n(proportional) over time. Although the Cox PH model violates the proportional\nhazards assumption, our primary analysis relies on the time-dependent Cox model,\nwhich does not show strong evidence of violating the proportional hazards\nassumption for any covariate. The global p-value of 0.416 is much greater than\nthe 5% significance level, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption is\nreasonably met for the time-dependent Cox model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study explores the survival durations of political leaders who come to power\nthrough unconventional means, specifically focusing on coups and autocoups. Based\non the hypothesis that the mode of accession affects leader tenure, I use\nsurvival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a\ntime-dependent Cox model, to investigate this phenomenon. The findings suggest\nthat autocoup leaders tend to have longer tenures than coup-installed leaders.\n\nEmpirical analysis reveals a significant disparity in tenure length: leaders who\nassume power via autocoup remain in office for an average of 11 years, compared\nto just 5.6 years for those installed by coups. Moreover, the time-dependent Cox\nmodel indicates that coup-installed leaders are 2.23 times more likely to be\nousted from power at any given time compared to their autocoup counterparts, all\nother factors being equal. These findings underscore the importance of\nunderstanding the autocoup as a mechanism through which leaders extend their rule\nby manipulating legal frameworks and weakening institutional constraints.\n\nThe implications of these findings are profound. The relative ease and potential\nrewards of an autocoup could incentivize more leaders to resort to this method of\npower retention, particularly in fragile democracies or transitioning regimes.\nConsequently, democratic backsliding may become more prevalent, as autocoups\nerode democratic institutions and undermine constitutional norms.\n\nThis study contributes significantly to the literature on political leadership\nsurvival by showing that the mode of accession has a substantial impact on leader\ntenure, an aspect that has received limited attention in previous research.\nMethodologically, this work advances the field by applying robust survival\nanalysis techniques, including both Cox models, to provide a nuanced\nunderstanding of the dynamics that influence leadership stability.\n\nHowever, the study is not without limitations. The analysis relies on an autocoup\ndataset that was collected and coded by the author, a relatively novel concept in\nthe academic sphere. As the understanding and recognition of \"autocoup\" as a term\ncontinue to evolve, future research should refine and expand the dataset.\nIncorporating additional cases and cross-referencing with other forms of\nirregular leadership transitions would contribute to a more comprehensive view of\npolitical survival under such conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the need for more refined approaches to\nstudying political tenure and irregular power retention. By offering valuable\ninsights into the dynamics of political stability and the risks associated with\nnon-democratic leadership transitions, this research emphasizes the importance of\ncontinued investigation into the complex relationships between power, legitimacy,\nand survival in political leadership.\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n[^1]: The dataset used in this article is publicly available and can be accessed\n    at: <https://github.com/reddylee/Datasets>.\n",
