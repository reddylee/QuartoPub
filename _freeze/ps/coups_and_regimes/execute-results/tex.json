However, consensus remains elusive regarding why coups are more prevalent in certain countries while less so in others. Previous scholarship exploring the determinants of coup attempts has often overlooked the crucial aspect of coup success. Given the severe consequences of a failed coup, coup plotters are unlikely to proceed unless they perceive a high chance of success. Thus, the expected outcome of a coup—whether successful or unsuccessful—is not merely incidental but serves as a pivotal determinant of coup attempts. The decision to stage a coup is a self-selected variable contingent upon the anticipated success rate of coups. This study employs a sample selection model (specifically, a two-stage probit model) to elucidate why coups are more common in some autocratic countries but rare in others. I contend that coup attempts are largely shaped by the likelihood of coup success, which, in turn, hinges on the power dynamics between coup perpetrators and incumbents. These power dynamics are influenced by the regime type and their distinct responses to internal and external shocks.\nkeywords: [Coup, Autocracy, Regime types, Sample selection]\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nCoups occur with varying frequency across different countries, with some\nexperiencing them more frequently than others. According to the Global Instances\nof Coups (GIC)[^1] dataset [@powell2011], Latin American countries such as\nBolivia witnessed 23 coups\nbetween $1950$ and $1984$, while Argentina experienced\n20 during a similar time\nframe. However, Mexico's authoritarian period from $1917$ to $2000$ saw no coups\nat all. In Africa, Sudan endured\n17 coups between $1955$ and\n$2023$, whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since $1950$. Similar\npatterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia. The question of why\ncoups occur more frequently in certain regions, countries, and periods, while\nbeing less common in others, has captivated scholars for decades. Consequently,\nscholars have delved into extensive research on coups. Despite numerous efforts\nin past studies to shed light on these disparities, a definitive model or set of\ndeterminants for analysing coups remains elusive. As highlighted by\n@gassebner2016, although approximately one hundred potential determinants of\ncoups have been suggested, the fundamental question remains unanswered.\n\nHowever, despite extensive research by scholars, the impact of anticipated\noutcomes on coup initiation has not received sufficient attention. When analysing\nthe determinants of coups, it's crucial not to overlook the most significant\ncharacteristic of coups themselves. As noted by @powell2011, coups are \"illegal\nand overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to\nunseat the sitting executive.\"[@powell2011, P.252]. Due to their illegality, the\nconsequences of a failed coup could be severe, with perpetrators risking\nimprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, the repercussions extend\nto the families of the coup perpetrators.\n\nDespite the significant risks associated with coups, as shown in @tbl-coups since\n$1950$, there have still been as many as 491 coups worldwide.\nFurthermore, more importantly, half of these coups have been successful. At first\nglance, coups seem to be a high-success-rate, high-reward political venture and\nspeculation. However, compared to over $12,000$ country-years since $1950$, the\noccurrence of 491 coups appears rather rare, accounting for less than\n$4\\%$ [@powell2011].\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate indicate that the initiation of\ncoups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring\ndepends greatly on its potential success rate. Coup plotters carefully assess\ntheir chances before staging a coup. If they decide to proceed, it suggests that\nthe conditions are relatively ripe, hence the fifty-fifty success rate. Plans\nwith immature conditions and low chances of success are automatically filtered\nout. Fundamentally, launching a coup is not like participating in a general\nelection, where failure in one election allows for another attempt in the next\nelection. A coup is a high-stakes gamble where success brings substantial\nrewards, while failure may result in martyrdom. Failure, put differently, means\npermanent and absolute defeat. Furthermore, the outcomes of coups are typically\ndecided within a matter of days, sometimes even mere hours. Unlike prolonged\nconflicts where victories or defeats may shift over time, the success of a coup\nis often sealed at its inception. Every detail must be meticulously planned and\narranged beforehand.\n\nHence, the factors influencing the success rates of coups play a significant role\nin shaping coup attempts. This study employs a sample selection model to examine\nthe factors affecting the success rates of coups and, consequently, the\nlikelihood of coup attempts. I posit that the power dynamics among coup\nperpetrators, incumbents, and other ruling elites are pivotal in determining the\nsuccess of coups. These dynamics are largely contingent on regime types,\nhighlighting the pivotal role of regime types in shaping coup attempts.\n\nThis study offers two potential contributions to the existing literature:\nfirstly, it highlights the significance of power dynamics within various regime\ntypes as critical factors influencing coup attempts; secondly, it demonstrates\nhow sample selection models can enhance our understanding of coup attempts by\ntaking into account the success rates of coups.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.05\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.05\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lccr}\n\\toprule\nCountry & Coup Attempted & Coup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nBolivia & 23 & 11 & 47.8\\% \\\\ \nArgentina & 20 & 7 & 35.0\\% \\\\ \nSudan & 17 & 6 & 35.3\\% \\\\ \nHaiti & 13 & 9 & 69.2\\% \\\\ \nVenezuela & 13 & 0 & 0.0\\% \\\\ \nIraq & 12 & 4 & 33.3\\% \\\\ \nSyria & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nThailand & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nEcuador & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nBurundi & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nGuatemala & 10 & 5 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 491 & 245 & 49.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GIC dataset}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe subsequent section of this paper delves into previous research on coups.\nFollowing that, in Part $3$, I present the research framework and propose\nhypotheses. Part 4 provides insights into the data and variables utilized in the\nstudy. The testing results are discussed in Part $5$, followed by the conclusion\nin Part $6$.\n\n## Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\n\nWhen contemplating a coup, plotters grapple with two crucial factors that also\noccupy coup scholars: ***disposition*** (why they take the risk) and\n***capability*** (whether they can succeed).\n\n### Disposition: Motivations for Coups\n\nCoup motivations can be categorized into three main types:\n\n**Personal Ambition:** The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth for\nthemselves, family, and close associates is a significant motivator.\n@wintrobe2019 distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on\ntheir use of power. Totalitarian leaders control every aspect of life, relishing\ntheir authority. Tinpot leaders, however, prioritize personal enrichment,\nindulging in extravagant lifestyles.\n\n**Purported National Interest:** Sometimes, coups are justified as rescuing a\nnation in crisis, upholding the constitution, or facilitating a democratic\ntransition. However, scepticism is warranted, as self-serving plotters often use\nsuch rhetoric. Nevertheless, legitimate cases exist. In 2010, a coup in Niger\nousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term. His\nactions, including dissolving the opposing Constitutional Court and calling a\nself-serving referendum, triggered a coup to protect the constitution\n[@ginsburg2019].\n\n**Self-Preservation:** In rare instances, coups serve as a last resort against\nimminent political persecution. Coup leaders might not seek power but fear\nelimination by the incumbent leader. Consequently, the coup becomes a pre-emptive\nstrike rather than an ambitious power grab. An example is Idi Amin, who, in 1971,\nstaged a coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin\nfrom his position as army commander-in-chief [@sudduth2017].\n\nWhile these motivations can arise in any regime, autocracies are more\nsusceptible, particularly for the latter two types. Stable democracies rarely\nface such constitutional crises or political persecutions that necessitate coups\nto protect them. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability,\neconomic downturns, and democratic backsliding which coup plotters can then use\nas a pretext to justify their actions.\n\nDespite these potential motivations, coups are relatively uncommon, occurring in\nonly $4\\%$ of country-years since 1950. This is because even the most determined\ncoup plotters require the capability to succeed, which we will explore in the\nnext section. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure.\n\n### Capability\n\nWhile there may be numerous ambitious political figures vying to seize supreme\npower for various reasons, only a select few have the opportunity to orchestrate\na coup. What truly determines their ability to launch a coup, however, is not\nmerely their willingness, but their capability. Yet, compared to the incumbent,\ncoup plotters naturally face disadvantages.\n\nFirstly, as previously mentioned, coups constitute illegal actions against\nincumbent leaders. To avoid the severe consequences of exposure or failure, coup\nplots must remain clandestine within a tightly knit core group. Coup plotters\ncannot openly recruit supporters to bolster their strength, while incumbents can\nopenly implement coup-proofing strategies to thwart coup attempts.\n\nSecondly, coup plotters are uncertain about how other ruling factions might react\nto their actions, particularly those capable of altering the balance of power.\nConversely, incumbent leaders possess a keen understanding of power dynamics and\ntake proactive measures to tilt the balance in their favour. Though unaware of\nspecific coup instigators, incumbent leaders are keenly aware of potential\nthreats and adapt accordingly to those who possess the capability to challenge\nthem.\n\nThirdly, coup plotters grapple with a loyalty dilemma and unreliable commitment\namong participants. The risks involved are considerable, and anticipated benefits\nare highly uncertain. Even in the event of a successful coup, there is no\nguarantee that promises made by coup leaders will be honoured. Additionally,\npost-coup purges often target capable assistants to pre-empt future challenges.\nConsequently, defecting to support the incumbent leader seems less risky and\noffers a safer bet with predictable rewards.\n\nGiven these challenges, rational coup plotters are unlikely to risk their lives\nfor a coup with low odds of success. Instead, they may opt to abandon their plans\nor bide their time until success becomes more feasible. Therefore, when coup\nperpetrators decide to take action, they must have meticulously assessed their\nchances of success and deemed the risk worthwhile.\n\nBut what constitutes a 'good enough' chance of success for coup plotters to\nproceed? Before delving into a theoretical framework to analyze this question,\nlet's first examine historical data to gain a rough idea. Surprisingly, previous\ncoups since 1950 suggest a rather satisfactory success rate, nearly $50\\%$, as\ndepicted in @tbl-coups.\n\n### Framework of coup success\n\nAn oft-cited framework, formalized by @leon2013 and @aidt2019, provides a\nstructured approach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by\nevaluating the anticipated benefits for coup plotters. This framework can be\nrepresented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Expected Payoff of coups} = \\sigma V_S + (1 - \\sigma)  (V_I - C)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq1}\n\nHere, $V_S$ represents the return of a successful coup, $V_I$ denotes the normal\nvalue paid by the incumbent in the status quo, $C$ signifies the cost of a failed\ncoup, and $\\sigma$ represents the probability of coup success. The condition for\nstaging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the\nexpected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging and simplifying the equation, we\nget:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma[V_S - V_I] > (1-\\sigma)C\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq2}\n\n@eq-eq2 implies that for @eq-eq1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from\nsuccessful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups. Both the\nmotivation (disposition) and chance of success (capability) are embedded within\n@eq-eq2. The motivation is reflected by the difference in benefits ($V_S - V_I$),\nwhile the opportunity is represented by the probability of success ($\\sigma$).\n\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying $V_S$\n(the value of a successful coup) and $C$ (the cost of failure) is difficult. The\nloss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of\nassuming leadership after a successful coup, are intangible concepts that defy\nprecise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup in Ghana[^2], the fate of the\ncoup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high likely to be killed if the\ncoup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds [@aidt2019].\n\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core\nlogic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the\nreturn and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive\nnature of precise values for $V_S$ and $C$, they can be treated as roughly equal.\nConsequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and compare these\nvalues precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from $V_S$​ and $C$ to the\nprobability of success ($\\sigma$), simplifying @eq-eq2 to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma > (1-\\sigma)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq3}\n\n@eq-eq3 suggests that, to hold @eq-eq2 true, a success probability greater than\n$50\\%$ is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat\nsupports this notion. As shown in @tbl-coups, the overall success rate is\n$49.9\\%$. While this falls short of the $50\\%$ threshold, it's important to\nconsider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily\nreflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly,\noutliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not\nprioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can\npropose our first hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: The primary determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of\n> success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least***\n> $50\\%$***.***\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup's\nsuccess, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary,\nthe core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the\nincumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage\nin this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n### Regime types and power dynamics\n\nWhen discussing the balance of power, the first aspect that springs to mind is\nmilitary prowess. It is evident that control over the military grants individuals\nthe upper hand in coup attempts. This elucidates why military coups often take\ncenter stage in coup discussions. In much of the literature on coups, the terms\n\"coup\" and \"military coup\" are frequently used interchangeably, as many scholars\nargue that coups are orchestrated by military personnel through the use or threat\nof armed forces. @powell2011 summarise 14 studies on coups, with half of them\nattributing coup attempts solely to 'the armed forces'. Consequently, most\nattention, both from academic researchers and political leaders, is focused on\nthe balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military\nfactions. Strategies such as \"Keeping the military content\" [@aidt2019, P. 15] or\n\"providing them with resources\" [@huntington1991democratization, P. 252] have\nbeen proposed to mitigate military intervention. Many coup-proofing strategies,\ninformed by empirical research, aim to either decrease the military's inclination\nto stage coups or erect barriers to their success. For instance, studies by\n@leon2013a suggest that nations with lower military spending as a percentage of\nGDP are more vulnerable to coups. Similarly, @powell2018 argue that increased\nmilitary expenditures may diminish the likelihood of coups among military\nfactions.\n\nHowever, previous studies have often oversimplified the intricate balance of\npower within military forces. They have frequently assumed that the military\noperates as a monolithic entity, uniformly and decisively. Such a notion fails to\ncapture the complexities of real-world dynamics.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the military is not always a unified entity.\nRegardless of its size, any military force is composed of various groups or\nfactions, each with its own chain of command. Within these factions, mutual\nsuspicion, competition, and vigilance are common, while moments of unity are\nrare. Due to the clandestine nature of coups and the need for secrecy, coup\nattempts are often orchestrated within small, tight-knit groups. Coup plotters\nare uncertain about the stances and intentions of other factions beforehand, and\nthey are particularly worried that once the coup is initiated, other factions may\nnot only refuse to support it but also actively oppose, intervene in, or even\nsuppress it. As in the attempted coup in Niger in 2021, which occurred just two\ndays before the new presidential inauguration, the military unit that staged the\ncoup was swiftly thwarted by Niger's security forces, resulting in the failure of\nthe coup within an hour[^3]. Therefore, the success of a coup heavily depends on\nthe reactions of other military factions [@geddes1999].\n\nMore importantly, the relationship between a government and its military varies\nsignificantly across different regime types. In democracies, civilian authority\nreigns supreme. The military is considered a national institution, bound by the\nconstitution rather than individual leaders, whether military or civilian. For\ninstance, the United States Armed Forces serve under the President's command but\nultimately answer to the Constitution, ensuring they remain politically neutral.\n\nIn contrast, non-democracies present a more complex picture. The lines of\nauthority are often either poorly defined in written documents or blatantly\ndisregarded by those in actual power. Identifying the true leader of the military\nhinges on the specific regime type. To explore this further, we will utilize the\nfoundational concepts outlined by by @geddes2014 (GWF), which categorise\nautocratic regimes based on leadership origins and decision-making factors. These\nregimes fall into three broad categories: military regimes, personalist regimes\n(including monarchies), and dominant-party regimes. Democracies will also be\nincluded in our analysis for comparative purposes.\n\n**Military Regimes**\n\nAs defined by GWF, military regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta\n– a group of military officers who control the regime's power structure,\nincluding leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the\nBrazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the\nSalvadoran regime (1948-1984) [@geddes1999]. Notably, political parties might\nstill exist within military regimes, but they typically act as mouthpieces for\nthe junta or align themselves with the military's directives to avoid being\ncategorized as dominant-party regimes. Additionally, while a junta may appoint a\nsenior officer as the head of state or utilize civilian administrators as\nintermediaries, the authority of these intermediaries over other officers remains\nlimited, differentiating military regimes from personalist ones.\n\n**Personalist Regimes**\n\nIn a typical personalist regime, absolute power rests with a single dictator.\nThis encompasses policy making, control over the military, and the authority to\nappoint top officials and successors. Personalist regimes often emerge under\ncharismatic leaders, particularly founding figures of newly independent nations.\nRegimes like Rafael Trujillo's in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin's\nin Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa's in the Central African Republic\n(1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule [@geddes1999]. In such regimes, political\nparties are either absent or completely subservient to the dictator. Importantly,\nthe dictator may or may not have a military background, but the military itself\nfalls under their control.\n\n**Dominant-Party Regimes**\n\nIn a dominant-party regime, supreme power resides within the ruling party, with\nthe leader acting as its representative and subject to its collective leadership.\nExamples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the\nRevolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern\nEuropean countries [@geddes1999]. The dominant party is a well-organized and\ndisciplined entity with its own ideology and political agenda used to unite and\nmobilize its members and supporters. While powerful leaders may emerge within\nsuch regimes, like Stalin in the Soviet Union (1924-1953) and Mao Zedong in China\n(1949-1976), they lack the absolute power to dismantle or replace the party\naltogether.\n\nAccording to @geddes1999, different factions within a regime – military officers,\nparty cadres in dominant-party systems, and members of cliques in personalist\nregimes – have distinct interests. For instance, professional soldiers prioritize\nmilitary survival and efficacy, party cadres seek to hold office, and members of\ncliques depend on supporting the incumbent leader for their own survival and\nrelationships. While their strategies may differ, all ruling groups ultimately\nprioritize self-preservation and advancement.\n\nThe key distinction between military, dominant-party, and personalist regimes\nlies in the unique balance of power established by each. This power dynamic\nemerges during the power seizure process. The most competent group, be it a\nmilitary junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically rises to power due\nto the demanding nature of seizing control. @sudduth2017 and @roessler2011\nanalyse the purging of co-conspirators after power seizures, arguing that these\npurges are more likely in the early stages of new regimes.\n\nFollowing these purges and any external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges\namong the factions. These regimes evolve into one of the three main types\ndiscussed earlier: military regimes, personalist regimes, and dominant-party\nregimes.\n\nThe differing power dynamics significantly impact the likelihood of coup\nattempts. According to @tbl-regimes, military regimes face the highest risk of\ncoups, representing only 5.6% of country-years yet accounting for over 22% of\ncoups. Personalist regimes follow, comprising 13% of country-years and\nresponsible for 23% of coups. Dominant-party regimes, however, have the lowest\nincidence among these three types, constituting 22.6% of country-years but\naccounting for only 16.7% of coups.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regimes .cell tbl-cap='Regime types and coups since 1950'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.025\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.025\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lrrrr}\n\\toprule\nRegime Type & Country Year & Share of Country Year & No of Coups & Percent of Coups \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nDemocracy & 5303 & 46.7\\% & 122 & 24.85\\% \\\\ \nDominant-Party & 2569 & 22.6\\% & 82 & 16.70\\% \\\\ \nPersonal & 1477 & 13.0\\% & 113 & 23.01\\% \\\\ \nMonarchy & 1056 & 9.3\\% & 25 & 5.09\\% \\\\ \nMilitary & 638 & 5.6\\% & 110 & 22.40\\% \\\\ \nOther & 322 & 2.8\\% & 39 & 7.94\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 11365 & 100\\% & 491 & 100\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Research Framework and Hypotheses\n\n## Data and Variables\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n[^1]: <https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/home.htm>, accessed on\n    2024-05-14\n\n[^2]: In the case of the Ghanaian coup, flight lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings\n    narrowly avoided execution after his initial failure, being freed by mutinous\n    soldiers.
