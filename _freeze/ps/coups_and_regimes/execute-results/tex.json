However, consensus remains elusive regarding why coups are more prevalent in certain countries while less so in others. Previous scholarship exploring the determinants of coup attempts has often overlooked the crucial aspect of coup success. Given the severe consequences of a failed coup, coup plotters are unlikely to proceed unless they perceive a high chance of success. Thus, the expected outcome of a coup—whether successful or unsuccessful—is not merely incidental but serves as a pivotal determinant of coup attempts. The decision to stage a coup is a self-selected variable contingent upon the anticipated success rate of coups. This study employs a sample selection model (specifically, a two-stage probit model) to elucidate why coups are more common in some autocratic countries but rare in others. I contend that coup attempts are largely shaped by the likelihood of coup success, which, in turn, hinges on the power dynamics between coup perpetrators and incumbents. These power dynamics are influenced by the regime type and their distinct responses to internal and external shocks.\nkeywords: [Coup, Autocracy, Regime types, Sample selection]\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nCoups occur with varying frequency across different countries, with some experiencing them more frequently than others.\nAccording to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC)[^1] dataset [@powell2011], Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between 1950 and 1984, while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar timeframe.\nHowever, Mexico's authoritarian period from 1917 to 2000 saw no coups at all.\nIn Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between 1955 and 2023, whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since 1950.\nSimilar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia.\nThe question of why coups occur more frequently in certain regions, countries, and periods, while being less common in others, has captivated scholars for decades.\nConsequently, scholars have delved into extensive research on coups.\nDespite numerous efforts in past studies to shed light on these disparities, a definitive model or set of determinants for analyzing coups remains elusive.\nAs highlighted by @gassebner2016, although approximately one hundred potential determinants of coups have been suggested, the fundamental question remains unanswered.\n\n[^1]: <https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/home.htm>, accessed on 2024-04-14\n\nHowever, despite extensive research by scholars, the impact of anticipated outcomes on coup initiation has not received sufficient attention.\nWhen analyzing the determinants of coups, it's crucial not to overlook the most significant characteristic of coups themselves.\nAs noted by @powell2011, coups are \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\"(P.252) Due to their illegality, the consequences of a failed coup could be severe, with perpetrators risking imprisonment, exile, or even death.\nIn some instances, the repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators.\n\nDespite the significant risks associated with coups, as shown in @tbl-coups since 1950, there have still been as many as 491 coups worldwide.\nFurthermore, more importantly, half of these coups have been successful.\nAt first glance, coups seem to be a high-success-rate, high-reward political venture and speculation.\nHowever, compared to over $12,000$ country-years since 1950, the occurrence of 491 coups appears rather rare, accounting for less than $4\\%$.\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate indicate that the initiation of coups is highly selective.\nIn other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring depends greatly on its potential success rate.\nCoup plotters carefully assess their chances before staging a coup.\nIf they decide to proceed, it suggests that the conditions are relatively ripe, hence the fifty-fifty success rate.\nPlans with immature conditions and low chances of success are automatically filtered out.\nFundamentally, launching a coup is not like participating in a general election, where failure in one election allows for another attempt in the next election.\nA coup is a high-stakes gamble where success brings substantial rewards, while failure may result in martyrdom.\nFailure, put differently, means permanent and absolute defeat.\nFurthermore, the outcomes of coups are typically decided within a matter of days, sometimes even mere hours.\nUnlike prolonged conflicts where victories or defeats may shift over time, the success of a coup is often sealed at its inception.\nEvery detail must be meticulously planned and arranged beforehand.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts'}\n:::

role in shaping coup attempts.\nThis study employs a sample selection model to examine the factors affecting the success rates of coups and, consequently, the likelihood of coup attempts.\nI posit that the power dynamics among coup perpetrators, incumbents, and other ruling elites are pivotal in determining the success of coups.\nThese dynamics are largely contingent on regime types, highlighting the pivotal role of regime types in shaping coup attempts.\n\nThis study offers two potential contributions to the existing literature: firstly, it highlights the significance of power dynamics within various regime types as critical factors influencing coup attempts; secondly, it demonstrates how sample selection models can enhance our understanding of coup attempts by taking into account the success rates of coups.\n\nThe subsequent section of this paper delves into previous research on coups.\nFollowing that, in Part 3, I present the research framework and propose hypotheses.\nPart 4 provides insights into the data and variables utilized in the study.\nThe testing results are discussed in Part 5, followed by the conclusion in Part 6.\n\n## Theory\n\nThe majority of studies on coup risks primarily focus on identifying the causes and determinants of coup attempts.\nAs mentioned earlier, despite the multitude of potential determinants proposed—numbering around one hundred [@gassebner2016]—only a few studies have discussed both coup attempts and coup success.\nMoreover, even fewer of these studies have specifically analysed the possible deterrent effect of coup outcomes on coup attempts.\nAdditionally, the dynamics of power balance among various types of regimes are often overlooked in previous studies.\n\nCoup plotters undertake coups with the intention of achieving certain benefits.\nDespite the high risks involved, if the anticipated gains from a coup outweigh the risks, plotters may still proceed with their plans.\nSo, how can we quantify these anticipated gains?\nThe commonly referenced framework for assessing the expected benefits of coup plotters has been formalized by @leon2013 as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Expected Payoff} = \\sigma V_S + (1 - \\sigma)  (V_I - C)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq1}\n\nHere, $V_S$ represents the return of a successful coup, $V_I$ denotes the normal value paid by the incumbent in the status quo, $C$ signifies the cost of the failed coup, and $\\sigma$ represents the probability of coup success.\nBy rearranging the equation, we can derive:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma(V_S - V_I) > (1-\\sigma)C\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq2}\n\nBased on these two equations, @aidt2019 suggests that a coup is likely to be initiated when the anticipated benefits of a successful coup outweigh the potential costs of failure.\nit raises practical challenges in quantifying the values of $V_S$ and $C$, which are not easily measurable in real-world terms.\nHow can we measure the cost of losing freedom, life, even beloved family members if the coup fails.\nHow can we measure the value of being the leader of a country if the coup succeeds?\nThere is no such a market.\n\nAs $V_S$ and $C$ are impossible to measure in value, it does not mean the equations is useless.\nFor one thing, the underlying logic of the equation remains robust and offers a valuable framework for comprehending the decision-making dynamics of coup plotters.\nFor the other, there is no need to measure how much $V_S$ and $C$ are in exact value.\nOne thing is for sure: both are priceless and we can take them rough equal.\nFurthermore, coup plotters are motivated by more than just economic gains or losses.\nWhich means, coup plotters would not care much about $V_S$ or $C$.\nAs long as the coup succeeds, they win.\nThis implies that in @eq-eq2, $V_S-V_I$ and $C$ can be ignored.\nThe factor that only matters is the probability of success of the coup.\n\nDrawing from these equations, @aidt2019 suggests that the decision to initiate a coup hinges on whether the expected benefits of a successful coup outweigh the potential costs of failure.\nHowever, quantifying the values of $V_S$ and $C$ presents practical challenges, as they are not possibly measurable in real-world terms.\nHow can one measure the cost of losing freedom, life, or even beloved family members if a coup fails?\nSimilarly, how can the value of assuming leadership of a country be quantified if the coup succeeds?\nThese are not commodities that can be traded in a market.\n\nWhile $V_S$ and $C$ may be impossible to measure in precise terms, this does not render the equations useless.\nFirstly, the underlying logic of the equations remains robust and provides a valuable framework for understanding the decision-making process of coup plotters.\nSecondly, there is no need for precise measurements of $V_S$ and $C$.\nIt is sufficient to consider them as invaluable, with both potentially considered roughly equal.\nAdditionally, coup plotters are driven by factors beyond mere economic gains or losses.\nAs long as the coup succeeds, they win anyway.\nThis suggests that in @eq-eq2, the values of $V_S-V_I$ and $C$ can be disregarded, and the focus can solely be on the probability of the coup's success.\n\nThere are three dimensions when we analyse coup outcomes.\nThe first dimension is straightforward: why some coups succeed while others fail [@quinlivan1999; @kebschull1994].\nThe second dimension focuses on the potential influences: what happens after failed coups and successful coups.\nIn particular, whether it helps the shifts towards democracy following successful coups.\nThis debate is exemplified by the arguments between Michael Miller [@miller2016] and Derpanopoulos, Frantz & Gedde [@derpanopoulos2016; @derpanopoulos2017].\nHowever, the third dimension, which explores how the expected success of coups influences coup attempts, remains underexplored.\n\nAmong the limited discussions on the influence of coup success on coup attempts, @powell2012 utilizes a selection model with global data spanning 1961 to 2000.\nPowell's findings suggest that coup-proofing strategies, such as balancing and providing resources to the military, reduce the likelihood of coups but increase their chances of success.\n\nHowever, few of the aforementioned studies have explored the interdependence between coup attempts and coup success.\nIn other words, as demonstrated in @eq-eq1 and @eq-eq2, they do not consider the likelihood of coup success as a primary determinant of coup attempts.\n\nIf the likelihood of coup success is predetermined, what factors influence or potentially determine the success rates of coups?\nMuch attention is understandably given to military strength, as it is believed that the control of military forces often determines the success of coups.\nConsequently, coup-proofing strategies are designed to either decrease the inclination of military forces to stage coups or to erect barriers that impede their success.\nFor instance, studies by @leon2013a suggest that coups are more probable in nations where military spending as a percentage of GDP is low.\n@powell2018 also argue that increased military expenditures may decrease the propensity for coups among military factions.\nHowever, as @powell2012 posits, while measures aimed at pacifying the military may diminish the likelihood of a coup being attempted, greater military resources may simultaneously enhance the probability of a coup's success.\n\nIn addition to military factors, research delves into other determinants as well.\nFor instance, @bell2016 contends that democracies are less susceptible to coups, yet coup attempts against democracies are more likely to succeed.\n\n## Research Framework and Hypotheses\n\n## Data and Variables\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n##
