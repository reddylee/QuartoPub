However, the results of post-coup events play a crucial role in the decision-making process of coup attempts, either attracting potential plotters with significant benefits or deterring them with substantial costs. Inspired by the observed success rates of coups, this study posits that the expected outcomes of a coup are pivotal determinants of coup attempts. Utilizing the double probit with sample selection model, this research aims to elucidate why coups are more prevalent in certain autocratic countries while being rare in others. The findings suggest that, influenced by the distinct power dynamics between coup perpetrators and incumbents, coups are more likely to occur in military and personalist regimes compared to dominant-party regimes.\n\nkeywords: [Coup, Autocracy, Regime types, Sample selection]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nCoups occur with varying frequency across different countries, with some\nexperiencing them more frequently than others. According to the Global Instances\nof Coups (GIC)[^1] dataset [@powell2011], Latin American countries such as\nBolivia witnessed 23 coups\nbetween $1950$ and $1984$, while Argentina experienced\n20 during a similar time\nframe. However, Mexico's authoritarian period from $1917$ to $2000$ saw no coups\nat all. In Africa, Sudan endured\n17 coups between $1955$ and\n$2023$, whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since $1950$. Similar\npatterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia. The question of why\ncoups occur more frequently in certain regions, countries, and periods, while\nbeing less common in others, has captivated scholars for decades. Consequently,\nscholars have delved into extensive research on coups. Despite numerous efforts\nin past studies to shed light on these disparities, a definitive model or set of\ndeterminants for analysing coups remains elusive. As highlighted by\n@gassebner2016, although approximately one hundred potential determinants of\ncoups have been suggested, the fundamental question remains unanswered.\n\nHowever, despite extensive research by scholars, the impact of anticipated\noutcomes on coup initiation has not received sufficient attention. When analysing\nthe determinants of coups, it is crucial not to overlook the most significant\ncharacteristic of coups themselves. As defined by @powell2011, coups are \"illegal\nand overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to\nunseat the sitting executive.\"[@powell2011, P.252]. Due to their illegality, the\nconsequences of a failed coup could be severe, with perpetrators risking\nimprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, the repercussions extend\nto the families of the coup perpetrators.\n\nDespite the significant risks associated with coups, as shown in @tbl-coups since\n$1950$, there have still been as many as 491 coups worldwide.\nFurthermore, more importantly, half of these coups have been successful. At first\nglance, coups seem to be a high-success-rate, high-reward political venture and\nspeculation. However, compared to over $12,000$ country-years since $1950$, the\noccurrence of 491 coups appears rather rare, accounting for less than\n$4\\%$ [@powell2011].\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coups .cell tbl-cap='Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.05\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.05\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lccr}\n\\toprule\nCountry & Coup Attempted & Coup Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nBolivia & 23 & 11 & 47.8\\% \\\\ \nArgentina & 20 & 7 & 35.0\\% \\\\ \nSudan & 17 & 6 & 35.3\\% \\\\ \nHaiti & 13 & 9 & 69.2\\% \\\\ \nVenezuela & 13 & 0 & 0.0\\% \\\\ \nIraq & 12 & 4 & 33.3\\% \\\\ \nSyria & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nThailand & 12 & 8 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nEcuador & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nBurundi & 11 & 5 & 45.5\\% \\\\ \nGuatemala & 10 & 5 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 491 & 245 & 49.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: GIC dataset}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate indicate that the initiation of\ncoups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring\ndepends greatly on its potential success rate. Coup plotters carefully assess\ntheir chances before staging a coup. If they decide to proceed, it suggests that\nthe conditions are relatively ripe, hence the fifty-fifty success rate. Plans\nwith immature conditions and low chances of success will be filtered out.\nFundamentally, launching a coup is not like participating in a general election,\nwhere failure in one election allows for another attempt in the next election. A\ncoup is a high-stakes gamble where success brings substantial rewards, while\nfailure may result in martyrdom. Failure, put differently, means permanent and\nabsolute defeat. Furthermore, the outcomes of coups are typically decided within\na matter of days, sometimes even mere hours. Unlike prolonged conflicts where\nvictories or defeats may shift over time, the success of a coup is often sealed\nat its inception. Every detail must be meticulously planned and arranged\nbeforehand.\n\nHence, the factors influencing the success rates of coups play a significant role\nin shaping coup attempts. This study employs a sample selection model to examine\nthe factors affecting the success rates of coups and, consequently, the\nlikelihood of coup attempts. I posit that the power dynamics among coup\nperpetrators, incumbents, and other ruling elites are pivotal in determining the\nsuccess of coups. These dynamics are largely contingent on regime types,\nhighlighting the pivotal role of regime types in shaping coup attempts.\n\nThis study offers two potential contributions to the existing literature:\nfirstly, it highlights the significance of power dynamics within various regime\ntypes as critical factors influencing coup attempts; secondly, it demonstrates\nhow sample selection models can enhance our understanding of coup attempts by\ntaking into account the success rates of coups.\n\nThe subsequent section of this paper explores the dynamics of coup attempts and\ntheir outcomes. In Part 3, I detail the research design, outlining the\nmethodology and variables used in the analysis. Part 4 presents and discusses the\nempirical findings. Finally, Part 5 concludes the study, summarizing the key\ninsights and their implications.\n\n## Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\n\nWhen contemplating a coup, plotters grapple with two crucial factors that also\noccupy coup scholars: ***disposition*** (why they take the risk) and\n***capability*** (whether they can succeed).\n\n### Disposition: Motivations for Coups\n\nCoup motivations can be categorized into three main types:\n\n**Personal Ambition:** The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth for\nthemselves, family, and close associates is a significant motivator.\n@wintrobe2019 distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on\ntheir use of power. Totalitarian leaders control every aspect of life, relishing\ntheir authority. Tinpot leaders, however, prioritize personal enrichment,\nindulging in extravagant lifestyles.\n\n**Purported National Interest:** Sometimes, coups are justified as rescuing a\nnation in crisis, upholding the constitution, or facilitating a democratic\ntransition. However, scepticism is warranted, as self-serving plotters often use\nsuch rhetoric. Nevertheless, legitimate cases exist. In 2010, a coup in Niger\nousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term. His\nactions, including dissolving the opposing Constitutional Court and calling a\nself-serving referendum, triggered a coup to protect the constitution\n[@ginsburg2019].\n\n**Self-Preservation:** In rare instances, coups serve as a last resort against\nimminent political persecution. Coup leaders might not seek power but fear\nelimination by the incumbent leader. Consequently, the coup becomes a pre-emptive\nstrike rather than an ambitious power grab. An example is Idi Amin, who, in 1971,\nstaged a coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin\nfrom his position as army commander-in-chief [@sudduth2017].\n\nWhile these motivations can arise in any regime, autocracies are more\nsusceptible, particularly for the latter two types. Stable democracies rarely\nface such constitutional crises or political persecutions that necessitate coups\nto protect them. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability,\neconomic downturns, and democratic backsliding which coup plotters can then use\nas a pretext to justify their actions.\n\nDespite these potential motivations, coups are relatively uncommon, occurring in\nonly $4\\%$ of country-years since 1950. This is because even the most determined\ncoup plotters require the capability to succeed, which we will explore in the\nnext section. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure.\n\n### Capability\n\nWhile there may be numerous ambitious political figures vying to seize supreme\npower for various reasons, only a select few have the opportunity to orchestrate\na coup. What truly determines their ability to launch a coup, however, is not\nmerely their willingness, but their capability. Yet, compared to the incumbent,\ncoup plotters naturally face disadvantages.\n\nFirstly, as previously mentioned, coups constitute illegal actions against\nincumbent leaders. To avoid the severe consequences of exposure or failure, coup\nplots must remain clandestine within a tightly knit core group. Coup plotters\ncannot openly recruit supporters to bolster their strength, while incumbents can\nopenly implement coup-proofing strategies to thwart coup attempts.\n\nSecondly, coup plotters are uncertain about how other ruling factions might react\nto their actions, particularly those capable of altering the balance of power.\nConversely, incumbent leaders possess a keen understanding of power dynamics and\ntake proactive measures to tilt the balance in their favour. Though unaware of\nspecific coup instigators, incumbent leaders are keenly aware of potential\nthreats and adapt accordingly to those who possess the capability to challenge\nthem.\n\nThirdly, coup plotters grapple with a loyalty dilemma and unreliable commitment\namong participants. The risks involved are considerable, and anticipated benefits\nare highly uncertain. Even in the event of a successful coup, there is no\nguarantee that promises made by coup leaders will be honoured. Additionally,\npost-coup purges often target capable assistants to pre-empt future challenges.\nConsequently, defecting to support the incumbent leader seems less risky and\noffers a safer bet with predictable rewards.\n\nGiven these challenges, rational coup plotters are unlikely to risk their lives\nfor a coup with low odds of success. Instead, they may opt to abandon their plans\nor bide their time until success becomes more feasible. Therefore, when coup\nperpetrators decide to take action, they must have meticulously assessed their\nchances of success and deemed the risk worthwhile.\n\nBut what constitutes a 'good enough' chance of success for coup plotters to\nproceed? Before delving into a theoretical framework to analyze this question,\nlet's first examine historical data to gain a rough idea. Surprisingly, previous\ncoups since 1950 suggest a rather satisfactory success rate, nearly $50\\%$, as\ndepicted in @tbl-coups.\n\n### Framework of coup success\n\nAn oft-cited framework [@gassebner2016; @aidt2019] provides a structured approach\nto assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the\nanticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of coups can be\nrepresented by the equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq1}\n\nHere, $\\mathbf B$ represents the return of a successful coup, $\\mathbf C$\nsignifies the cost of a failed coup, and $p$ represents the probability of coup\nsuccess. The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is\npositive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the\nequation, we get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B > (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq2}\n\n@eq-eq2 implies that for @eq-eq1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from\nsuccessful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups.\n\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying\n$\\mathbf B$ (the value of a successful coup) and $\\mathbf C$ (the cost of\nfailure) is difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed\ncoup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after a successful coup, are\nintangible concepts that defy precise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup\nin Ghana[^2], the fate of the coup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high\nlikely to be killed if the coup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds.\n\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core\nlogic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the\nreturn and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive\nnature of precise values for $\\mathbf B$ and $\\mathbf C$, they can be treated as\nroughly equal. Consequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and\ncompare these values precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from $\\mathbf B$\nand $\\mathbf C$, to the probability of success ($p$), simplifying @eq-eq2 to:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np > (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq3}\n\n@eq-eq3 suggests that, to hold @eq-eq2 true, a success probability greater than\n$50\\%$ is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat\nsupports this notion. As shown in @tbl-coups, the overall success rate is\n$49.9\\%$. While this falls short of the $50\\%$ threshold, it's important to\nconsider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily\nreflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly,\noutliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not\nprioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can\npropose our first hypothesis:\n\n> ***H1: The primary determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of\n> success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.***\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup's\nsuccess, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary,\nthe core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the\nincumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage\nin this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n### Regime types and power dynamics\n\nWhen discussing the balance of power, the first aspect that springs to mind is\nmilitary prowess. It is evident that control over the military grants individuals\nthe upper hand in coup attempts. This elucidates why military coups often take\ncenter stage in coup discussions. In much of the literature on coups, the terms\n\"coup\" and \"military coup\" are frequently used interchangeably, as many scholars\nargue that coups are orchestrated by military personnel through the use or threat\nof armed forces. @powell2011 summarise 14 studies on coups, with half of them\nattributing coup attempts solely to 'the armed forces'. Consequently, most\nattention, both from academic researchers and political leaders, is focused on\nthe balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military\nfactions. Strategies such as \"Keeping the military content\" [@aidt2019, P. 15] or\n\"providing them with resources\" [@huntington1991democratization, P. 252] have\nbeen proposed to mitigate military intervention. Many coup-proofing strategies,\ninformed by empirical research, aim to either decrease the military's inclination\nto stage coups or erect barriers to their success. For instance, studies by\n@leon2013a suggest that nations with lower military spending as a percentage of\nGDP are more vulnerable to coups. Similarly, @powell2018 argue that increased\nmilitary expenditures may diminish the likelihood of coups among military\nfactions.\n\nHowever, previous studies have often oversimplified the intricate balance of\npower within military forces. They have frequently assumed that the military\noperates as a monolithic entity, uniformly and decisively. Such a notion fails to\ncapture the complexities of real-world dynamics.\n\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the military is not always a unified entity.\nRegardless of its size, any military force is composed of various groups or\nfactions, each with its own chain of command. Within these factions, mutual\nsuspicion, competition, and vigilance are common, while moments of unity are\nrare. Due to the clandestine nature of coups and the need for secrecy, coup\nattempts are often orchestrated within small, tight-knit groups. Coup plotters\nare uncertain about the stances and intentions of other factions beforehand, and\nthey are particularly worried that once the coup is initiated, other factions may\nnot only refuse to support it but also actively oppose, intervene in, or even\nsuppress it. As in the attempted coup in Niger in 2021, which occurred just two\ndays before the new presidential inauguration, the military unit that staged the\ncoup was swiftly thwarted by Niger's security forces, resulting in the failure of\nthe coup within an hour[^3]. Therefore, the success of a coup heavily depends on\nthe reactions of other military factions [@geddes1999].\n\nMore importantly, the relationship between a government and its military varies\nsignificantly across different regime types. In democracies, civilian authority\nreigns supreme. The military is considered a national institution, bound by the\nconstitution rather than individual leaders, whether military or civilian. For\ninstance, the United States Armed Forces serve under the President's command but\nultimately answer to the Constitution, ensuring they remain politically neutral.\n\nIn contrast, non-democracies present a more complex picture. The lines of\nauthority are often either poorly defined in written documents or blatantly\ndisregarded by those in actual power. Identifying the true leader of the military\nhinges on the specific regime type. To explore this further, we will utilize the\nfoundational concepts outlined by by @geddes2014 (GWF), which categorise\nautocratic regimes based on leadership origins and decision-making factors. These\nregimes fall into three broad categories: military regimes, personalist regimes,\nand dominant-party regimes. Democracies and monarchies will also be included in\nour analysis for comparative purposes.\n\n**Military Regimes**\n\nAs defined by GWF, military regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta\n– a group of military officers who control the regime's power structure,\nincluding leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the\nBrazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the\nSalvadoran regime (1948-1984) [@geddes1999]. Notably, political parties might\nstill exist within military regimes, but they typically act as mouthpieces for\nthe junta or align themselves with the military's directives to avoid being\ncategorized as dominant-party regimes. Additionally, while a junta may appoint a\nsenior officer as the head of state or utilize civilian administrators as\nintermediaries, the authority of these intermediaries over other officers remains\nlimited, differentiating military regimes from personalist ones.\n\n**Personalist Regimes**\n\nIn a typical personalist regime, absolute power rests with a single dictator.\nThis encompasses policy making, control over the military, and the authority to\nappoint top officials and successors. Personalist regimes often emerge under\ncharismatic leaders, particularly founding figures of newly independent nations.\nRegimes like Rafael Trujillo's in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin's\nin Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa's in the Central African Republic\n(1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule [@geddes1999]. In such regimes, political\nparties are either absent or completely subservient to the dictator. Importantly,\nthe dictator may or may not have a military background, but the military itself\nfalls under their control.\n\n**Dominant-Party Regimes**\n\nIn a dominant-party regime, supreme power resides within the ruling party, with\nthe leader acting as its representative and subject to its collective leadership.\nExamples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the\nRevolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern\nEuropean countries [@geddes1999]. The dominant party is a well-organized and\ndisciplined entity with its own ideology and political agenda used to unite and\nmobilize its members and supporters. While powerful leaders may emerge within\nsuch regimes, like Stalin in the Soviet Union (1924-1953) and Mao Zedong in China\n(1949-1976), they lack the absolute power to dismantle or replace the party\naltogether.\n\nAccording to @geddes1999, different factions within a regime – military officers,\nparty cadres in dominant-party systems, and members of cliques in personalist\nregimes – have distinct interests. For instance, professional soldiers prioritize\nmilitary survival and efficacy, party cadres seek to hold office, and members of\ncliques depend on supporting the incumbent leader for their own survival and\nrelationships. While their strategies may differ, all ruling groups ultimately\nprioritize self-preservation and advancement.\n\nThe key distinction between military, dominant-party, and personalist regimes\nlies in the unique balance of power established by each. This power dynamic\nemerges during the power seizure process. The most competent group, be it a\nmilitary junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically rises to power due\nto the demanding nature of seizing control. @sudduth2017 and @roessler2011\nanalyse the purging of co-conspirators after power seizures, arguing that these\npurges are more likely in the early stages of new regimes.\n\nFollowing internal purges and external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges\namong the factions within a regime, typically solidifying into one of three main\ntypes: military regimes, personalist regimes, or dominant-party regimes.\n\nDominant-party regimes are the most stable due to their institutionalized\nstructure. A dominant party is a highly organized group with shared political\nbeliefs, goals, and ideologies. This shared ideology fosters internal cohesion\nand a long-term vision, resulting in a robust structure with no single individual\nwielding absolute power. The military force aligns with the party itself rather\nthan individual leaders, contributing significantly to greater regime stability\ncompared to personalist or military regimes. Dominant-party regimes also manage\nleadership succession more effectively, as they typically regulate the process\nand enforce term limits. As demonstrated by @frantz2017, 97% of country-years in\ndominant-party regimes have formalized institutional succession rules, compared\nto 77% in personalist regimes and a mere 59% in military regimes.\n\nPersonalist regimes also exhibit a degree of stability, as dictators usually\nemerge from intense internal and external competition, with the most competent,\ntough, and powerful individuals ultimately prevailing. Potential challengers have\noften been purged, resulting in a relatively stable status quo within the\ndictator's close circle. However, personalist regimes are vulnerable due to the\nsudden death of incumbents. Rarely is there a universally accepted successor\nduring the chaos of power transitions, as incumbent dictators often purge\npotential rivals. This uncertainty can trigger coups. Thus, while personalist\nregimes maintain relative stability as long as succession is not an immediate\nissue.\n\nIn contrast, military regimes are typically the least stable. These regimes often\nrule through a junta, where power is shared equally among members. Mistrust and\nsuspicion are common, leading to frequent conflicts over benefits and policies.\nWithout a single authority figure, resolving these conflicts is challenging, as\nno member is willing to concede, and no senior authority can enforce resolutions.\nFor example, General Augusto Pinochet was chosen to lead the junta in Chile after\nthe 1973 coup because his colleagues saw him as a safe choice due to his\nprofessionalism, respect for rules, and uncharismatic demeanor\n[@arriagadaherrera1988]. Although Pinochet later surprised them, this example\nillustrates that juntas are generally unstable leadership groups.\n\nThese differing power dynamics significantly impact the likelihood of coup\nattempts. Military regimes, in particular, have an inherent predisposition\ntowards coups, as junta members typically command their own military factions,\neliminating the need to organize an army for a coup. According to @tbl-regimes,\nmilitary regimes face the highest risk, representing only 5.6% of country-years\nyet accounting for over 22% of coups. Personalist regimes follow, with 23% of\ncoups despite comprising only 13% of country-years. Dominant-party regimes, with\ntheir stronger institutions and unified leadership, have the lowest incidence of\ncoups, constituting 22.6% of country-years but responsible for only 16.7% of\ncoups.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regimes .cell tbl-cap='Regime types and coups since 1950'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lrrrrr}\n\\toprule\nRegime Type & Country Year & Share & Num of Coups & Percent of Coups & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nDemocracy & 5303 & 46.7\\% & 122 & 24.8\\% & 51.6\\% \\\\ \nDominant-Party & 2569 & 22.6\\% & 82 & 16.7\\% & 53.7\\% \\\\ \nPersonal & 1477 & 13.0\\% & 113 & 23.0\\% & 44.2\\% \\\\ \nMonarchy & 1056 & 9.3\\% & 25 & 5.1\\% & 56.0\\% \\\\ \nMilitary & 638 & 5.6\\% & 110 & 22.4\\% & 48.2\\% \\\\ \nOther & 322 & 2.8\\% & 39 & 7.9\\% & 53.8\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 11365 & 100.0\\% & 491 & 100.0\\% & 49.9\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n> ***H2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are more prone\n> to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes are the\n> least likely to experience coups among the three.***\n\n## Research Design\n\n### Double probit with sample selection model\n\nTo account for the determinants of coup attempts, this study utilizes a sample\nselection model [@heckman1979]. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes,\nsuccess rates tend to converge around 50% (@tbl-regimes). This convergence cannot\nbe attributed to chance and suggests that coup attempts are strategically planned\nand self-selected, targeting situations with a perceived high chance of success.\nConsequently, a standard regression model would yield biased results. Therefore,\nwe use a double `probit` model with sample selection, as employed by @powell2012,\nfor empirical analysis. The first stage (selection equation) examines the\nprobability that a regime experiences a coup attempt, while the second stage\n(outcome equation) evaluates the probability of the success of those coups.\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are regime types, as previously discussed.\nControl variables are included in $\\mathbf{XB}$. The selection equation (first\nstage) models the probability that a coup attempt occurs and can be expressed as\nfollows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1^*=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XA} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq4}\n\nHere, ${y_1}^*$ is an unobserved variable, which may be known to coup plotters.\n$Regime_i$ is a categorical variable (*military*, *personalist*, or\n*dominant-party*). ***XB*** captures other control variables, such as the\neconomic crisis index, previous coups, military expenditure, etc.\n\nThe observed binary outcome $\\mathbf{y_1}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 &\\text{if $y_1^*>0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_1^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\\\nIn the first stage, if $y_1^*\\le0$, no coup attempt occurs in a given\ncountry-year, indicating that the unobserved variable does not reach the\nthreshold. If $y_1^*>0$, at least one coup attempt is made in a country-year,\nindicating that the unobserved variable surpasses the threshold. The probability\nis expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_1 =1)&=Prob(y_{1}^*>0) \\\\\n&=\\Phi(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XA})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq4a}\n\nSimilarly, the outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup\nattempt is successful, given that it occurs:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2^*=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XB} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq5}\n\nThe observed outcome $y_2$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2 = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 &\\text{if $y_2^*>0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_2^*\\le0$ (coup fails)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe probability equations is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_2=1|y_1 =1)=\\Phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XB})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq5a}\n\n### Variables\n\n#### Dependent variable\n\nTo test our hypotheses, we use coup attempts and outcomes data from @powell2011\nas the dependent variable. Successful coups are those in which the incumbent is\nremoved from office for more than seven days. The dataset spans from 1950 to\n2023, accounting for 491 coup attempts, of which 245 were successful. Descriptive\nstatistics are presented in @tbl-coups and @tbl-regimes.\n\n#### Independent variables\n\nThe primary independent variable in our analysis is the regime type. We follow\nthe categories defined by @geddes2014 (GWF). Our main focus is on military,\npersonalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracy and monarchy included as\nreference categories. Descriptive statistics are presented in @tbl-regimes.\n\n#### Control variables\n\nIn selecting control variables, we draw on the research by @gassebner2016, who\ntest the robustness of 66 factors proposed in the empirical literature using a\nmonthly sample of 164 countries from 1952 to 2011. They find that slow economic\ngrowth rates, previous coup experiences, and other forms of political violence\nare particularly conducive to inciting coups. Therefore, our main control\nvariables are economic performance, political violence, and the number of\nprevious coups.\n\n**Economic performance:** We use the current-trend ($CT$) ratio developed by\n@krishnarajan2019 to measure economic performance. This metric calculates the\nratio between the current level of gross domestic product per capita (GDP/cap)\nand the average GDP/cap level of the previous five years. For a country $i$ at\nyear $t$, the $CT$ ratio is calculated as follows: $$\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince a given year's situation is primarily determined by the previous year, the\nvariable is lagged by one year. The GDP per capita (in constant 2017\ninternational dollars, PPP) is sourced from the V-Dem dataset provided by\n@fariss2022.\n\n**Violence:** The violence index captures all types of violence and wars\n(internal or interstate), indicating the stability of the regime. This data is\nsourced from the Major Episodes of Political Violence [@marshall2005current].\n\n**Previous coups:** This variable captures the number of previous coups in each\ncountry. In the double probit with sample selection model, the second-stage model\ncannot be identical to the first-stage model. Therefore, the first-stage model\nincludes the number of previous coups, while the second-stage does not. Previous\ncoups may have a greater impact on coup attempts, while once a coup is launched,\nthe number of previous coups might not significantly explain the outcome.\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\n### Interpretation and Discussion\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{table}[!htbp] \\centering \n  \\caption{Sample Selection Model of Regime Types and Coups, 1950-2019} \n  \\label{results} \n\\begin{tabular}{@{\\extracolsep{50pt}}lcc} \n\\\\[-1.8ex]\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n & Coup Attempts & Coup Outcome \\\\ \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & (1) & (2)\\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n Constant & $-$0.146 & $-$1.519$^{**}$ \\\\ \n  & (0.234) & (0.627) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Regime: Democracy & 0.072 & 0.057 \\\\ \n  & (0.071) & (0.160) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Military & 0.732$^{***}$ & 0.497 \\\\ \n  & (0.084) & (0.330) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Monarchy & 0.353$^{***}$ & 0.177 \\\\ \n  & (0.120) & (0.278) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist & 0.344$^{***}$ & 0.028 \\\\ \n  & (0.075) & (0.289) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Economic trend & $-$1.438$^{***}$ & 0.135 \\\\ \n  & (0.223) & (1.259) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n  GDP per capita & $-$0.031$^{***}$ & $-$0.027$^{**}$ \\\\ \n  & (0.002) & (0.012) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Political violence & 0.048$^{***}$ & 0.029 \\\\ \n  & (0.014) & (0.026) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Previous coups & $-$0.001$^{***}$ &  \\\\ \n  & (0.0002) &  \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \nObservations & 9,605 & 9,605 \\\\ \nLog Likelihood & $-$1,665.655 & $-$1,665.655 \\\\ \n$\\rho$ & 0.709  (0.445) & 0.709  (0.445) \\\\ \n\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n\\textit{Note:}  & \\multicolumn{2}{r}{$^{*}$p$<$0.1; $^{**}$p$<$0.05; $^{***}$p$<$0.01} \\\\ \n\\end{tabular} \n\\end{table} \n\n\n\nUsing the R package `sampleSelection` [@sampleSelection], the findings from the\ndouble probit model, as presented in Table \\ref{results}, provide valuable\ninsights into the dynamics of coup attempts and their likelihood of success\nacross different regime types:\n\nAs hypothesized, both the coefficients for military and personalist regimes are\npositive and significant at the 1% level, indicating a higher likelihood of\nexperiencing coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes, holding other\nfactors constant. This higher propensity for coup attempts in military and\npersonalist regimes aligns with our hypothesis that these regimes face distinct\ninternal power dynamics, increasing the likelihood of coup attempts.\n\nAll control variables are statistically significant at the 1% level. As expected,\nbetter economic performance and higher levels of GDP per capita help reduce the\nrisk of coups. Surprisingly, more previous coups appear to reduce the risk of\ncoups, but this finding is not substantially significant. This indicates that\neven after accounting for various relevant factors, regime type remains a\ncritical determinant of coup likelihood. This underscores the robustness of our\nfindings and the importance of regime type in understanding coup dynamics.\n\nIn the outcome equation, most variables are not significant at the 5% level. This\nsupports our hypothesis that coup attempts are highly selective at the attempt\nstage, thereby diminishing the influence of these variables on the coup outcome.\nHigher GDP per capita is negatively associated with the likelihood of coup\nsuccess at the 5% significance level. This suggests that better economic\nconditions may bolster support for incumbent leaders, thereby reducing the\nchances of a successful coup against them.\n\nThe correlation coefficient ($\\rho$) between the error terms of the selection and\noutcome equations is 0.7086 with a p-value of 0.111. Although positive, this\ncorrelation is not statistically significant, indicating that there may not be a\nstrong correlation between the errors in the selection and outcome equations.\nThis suggests that the selection bias might not be as severe as initially\nhypothesized.\n\nOverall, the regression results indicate that the sample selection model is a\nwell-specified choice for this research. The significant coefficients and\ntheoretically consistent directions suggest that the model effectively captures\nkey aspects of coup dynamics. Specifically:\n\n-   The direction and significance of the coefficients align with theoretical\n    expectations. Regimes with less institutional stability, such as military and\n    personalist regimes, are more likely to experience coup attempts.\n\n-   Better economic conditions not only reduce the likelihood of coup attempts\n    but also decrease the likelihood of coup success.\n\n-   Coup attempts are not random events; they occur under specific conditions.\n    Thus, treating the selection process (whether a coup attempt occurs)\n    separately from the outcome (whether the coup is successful) effectively\n    captures this non-randomness.\n\n-   The double probit with samle selection model is designed to correct for\n    selection bias. The similar success rates of coups across different regimes,\n    despite varying attempt rates, indicate potential selection bias. This\n    supports the need for a sample selection model, as coup plotters are likely\n    to attempt coups only when they perceive a high likelihood of success.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of a sample selection model is appropriate for this\nresearch, providing robust insights into the factors influencing coup attempts\nand their outcomes across different regime types. The results highlight the\nsignificant role of regime type in coup dynamics and the selective nature of coup\nattempts, thereby validating the theoretical framework and empirical strategy\nemployed in this study.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe findings of this study underscore the critical role of regime type in\ndetermining the likelihood of coup attempts. Through the application of a double\nprobit with sample selection model, this research highlights that coups are\nsignificantly more probable in military and personalist regimes compared to\ndominant-party regimes. The results suggest that the power dynamics inherent in\ndifferent regime types influence the propensity for coups, with less\ninstitutional stability and more fragmented power structures increasing the risk.\n\nMoreover, the study reveals that better economic conditions, while reducing the\noverall likelihood of coup attempts, paradoxically enhance the chances of coup\nsuccess. This implies that economic resources can provide the necessary support\nfor successful coups, even as they deter initial attempts.\n\nThe significant coefficients and the alignment of results with theoretical\nexpectations validate the use of the sample selection model in this context. By\naccounting for the selection bias in coup attempts, the model offers robust\ninsights into the factors influencing both the occurrence and success of coups.\nThese findings contribute to a deeper understanding of coup dynamics, emphasizing\nthe importance of regime type and economic conditions in shaping political\nstability.\n\nIn conclusion, this study provides a nuanced perspective on coup attempts and\ntheir outcomes, reinforcing the need to consider regime-specific characteristics\nand economic contexts in analyses of political instability. Future research could\nfurther explore the interplay between these factors and examine additional\nvariables that may influence coup dynamics.\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n[^1]: <https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/home.htm>, accessed on\n    2024-05-30\n\n[^2]: In the case of the Ghanaian coup, flight lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings\n    narrowly avoided execution after his initial failure, being freed by mutinous\n    soldiers.
