By distinctly separating autocoups from the broader and more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or executive takeovers, the research introduces a refined and more nuanced definition of autocoups. Building on this clarified conceptual framework, the study unveils a novel dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2023, greatly enhancing the empirical foundation for future research. A robust mixed-methods approach is employed, combining three types of qualitative case studies that offer in-depth insights into the dynamics of autocoups, alongside a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the determinants influencing both autocoup attempts and their outcomes. This rigorous empirical inquiry not only underscores the utility and versatility of the new dataset but also makes a significant contribution to the existing body of literature.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership, Power Transitions]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n  echo: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhile the study of irregular leadership transitions has predominantly focused on\ncoups due to their frequency and significant impact, another form—the incumbent\nleader's refusal to relinquish power—has received comparatively less attention\ndespite its importance. Recent decades, particularly since the end of the Cold\nWar, have witnessed a decline in classic coups and a concomitant rise in this\nincumbent retention or overstay type of irregular leadership transition\n[@ginsburg2010evasion; @baturo2014; @versteeg2020law].\n\nThis research aims to redefine and clarify this type of irregular leadership\ntransition, where leaders overstay their mandated term limits, as an\n***autocoup***. Although analyses related to autocoups are not uncommon, the\nexisting literature exhibits several notable shortcomings:\n\n-   **Terminological ambiguity:** The use of terms like \"self-coups\",\n    \"autocoups\", \"autogolpes\", \"incumbent takeovers\", \"executive aggrandizement\",\n    \"overstay\", and \"continuismo\" in different literature lacks clear,\n    universally accepted definitions, leading to confusion and inconsistent\n    application [@marsteintredet2019; @baturo2022]. This terminological ambiguity\n    hinders accurate analysis and comparison across studies\n\n-   **Limited dataset:** Due to the conceptual ambiguity surrounding autocoups,\n    data collection remains in its nascent stages compared to the rich datasets\n    available for classic coups.\n\n-   **Methodological gaps:** The study of autocoups has been hindered by a\n    limited dataset, resulting in a reliance on in-depth case studies\n    [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022] to explore this phenomenon.\n    Notably, quantitative analysis has been underutilized in this field, with few\n    studies employing statistical methods to examine autocoups.\n\nMore importantly, analyses of autocoups are often not integrated with those of\nclassic coups, despite their interconnected nature. As a distinct category of\ncoup, autocoups lack a clear and differentiated definition in relation to\ntraditional coups. Classic coups are typically defined as the complete removal of\nincumbent leaders, with a focus on the termination of their tenure. In contrast,\nautocoups often focus more on incumbent leaders consolidating power by seizing\ncontrol from other state institutions, rather than on extending their tenure. As\na result, coups and autocoups are frequently analysed in isolation. This\nseparation has led to a dearth of comparative analyses, hindering a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics between these two types of\nirregular leadership transitions.\n\nExamining autocoups, particularly in conjunction with classic coups, is essential\nfor several compelling reasons. Firstly, both coups and autocoups represent\nsignificant and frequent means of irregular leadership transitions, underscoring\nthe need for a comprehensive understanding of these phenomena. Secondly,\nautocoups, much like coups, have a profoundly detrimental impact on governance,\nas they undermine the rule of law, erode institutional capacity, and contribute\nto democratic backsliding or the personalization of authoritarian power. Thirdly,\nsuccessful autocoups, akin to successful coups, create a precedent that increases\nthe likelihood of future irregular power transitions, thereby perpetuating a\ncycle of instability. For instance, since 1945, a striking 62% of leaders who\nextended their terms through autocoups in non-democratic countries ultimately met\na tumultuous end, either being ousted or assassinated while in office\n[@baturo2019]. Lastly, failed autocoups, similar to failed coups, often\nprecipitate instability, inciting widespread protests, violence, and even civil\nwars, which can have far-reaching and devastating consequences for the affected\ncountry and its citizens.\n\nThis chapter addresses these gaps by focusing on autocoups, aiming to clarify\nterminology, refine concepts and definitions, enhance data collection, and\nexplore determinants through empirical analysis, contributing in three key areas:\n\n-   **Conceptual clarification:** The term autocoup will be redefined and\n    clarified, with a focus on power extension.\n\n-   **Data collection:** A new dataset of autocoups since 1945 will be introduced\n    based on this refined definition.\n\n-   **Empirical analysis:** Utilizing this dataset, a quantitative analysis of\n    the factors influencing leaders' decisions to attempt autocoups will be\n    conducted.\n\nThe structure of this chapter is as follows: Section 2 will review definitions\nrelated to power expansions and extensions, leading to a precise definition of\nautocoups. Section 3 will present the new autocoup dataset. Sections 4 and 5 will\nexplore the determinants of autocoup attempts through case studies and\ndemonstrate the application of the dataset in empirical analysis. The conclusion\nwill summarize key findings and suggest directions for future research.\n\n## Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\n\nA significant limitation in the study of irregular leadership transition is the\nconspicuous lack of integration between research on autocoups and classic coups.\nDespite both coups and autocoups being crucial mechanisms of irregular leadership\nchange, the existing literature has largely treated these two phenomena in\nisolation, neglecting to explore their interconnectedness and the nuanced\ndynamics that govern their occurrence.\n\nThis separation is attributable to two primary factors. Firstly, previous\nresearch has often overlooked autocoups as a distinct form of irregular\nleadership transition. Secondly, a persistent conceptual ambiguity has hindered\nthe development of a clear and consistent definition and categorization of\nautocoups.\n\nClassic coups are typically characterized by the abrupt and comprehensive removal\nof incumbent leaders, focusing on the swift termination of their tenure. In\ncontrast, autocoups are often defined as events wherein incumbent leaders\nconsolidate their authority by systematically usurping power from other state\ninstitutions, rather than merely extending their own tenure.\n\nThe absence of a clear, differentiated definition of autocoups in relation to\ntheir classic counterparts has exacerbated this divide. While classic coups have\nbeen extensively studied and well-defined, autocoups remain a distinct yet\nunder-explored category. This definitional ambiguity has resulted in a dearth of\ncomparative analyses that could illuminate the complex interplay between these\ntwo forms of power subversion.\n\nIntegrating the study of autocoups with that of classic coups is crucial for\nbridging this analytical gap. Such an approach would offer a more nuanced and\ncomprehensive perspective on the various mechanisms by which political power can\nbe subverted or consolidated. By examining these phenomena in tandem, researchers\ncan better understand the full spectrum of irregular power transitions, from\noutright removal to internal power grabs, providing valuable insights into the\nnature of political instability and regime change.\n\nTo strengthen the analysis of autocoups, a crucial first step is to establish a\nclear and consistent terminology, followed by a refinement of the definition of\nautocoup to mitigate ambiguity and clarify its distinct characteristics.\n\n### Terminology\n\nThe most prevalent term in autocoup literature is \"self-coup,\" or \"autogolpe\" in\nSpanish [@przeworski2000; @cameron1998a; @bermeo2016; @helmke2017;\n@marsteintredet2019]. This term gained academic prominence following Peruvian\nPresident Alberto Fujimori's actions in 1992, when he dissolved Congress,\ntemporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree [@mauceri1995;\n@cameron1998]. However, as @marsteintredet2019 astutely points out, the term\n\"self-coup\" can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself, which is\ninaccurate since the action typically targets other state institutions or\napparatus.\n\nAnother approach to describing coups staged by incumbents involves using terms\nwith adjectives or modifiers, such as \"presidential coup,\" \"executive coup,\"\n\"constitutional coup,\" \"electoral coup,\" \"judicial coup,\" \"slow-motion coup,\"\n\"soft coup,\" and \"parliamentary coup\" [@marsteintredet2019]. While these terms\ncan be useful in specific instances, their proliferation often creates more\nconfusion than clarity. Most of these terms focus on the specific methods\nemployed by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify the perpetrator,\nnecessitating further explanation. Moreover, many of these methods could be\nemployed either by or against executive leaders, further muddying the waters.\n\nA third alternative involves terms like \"incumbent takeover,\" \"executive\ntakeover,\" or \"overstay.\" Incumbent takeover refers to \"an event perpetuated by a\nruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or informal\nconstraints on his/her power\" [@baturo2022, p.374], building on earlier research\nby [@svolik2014]. Meanwhile, overstay is defined as \"staying longer than the\nmaximum term as it stood when the candidate originally came into office\"\n[@ginsburg2011evasion, p.1844]. These terms effectively identify the perpetrator\n(the incumbent) and/or the nature of the event (overstaying/extending power).\nHowever, they fall short in highlighting the illegality or illegitimacy of these\nactions. Consequently, they cannot serve as a direct counterpart to \"coup,\" which\nclearly denotes the illegality of leadership ousters, while \"takeover\" or\n\"overstay\" diminish the severity of the act.\n\nGiven that these terms often lack precision, focusing on specific methods rather\nthan the core act of power usurpation, this study proposes \"autocoup\" as the most\nsuitable term for this phenomenon. Unlike other terms, 'autocoup' clearly\nidentifies the perpetrator and the illegitimate nature of the power grab,\ndistinguishing it from classic coups while maintaining a parallel structure in\nterminology.\n\n### Definition\n\nWhile precise terminology is undoubtedly crucial, another issue arises with\nprevious definitions of autocoups: what is the primary emphasis—power expansion,\npower extension, or a combination of the two?\n\nDefinitions of power expansion and power extension within the field of political\nscience can often be ambiguous or overlapping, presenting a potential source of\nconfusion. To ensure greater clarity in the study of autocoups, it is necessary\nto distinguish these two distinct conceptual frameworks more clearly:\n\n-   **Power expansion:** This refers to the process by which an incumbent leader\n    acquires additional authority or control over state apparatuses beyond their\n    original mandate. This may involve centralizing power, reducing checks and\n    balances, or encroaching on the authority of other branches such as the\n    legislature or judiciary.\n\n-   **Power extension:** This describes situations where a leader prolongs their\n    tenure beyond the originally mandated term in office, often through\n    constitutional amendments, cancellation of elections, or other means of\n    circumventing term limits.\n\nExisting definitions of autocoups or related concepts often suffer from ambiguity\nbetween power expansion and extension, or they focus more on power expansion,\nwhich has several drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align\nwell with the traditional definition of a coup. A classical coup is clearly\nfocused on the ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or\nrestriction on their power. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition\nof an autocoup should prioritize the tenure extension of executive leadership.\nPower restrictions on incumbents would not be coded as a coup as long as they\nremain in office. Similarly, an executive leader acquiring more power from other\nbranches could be coded as power aggrandizement but not an autocoup, as long as\nthey step down when their term expires.\n\nSecondly, emphasizing power expansion in autocoups often neglects the ultimate\npurpose of incumbents. It is irrational for an incumbent to expand executive\npower only to pass the powerful role to future leaders. Although the term\n\"self-coup\" gained prominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which\ninitially involved seizing power from other institutions, it is important to note\nthat Fujimori ultimately extended his term limits through constitutional\namendments. The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term,\nwhich he won in April 1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his\nsupporters in Congress passed a law of \"authentic interpretation\" that\neffectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000, which he won amid\nsuspicions and rumors. However, he did not survive the third term; in 2000,\nfacing charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took\nrefuge in Japan [@ezrow2019].\n\nThirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be\nchallenging. As @cameron1998a defined, a self-coup is \"a temporary suspension of\nthe constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who rules by\ndecree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to ratify a\npolitical system with broader executive power\" (p. 220). However, defining\n\"broader executive power\" is inherently problematic and disputable.\n\nTherefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should\nprioritize power extension as its core characteristic. This approach is\nstraightforward and easy to identify in practice. In most cases, autocoups\ninvolving power extension also involve power expansions as their prerequisite and\nforeshadowing.\n\nBased on these criteria, I define **an autocoup as the illegitimate extension of\nan incumbent leader's term in office beyond the originally mandated limits\nthrough unconstitutional means**. This definition emphasizes the core\ncharacteristic of power extension while acknowledging the potential for power\nexpansion as a related phenomenon:\n\n-   **Leadership Focus**: This definition refers to the actual leaders of the\n    country, regardless of their official titles. Typically, this would be the\n    president; however, in some cases, such as in Germany, the primary leader is\n    the premier, as the president serves as a nominal head of state.\n\n-   **Primary Characteristic**: While the primary characteristic of an autocoup\n    is extending the term in office, this definition does not exclude instances\n    of power expansion. Both aspects can coexist, but the extension of the term\n    is the central element.\n\n-   **Illegitimacy**: Autocoups, by their nature, subvert legal norms and\n    established leadership transfer mechanisms. No matter how legitimate they\n    claim to be, their illegitimacy is not beyond a reasonable doubt as long as\n    the incumbents are the direct beneficiaries. This critical aspect will be\n    explored further in Section 3.\n\nBy clarifying these definitions, this study aims to provide a more precise and\nconsistent framework for understanding and analysing autocoups, thereby enhancing\nthe clarity and rigor of research in this field.\n\n## Introduction to the autocoup dataset\n\n### Defining the scope\n\nClassifying political events as autocoups often involves addressing borderline\ncases. To maintain consistency and avoid ambiguity, this study adopts a broad\ncoding approach: All instances of incumbents extending their original mandated\nterm in office are coded as autocoups, regardless of the apparent legality of the\nextension.\n\nThis approach is justified because truly legitimate amendments to power\ntransition institutions should apply only to subsequent leaders, not the\nincumbent. Even when extension procedures appear legal, the legitimacy is\nquestionable when the incumbent is the direct beneficiary.\n\n### Classifying autocoups {#sec-classify}\n\nTo maintain consistency, autocoups are categorized based on several key factors.\n\n-   **Methods employed**: Specific strategies used by incumbents (e.g.,\n    constitutional amendments, election cancellation).\n\n-   **Degree of legality**: Extent of deviation from established legal norms.\n\n-   **Duration of extension**: Length of time the incumbent remains in office\n    beyond designated term limits.\n\n-   **Outcomes**: Whether the autocoup attempt succeeds or fails.\n\nThis study primarily focuses on the methods employed, while coding for other\naspects when information is available.\n\n#### Evasion of term limits\n\nEvasion of term limits is a common tactic employed in autocoups. Incumbents often\nresort to seemingly legal manoeuvres to extend their hold on power. These\nmanoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means. The incumbents may pressure legislative bodies (congress) or\njudicial institutions (Supreme Court) to reinterpret existing term limits, amend\nthe constitution to extend terms, or even replace the constitution altogether.\nThis might also involve popular vote through referendums, or a combination of\nthese approaches. The extension can range from a single term to indefinite rule.\n\nThese manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through\nvarious means.\n\n-   **Changing term length:** Incumbents might lengthen the official term\n    duration (e.g., from 4 to 6 years) to stay in office longer, even if the\n    number of allowed terms remains unchanged. Examples, in the dataset, include\n    Presidents Dacko (CAR, 1962), Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and Pinochet (Chile,\n    1988).\n\n-   **Enabling re-election:** This approach involves incumbents modifying legal\n    or constitutional frameworks to permit themselves to run for leadership\n    again, despite initial restrictions. These restrictions might include\n    prohibitions on re-election, bans on immediate re-election, or term limits\n    that the incumbents have already reached. An illustrative example is\n    President Menem of Argentina in 1993, who leveraged this tactic to extend his\n    tenure.\n\n-   **Removing term limits altogether:** This approach was implemented by\n    President Paul Biya of Cameroon in 2008. Biya, who had been in power since\n    1982, successfully pushed for a constitutional amendment that abolished\n    presidential term limits. This change allowed him to run for re-election\n    indefinitely, effectively opening the possibility for him to rule for life.\n\n-   **Declaring** **leader for life:** This differs from removing term limits as\n    the leader still faces elections (although potentially rigged or\n    uncontested). An example is Indonesia's President Sukarno, who attempted to\n    declare himself president for life in 1963 (ultimately unsuccessful).\n\nThese methods are often used in combination. Initially, the duration of a term is\nextended, followed by amendments to allow re-election, then the removal of term\nlimits, and finally, the declaration of the leader for life. For example, Haitian\nPresident François Duvalier amended the constitution in 1961 to permit immediate\nre-election and then declared himself president for life in 1964.\n\n#### Election manipulation or rigging\n\nElection manipulation or rigging is the second most commonly used tactic to\nextend an incumbent's tenure.\n\n-   **Delaying or removing elections:** Delaying or removing scheduled elections\n    without legitimate justification is a frequent method used by incumbents to\n    maintain power. For instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye delayed\n    general elections until 1969 after assuming power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan\n    President José Eduardo dos Santos suspended elections throughout his rule\n    from 1979 to 2017.\n\n-   **Refusing unfavourable election results:** Incumbents may refuse to accept\n    unfavourable election results and attempt to overturn them through\n    illegitimate means. For example, President Donald Trump of the United States\n    refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and tried to overturn\n    them.\n\n-   **Rigging elections:** Winning elections with an extraordinarily high\n    percentage of votes is highly questionable. This study will code elections\n    where the incumbent wins more than 90% of the vote as autocoups. For\n    instance, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently won\n    elections with over 95% of the vote in multi-party elections since 1996,\n    indicating election rigging.\n\n-   **Excluding opposition in elections:** Manipulating the electoral process by\n    excluding opposition parties or candidates from participation, effectively\n    creating a one-candidate race, clearly signifies an autocoup.\n\n#### Figurehead Installation\n\nOne strategy employed by incumbents to evade term limits is to install a trusted\nassociate as a figurehead, allowing the incumbent to maintain de facto control\nwhile formally relinquishing office. This can be achieved through the creation of\nseemingly subordinate positions, which in reality serve as conduits for the\nincumbent's continued influence.\n\nA notable example of this tactic is the 2008 Russian presidential transition.\nConfronted with constitutional term limits, President Vladimir Putin hand-picked\nDmitry Medvedev to succeed him as president. Following Medvedev's election, he\nappointed Putin as Prime Minister, ostensibly reversing their roles. However,\nmost observers and analysts concur that Putin continued to wield significant\nbehind-the-scenes influence, effectively rendering Medvedev a proxy leader.\n\n#### Reassigning supreme authority to a new role\n\nThis tactic involves an incumbent leader manipulating the constitution or legal\nframework to create a new position of power, or elevate an existing one, before\nstepping down from their current role. They then strategically take on this new\nposition, effectively retaining significant control despite appearing to\nrelinquish power. For example, in 2017, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Prime Minister\nof Turkey, spearheaded a constitutional referendum that transitioned the country\nfrom a parliamentary system to a presidential one. This new system concentrated\nsignificant executive power in the presidency. Following the referendum's\napproval, Erdoğan successfully ran for the newly established presidency,\neffectively retaining control under a different title.\n\n#### One-time arrangement for current leaders\n\nThis strategy involves special arrangements that extend the term or tenure of\ncurrent leaders without altering the underlying institutions. For example,\nLebanon extended President Émile Lahoud's term by three years in 2004 through a\none-time arrangement.\n\n### Data coding\n\nThe autocoup dataset is built upon existing studies and datasets, ensuring a\ncomprehensive and reliable foundation. @tbl-source outlines the main sources used\nfor coding the autocoup dataset.\n\nThe Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political Leaders' Affiliation\nDatabase (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded] provide comprehensive data on all leaders\nfrom 1875 to 2023, although our coding only includes autocoups since 1945. These\ndatasets are invaluable for identifying actual rulers, distinguishing them from\nnominal heads of state.\n\nThe Incumbent Takeover dataset [@baturo2022] integrates data from 11 related\ndatasets, offering a broad spectrum of cases where leaders significantly reduced\nconstraints on their power. This dataset includes both power expansions and\nextensions, necessitating cross-referencing with Archigos to verify\nqualifications for autocoups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-source .cell tbl-cap='Main Data Sources for Coding the Autocoup Dataset'}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"zbrvrsoime\" style=\"padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;overflow-x:auto;overflow-y:auto;width:auto;height:auto;\">\n  \n  <table class=\"gt_table\" data-quarto-disable-processing=\"false\" data-quarto-bootstrap=\"false\" style=\"-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;

The remaining\n15 events were newly\ncoded by the author through verification with other sources such as Archigos,\nPLAD and news reports.\n\nThe main deviation from the Incumbent Takeover dataset arises from excluding\npower expansions that do not involve attempts to extend tenure.\n\nThe dataset encompasses a total of 14 variables along with the *notes* field.\n\n-   **Country identification:** Country code (*ccode*) and country name\n    (*country*) from Correlates of War project [@stinnett2002].\n\n-   **Leader information:** Name of the de facto leader (*leader_name*,coded\n    following Archigos and PLAD datasets).\n\n-   **Timeline variables:** Date the leader assumed power (*entry_date*), date\n    the leader left office(*exit_date*), date of the significant event marking\n    the autocoup (*autocoup_date*), and Start date of the leader's additional\n    term acquired through the autocoup (*extending_date*).\n\n-   **Power transition methods:** Categorical variable for how the leader entered\n    power (*entry_method*), categorical variable for how the leader exited power\n    (*exit_method*), dummy variable indicating regular (1) or irregular (0) entry\n    (*entry_regular*), and dummy variable indicating regular (1) or irregular (0)\n    exit (*exit_regular*).\n\n-   **Autocoup details:** Key variable capturing methods used to extend power\n    (*autocoup_method*) and outcome of the autocoup attempt (*autocoup_outcome*,\n    \"fail and lose power\", \"fail but complete original tenure\", or \"successful\").\n    For successful coups, the additional term length can be calculated from the\n    difference between *exit_date* and *extending_date*.\n\n-   **Data source:** Identifies the dataset source used for coding (*source*).\n\n-   **Additional notes:** Provides context for exceptional cases (*notes*).\n\nThere are a few coding challenges and decisions worth mention. For cases where\nextensions happen incrementally, the *autocoup_date* reflects a significant event\nmarking the extension, such as a legislative vote or successful referendum. In\ncases where a leader undertook multiple autocoup attempts, details are recorded\nin the notes field. Care was taken to differentiate between cases of power\nexpansion and actual attempts to extend tenure, which required cross-referencing\nmultiple sources. Determining the success or failure of an autocoup attempt often\nrequired in-depth research, especially for less documented cases.\n\n### Data descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary coding has identified 110 autocoup cases from 1945 to\n2023, involving 73 countries. This comprehensive dataset provides\na rich source of information for analysing trends and patterns in autocoup\nattempts across different political contexts.\n\n@tbl-autocoup_method presents a breakdown of the autocoup methods employed by\nleaders:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-autocoup_method .cell tbl-cap='Autocoup methods and success rates (1945-2021)'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{0.99\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lccr}\n\\toprule\nAutocoup Method & Attempted & Succeeded & Success Rate \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nEnabling re-election & 46 & 33 & 71.7\\% \\\\ \nRemoving term limits & 14 & 14 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nDelaying elections & 9 & 9 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nLeader for life & 9 & 9 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nChanging term length & 7 & 5 & 71.4\\% \\\\ \nFigurehead & 6 & 5 & 83.3\\% \\\\ \nOne-time arrangement & 5 & 4 & 80.0\\% \\\\ \nRefusing election results & 4 & 1 & 25.0\\% \\\\ \nReassigning power role & 4 & 2 & 50.0\\% \\\\ \nRigging elections & 3 & 2 & 66.7\\% \\\\ \nCancelling elections & 3 & 3 & 100.0\\% \\\\ \nTotal & 110 & 87 & 79.1\\% \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{Source: Autocoup dataset}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\end{table}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common autocoup method is \"enabling re-election\", accounting for\n46 events. This is followed by \"removing term limits\"\n(14 cases), and then \"delaying elections\" and\n\"declaring the leader for life\" (each with 9 cases).\n\nAutocoups have a success rate of 79%, compared to the 50% success rate of\nclassical coups. This high success rate can be attributed to several factors:\n\n-   Incumbent Advantage: Leaders already in power have access to resources and\n    institutional mechanisms that can be leveraged to their advantage.\n\n-   Gradual Implementation: Unlike sudden coups, autocoups can be implemented\n    gradually, allowing leaders to build support and legitimacy over time.\n\n-   Legal Facade: Many autocoup methods operate within a veneer of legality,\n    making them harder to oppose openly.\n\n-   Control of State Apparatus: Incumbents often have significant control over\n    state institutions, which can be used to facilitate their autocoup attempts.\n\nHowever, success rates vary significantly across different methods.\n\n-   **100% success rate**: Removing term limits, delaying elections, declaring\n    the leader for life, and cancelling elections all have perfect success rates.\n    This suggests that once these processes are set in motion, they are difficult\n    to reverse.\n\n-   **Lower success rates:** Refusing to accept election results has the lowest\n    success rate, with only 1 out of 4 attempts succeeding. Although the sample\n    size is limited (only 4 cases in total), this trend might suggest several\n    factors at play. These include greater democratic resilience in systems where\n    general elections are regularly held, heightened international scrutiny and\n    pressure in response to blatant manipulation of election results, and\n    stronger domestic opposition to such overt power grabs.\n\n## Determinants of autocoup attempts: Case studies\n\n### High frequency and success rate of autocoups in post-communist regimes\n\nOur dataset shows a high frequency and success rate of autocoups in\npost-communist countries. These nations, formerly communist regimes prior to the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, have largely evolved into 'hybrid regimes'\n[@nurumov2019], with only a few retaining their communist status. The data\ndocuments 12 cases of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency in these\ncountries, with only two attempts failing. Examination of these cases highlights\nseveral distinctive characteristics:\n\n-   **Inherited authoritarian systems**: Despite most of these 12 countries\n    transitioning from communist to non-communist governments (with the exception\n    of China), they retained many authoritarian systems from their communist\n    past.\n\n-   **Continuity of former elites**: The transitions did not result in the\n    removal or overthrow of previous ruling groups. Instead, former communist\n    elites often maintained their positions of power.\n\n-   **Subverted democratic processes**: While general elections and term limits\n    were introduced in most of these countries, the legacy of former communist\n    regimes frequently led to the circumvention of term limits and manipulation\n    of elections [@nurumov2019].\n\n#### Case 1: Lifelong ruler–Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus\n\nAlexander Lukashenko, a former member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian\nSoviet Socialist Republic, became the head of the interim anti-corruption\ncommittee of the Supreme Council of Belarus following the dissolution of the\nSoviet Union. Elected as Belarus's first president in 1994, he has maintained\nthis position ever since. Initially, the 1994 constitution limited presidents to\ntwo successive terms. However, Lukashenko removed this restriction in 2004.\nInternational monitors have not regarded Belarusian elections as free and fair\nsince his initial victory. Despite significant protests, Lukashenko has\nconsistently claimed to win with a high vote share, often exceeding 80% in each\nelection. This pattern is evident across all five Central Asian countries of the\nformer Soviet Union, where post-dissolution leaders were typically high officials\nor heads of the former Soviet republics who continued their leadership in the\npresidency.\n\n#### Case 2: Transferring power to a handpicked successor–Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan\n\nNursultan Nazarbayev served as the first president of Kazakhstan from 1991 until\n2019. Prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he held de facto leadership\nas the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. Following\nindependence, he was elected as the first president and retained office until\n2019 through various means, including resetting term limits due to the\nimplementation of new constitutions. Notably, Nazarbayev did not officially\neliminate term limits but instead created an exemption for the \"First President\"\n[@nurumov2019]. Unlike Lukashenko, who remains the incumbent of Belarus,\nNazarbayev transferred the presidency to a designated successor, Kassym-Jomart\nTokayev, in 2019. However, he retained significant influence as the Chairman of\nthe Security Council of Kazakhstan until 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin America\n\nLatin America has a long-standing tradition of maintaining term limit\nconventions. Simón Bolívar, the founding father of Bolivia, was initially a\nstrong advocate for term limits, stating in 1819, \"Nothing is as dangerous as\nallowing the same citizen to remain in power for a long time... That's the origin\nof usurpation and tyranny\" [@ginsburg2019, p.38]. Although Bolívar eventually\nmodified his stance, arguing in his 1826 Constitution Assembly speech that \"a\npresident for life with the right to choose the successor is the most sublime\ninspiration for the republican order,\" term limits became a convention in Latin\nAmerica. Approximately 81% of Latin American constitutions between independence\nand 1985 imposed some form of term limits on the presidency\n[@marsteintredet2019a].\n\nAn analysis of cases in Latin American countries reveals two notable patterns.\n\n#### Often successful at breaking non-re-election or non-immediate re-election restrictions\n\nUnlike other presidential systems where two terms are more common,\nnon-re-election or non-immediate re-election used to be prevalent in Latin\nAmerica. According to @marsteintredet2019a, non-consecutive re-election was\nmandated in about 64.9% of all constitutions between independence and 1985, while\n5.9% banned re-election entirely.\n\nHowever, adherence to these conventions has varied across the region. Since\nMexico introduced non-re-election institutions in 1911 at the start of the\nMexican Revolution, they have remained inviolate [@klesner2019]. Similarly,\nPanama and Uruguay have never altered their re-election rules, and Costa Rica has\nonly experienced a brief period (1897-1913) permitting immediate presidential\nre-election since prohibiting it in 1859 [@marsteintredet2019a]. In many other\ncountries, however, constitutions have been frequently amended or violated.\n\nThe pursuit of re-election or consecutive re-election, therefore, has been a\nsignificant trigger for autocoups aimed at power extension in this region. Our\nresearch documents 32 autocoup cases, with over 50% (17 cases) attempting to\nenable re-election or immediate re-election, and about 59% (10 cases out of 17)\nbeing successful.\n\nUnlike those who attempt to overstay in office indefinitely, many Latin American\nleaders exit after their second term expires. Examples include President Fernando\nHenrique Cardoso of Brazil (1995-2003), President Danilo Medina of the Dominican\nRepublic (2012-2020), and President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras\n(2014-2022) [@ginsburg2019; @marsteintredet2019a; @landau2019; @baturo2019;\n@neto2019].\n\n#### Failing to further extend tenure\n\nThis trend does not imply that none of these leaders attempted further\nextensions, but rather that most accepted their unsuccessful outcomes without\nabusing their power to manipulate the process. While autocoups aimed at securing\none additional term are often successful, attempts to overstay beyond this are\nfrequently unsuccessful.\n\nIn contrast to the previous examples, two contrasting cases illustrate the varied\noutcomes of term limit challenges:\n\n-   **Unsuccessful extension – Carlos Menem (Argentina)**: President Menem\n    successfully extended his tenure by one term through a 1994 constitutional\n    amendment allowing one executive re-election. He was subsequently re-elected\n    in 1995. However, his attempt to reset his term count, arguing that his first\n    term (1988-1995) should not count as it was under previous constitutions, was\n    unanimously rejected by the Supreme Court in March 1999 [@llanos2019]. A\n    similar scenario unfolded with President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia (2002-2010)\n    [@baturo2019].\n\n-   **Successful extension – Daniel Ortega (Nicaragua)**: In contrast, Daniel\n    Ortega, the incumbent president of Nicaragua, successfully extended his\n    presidency. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua permitted his\n    re-election in 2011. Subsequently, in 2014, the National Assembly of\n    Nicaragua approved constitutional amendments abolishing presidential term\n    limits, allowing Ortega to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. As\n    a result, he has held the presidency since 2007 [@close2019].\n\n### As common as classical coups: Cases of African countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassical coups have been prevalent in Africa, accounting for approximately 45%\nof all global coups (219 out of 491 cases) since 1950, involving 45 out of 54\nAfrican countries (GIC dataset). While autocoups are less frequent compared to\ntraditional coups, they maintain a significant presence in Africa. Among 110\ndocumented autocoup cases globally, 46% (51 cases) occurred in Africa, involving\n36 countries. Notably, the success rate of autocoups in Africa is over 84% (43\nout of 51 attempts), which surpasses both the success rate of classical coups in\nthe region (roughly 50%) and the global average success rate of autocoups (79%).\n\nIdentifying a clear pattern of autocoups in Africa is challenging, mirroring the\ncomplexity observed with classical coups. Various factors have been proposed to\nexplain this phenomenon:\n\n-   **Natural Resources**: Countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil\n    or diamonds, may see leaders more likely to attempt and succeed in extending\n    their terms [@posner; @cheeseman2015; @cheeseman2019a].\n\n-   **Quality of democracy**: The quality of democracy is a critical factor\n    influencing respect for term limits [@reyntjens2016].\n\n-   **International influence**: International aid or donor influence can play a\n    significant role in discouraging attempts at power extension [@brown2001;\n    @tangri2010].\n\n-   **Organized opposition and party unity**: The extent of organized opposition\n    and the president's ability to enforce unity within the ruling party are\n    crucial factors [@cheeseman2019].\n\nUtilizing the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, @cassani2020\nhighlights human rights abuses and the desire for impunity as main drivers for\nincumbents to cling to power. The more authoritarian a leader, the more likely\nthey are to attempt to break term limits and overstay in office. A leader's\nability to secure the loyalty of the armed forces through public investment\nincreases the chances of success in overstaying.\n\nDespite both coups and autocoups being prevalent, there has been a noticeable\nshift since the end of the Cold War in 1991: Traditional coups have decreased in\nfrequency while autocoups have become more prevalent.\n\nThis trend can be partially attributed to the introduction of multi-party\nelections in Africa in the 1990s, which also brought in term limits for\nexecutives [@cassani2020; @cheeseman2019]. Before 1991, personal or military rule\nwas more common, and term limits were less frequent. Post-1991, with more term\nlimits introduced, challenges to these limits have increased. However, it is\ncrucial to note that this increase in challenges does not necessarily imply that\nviolations are more common than adherence to term limits, because total power\ntransitions have increased compared to the past.\n\n## Empirical analysis: An example of utilizing the autocoup dataset\n\nThe autocoup dataset opens up opportunities for quantitative analysis that extend\nbeyond traditional case studies. This section presents a clear example of how to\neffectively leverage this dataset. To examine the factors driving autocoup\nattempts, I employ a probit regression model, demonstrating its applicability for\ninvestigating the determinants of such events. This example highlights the\ndataset's potential for robust empirical inquiry and provides a foundation for\nfuture research on the conditions that influence autocoup attempts.\n\n### Dependent variables[^1]\n\n-   **Autocoup attempt**: Binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt\n    occurred (1) or not (0) during the tenure of an incumbent leader.\n\n-   **Autocoup success**: Binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt\n    was successful (1) or failed (0), conditional on an autocoup attempt\n    occurring.\n\n### Key independent variable: regime type\n\nI categorize regime types following @geddes2014 (GWF), focusing on military,\npersonalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included\nfor comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in\n@tbl-regimes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-regimes .cell tbl-cap='Regime types since 1950'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"fkzjfaqcfy\" style=\"padding-left:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;overflow-x:auto;overflow-y:auto;width:auto;height:auto;\">\n  \n  <table class=\"gt_table\" data-quarto-disable-processing=\"false\" data-quarto-bootstrap=\"false\" style=\"-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;

They\nanalysed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic\ngrowth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are\nparticularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance,\npolitical violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control\nvariables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   **Economic Level:** Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an\nindication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a\ncountry. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international 1000\ndollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by @fariss2022.\n-   **Economic Performance:** Measured using the current-trend ($CT$) ratio\ndeveloped by @krishnarajan2019. This ratio compares a country's current GDP\nper capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A\nhigher $CT$ ratio indicates stronger economic performance. For a country $i$\nat year $t$, the $CT$ ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n    \\end{aligned}\n$$ {#eq-eq6}\n\n-   **Political stability:** This variable captures overall regime stability by\n    including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and\n    interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the\n    variable “actotal” in the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset\n    [@marshall2005current], with 0 representing the most stable conditions (no\n    violence at all) and 18 representing the most unstable.\n\n-   **Previous coups:** Included in the selection equation as either: a) The\n    number of previous coups in a country (Model 1), or b) The time since the\n    last coup attempt (Model 2 for robustness check).\n\n-   **Population size:** To account for its potential impact on leaders' tenures,\n    we consider the log of the population size. This transformation helps in\n    managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The\n    data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its\n    influence on power transitions. Larger populations may present more\n    governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting\n    the stability and longevity of a leader's tenure.\n\n-   **Leader's age:** The age of the leader is included as an additional variable\n    in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with\n    leadership strength. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks,\n    and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain\n    power. This data is sourced from Archigos and PLAD datasets.\n\nUnlike the analysis of classic coup determinants, which could theoretically occur\nin any given year, I assume that an autocoup happens only once during an\nincumbent leader's tenure, as a successful autocoup negates the need for another\nattempt. However, this assumption does not always reflect reality, as leaders\nmight attempt further extensions or try again after a failed attempt. For\nsimplicity, I overlook these possibilities in our analysis.\n\nTherefore, in our probit model, the unit of analysis for autocoups is the entire\ntenure of a leader, rather than a country-year. I establish a base year for the\nvariables: for leaders who staged an autocoup, we use the year of their first\nattempt as the base year; for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, I use the\nmiddle year of their tenure as the base year.\n\n### Results and discussions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-autocoupmodel .cell tbl-cap='Determinants of autocoup attempts and success (1945-2018)'}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{@{\\extracolsep{50pt}}lcc} \n\\\\[-1.8ex]\\hline \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n & Autocoup Attempts & Autocoup Outcome \\\\ \n\\\\[-1.8ex] & (1) & (2)\\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \n Constant & $-$1.674$^{***}$ & $-$0.888 \\\\ \n  & (0.624) & (1.935) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Regime: Dominant-party & 0.070 & 0.672$^{*}$ \\\\ \n  & (0.145) & (0.402) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Military & $-$0.255 & 0.615 \\\\ \n  & (0.189) & (0.541) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n \\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist & 0.737$^{***}$ & 1.609$^{***}$ \\\\ \n  & (0.157) & (0.448) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n GDP per capita & $-$0.009 & 0.064 \\\\ \n  & (0.011) & (0.045) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Economic trend & 0.653 & 0.197 \\\\ \n  & (0.533) & (1.772) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Political stability & $-$0.044 & 0.126 \\\\ \n  & (0.036) & (0.130) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Age & $-$0.001 & 0.004 \\\\ \n  & (0.001) & (0.017) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n Population(log) & $-$0.048 & 0.029 \\\\ \n  & (0.042) & (0.144) \\\\ \n  & & \\\\ \n\\hline \\\\[-1.8ex] \nObservations & 1,028 & 102 \\\\ \nLog Likelihood & $-$308.494 & $-$43.651 \\\\ \nAkaike Inf.

Among the regime types, personalist regimes\nsignificantly increase the likelihood of autocoup attempts, all else being equal.\nThis suggests that leaders in personalist regimes are more prone to attempt to\nextend their power through autocoups compared to leaders in democratic regimes\n(reference regime). Leaders in dominant-party and military regimes, however, show\nno significant difference in the likelihood of attempting an autocoup compared to\ndemocratic leaders.\n\nThe model for autocoup success (Model 2) shows similar dynamics. Personalist\nregimes again have a strong positive and significant effect on the success of\nautocoups compared to democratic leaders. Dominant-party regimes also show a\npositive and marginally significant effect. However, a detailed examination\nreveals that about half of the successful autocoups in dominant-party regimes (9\nout of 20) exhibit a personalist style, such as \"party-personal-military\"\nregimes.\n\nThis outcome is logical since personalist leaders are typically much more\npowerful than other types of leaders, making them more inclined and capable of\noverstaying in power.\n\nOther factors play an insignificant role in determining the attempts and outcomes\nof autocoups. This aligns with our conclusions on the determinants of classic\ncoups. Both coups and autocoups are significantly affected by power dynamics. As\npower transitions involve the struggle between seizing and maintaining power, the\nbalance of power status quo inevitably matters in both coups and autocoups. This\nalso explains the high success rate of autocoups. Compared to power challengers,\nincumbents are in an obviously advantageous position. Incumbent leaders can use\nstate power to their benefit, which is difficult to counteract. Even the abuse of\npower is often unchecked under a powerful leader's rule.\n\nThe empirical analysis of autocoups yields significant implications for\nreal-world politics. In particular, the high overall success rate of autocoups\nhighlights the vulnerability of democratic institutions to gradual erosion by\nincumbent leaders. The threshold for ousting or impeaching an incumbent leader\nthrough constitutional means is exceptionally high, with success often requiring\nmore than a simple majority and substantial support across various sectors.\nResorting to illegal means, such as a coup, presents even greater challenges due\nto high costs, severe consequences, and a low likelihood of success.\n\nConversely, political dynamics, whether in democracies or autocracies, tend to\nfavour incumbents even when they act unconstitutionally. Incumbents can leverage\nstate resources to achieve their political ambitions, benefiting from a high\nprobability of success and minimal consequences in case of failure. This\nasymmetry in power and risk creates a concerning scenario: for incumbents who do\nnot respect constitutional institutions, the opportunity to launch an autocoup\nappears sufficiently low-risk to warrant an attempt.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study conducts a thorough and comprehensive analysis of autocoups, with a\nspecific focus on political events where incumbent leaders illegitimately extend\ntheir tenure in power. By refining the existing definition and distinguishing\nautocoups from related concepts such as \"self-coups\", \"autogolpes\", and\n\"executive takeovers\", this research introduces a novel dataset that catalogues\nautocoups from 1945 to 2023. This refined definition and the accompanying dataset\nenable the study to broaden its analysis of irregular leadership transitions.\nWhile traditional analyses often concentrate on the abrupt termination of tenure\nthrough coups, this research expands the scope to include the irregular extension\nof tenure through autocoups. This approach provides a more comprehensive and\nnuanced understanding of the phenomenon, highlighting the various mechanisms by\nwhich incumbent leaders can subvert democratic processes to maintain their power.\n\nThe findings reveal that personalist regimes are significantly more likely to\nexperience autocoup attempts and succeed in these attempts compared to\ndemocracies. Dominant-party systems, often exhibiting personalist\ncharacteristics, also show an association with successful autocoups. While regime\ntype significantly influences autocoups, other factors appear less impactful,\nmirroring classic coups where the balance of power is a more essential\ndeterminant. The high success rate of autocoups can be attributed to the inherent\nadvantages incumbents possess, such as control over or abuse of state power and\nthe difficulty of removing or impeaching them through legal or illegal means.\n\nHowever, several limitations warrant consideration for future research. Firstly,\nthe definition of an autocoup requires further commentary and discussion to gain\nwider acceptance in the academic community. Despite efforts to maintain\nobjectivity, some coding decisions may involve subjective judgments, particularly\nin borderline cases. Secondly, due to the nature of autocoups, which are less\nfrequent than classic coups (491 coups versus 110 autocoups during the same\nperiod), the quantitative analysis cannot be conducted as a country-year variable\nas in coup studies. This raises the issue of choosing an appropriate base year\nfor the analysis, which requires further discussion and potentially sensitivity\nanalyses.\n\nDespite these limitations, this research significantly enhances our understanding\nof the mechanisms and motivations behind autocoups, contributing to the\nliterature on political stability and democratic resilience. The findings\nhighlight the vulnerability of political systems, particularly democracies, to\nerosion from within by incumbent leaders.\n\nFuture studies could build on this work by employing the dataset to explore more\nnuanced power dynamics or examine the long-term impacts of these events on\npolitical systems. Particularly fruitful areas for investigation include the\nrelationship between autocoups and democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown,\nand the personalization of power. Additionally, comparative analyses between\nautocoups and traditional coups could yield insights into the evolving nature of\npower consolidation strategies in different political contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, this study enhances our understanding of autocoups by clarifying\nterminology, refining definitions, and providing a comprehensive dataset. Future\nresearch could explore the relationship between autocoups and democratic\nbacksliding, democratic breakdown, and the personalization of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: The dataset used in this article is publicly available and can be accessed\n    at: <https://github.com/reddylee/Datasets>.\n",
