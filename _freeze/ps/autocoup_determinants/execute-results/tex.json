Addressing a notable gap in the existing literature, the study contends that the balance of power plays a critical role in shaping the likelihood of autocoup events. In contrast to classical coups—which are often triggered by unstable or fragmented power structures—autocoups tend to arise in contexts characterised by stable and concentrated power.\n  To operationalise the concept of power balance in an observable manner, regime type is employed as a proxy, reflecting the structural distribution of power between incumbents and potential institutional constraints or elite challengers.\n  Using a bias-reduced logistic regression model, the analysis finds that regime type is a significant predictor of autocoup attempts. Leaders operating within regimes marked by concentrated power are more prone to extend their tenure unconstitutionally. In particular, presidential democracies and personalist autocracies are found to be significantly more susceptible to autocoup attempts than dominant-party regimes.\n  The study contributes to the broader literature on irregular leadership transitions by offering a more systematic and empirically grounded account of the conditions under which incumbents seek to subvert constitutional term limits.\n  \nkeywords: [Autocoups, Coup, Regime types, Tenure Extension, Authoritarianism]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n  echo: false\n---\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhy are some political leaders removed from office prematurely, while others\nsucceed in extending their tenure beyond constitutionally mandated limits? The\nextant literature has extensively examined the former issue—namely, the forced\nremoval of leaders prior to the completion of their terms. Most such instances\nare attributed to classical coups, defined as illegal and overt attempts by\nmilitary or state elites to depose a sitting executive [@powell2011], due to\ntheir frequency and immediate impact on incumbent displacement. For example, in\nautocratic regimes, classical coups account for nearly one-third of all\nleadership exits, surpassing regular transitions, which comprise just over\none-fifth [@frantz2016]. Moreover, over $63\\%$ of non-constitutional removals in\ndictatorships are attributable to coups [@svolik2009].\n\nBy contrast, the latter part of the question—why some leaders are able to extend\ntheir tenure beyond constitutional limits—remains comparatively underexplored.\nThis oversight stems primarily from conceptual ambiguity and the lack of\nsystematic data on such political events, specifically autocoups, which has\nimpeded rigorous empirical investigation. Nonetheless, the importance of studying\nautocoups should not be underestimated. Firstly, autocoups represent one of the\nmost prevalent forms of irregular leadership transition, with over 80 documented\ncases since 1945. Their frequency has notably increased since 2000, coinciding\nwith a marked global decline in classical coups [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019].\nSecondly, autocoups exert profound consequences on political stability and\ndemocratic development, frequently leading to long-term institutional erosion.\nThirdly, identifying the drivers of autocoup attempts is essential for\nunderstanding their broader political impact; without a clear grasp of the\nconditions under which autocoups occur, efforts to prevent or mitigate their\nharmful effects remain severely constrained.\n\nAlthough autocoups differ fundamentally from classical coups—in particular, in\nbeing orchestrated by incumbents rather than external challengers—the two\nphenomena share essential features as disruptions to the established political\norder. Accordingly, the methodological tools commonly applied to the study of\ntraditional coups may be fruitfully adapted to the analysis of autocoups.\nHowever, despite the extensive literature on coup dynamics [@gassebner2016],\nregime type is frequently treated as a background condition or control variable,\nrather than as a central explanatory factor.\n\nThis research contends that the likelihood of an autocoup attempt is\nsignificantly influenced by the structural distribution of power embedded within\nregime type. Unlike classical coups, which often arise in contexts marked by\ncontested or fragmented authority, autocoups tend to occur in regimes\ncharacterised by concentrated and stabilised power. Given the difficulty of\ndirectly measuring internal power dynamics, regime type is employed as a proxy\nvariable. The underlying assumption is that regime type reflects core\ninstitutional arrangements—such as the distribution of authority, the strength of\nconstitutional constraints, and the incumbent’s capacity to subvert democratic\nnorms. Examining variation across regime types thus facilitates a more nuanced\nunderstanding of the institutional foundations that condition the risk of\nautocoups. These power structures are generally stable over time, as they both\nshape and are shaped by the regime’s overarching institutional design\n[@geddes2014].\n\nDrawing upon a refined conceptualisation of autocoups and an original global\ndataset encompassing autocoup events from 1945 to 2023, this study aims to make a\nsubstantive contribution through a quantitative analysis of the determinants of\nautocoup attempts.\n\nTo empirically assess this proposition, the study utilises both a standard\nlogistic regression model and a bias-reduced logistic regression model to\nevaluate how regime type influences the probability of incumbents seeking to\nextend their tenure through extra-constitutional means. Given the scarcity of\nquantitative research on autocoups, this investigation offers a potentially\npioneering contribution to the literature by providing a theoretically grounded\nand methodologically robust analysis of their underlying determinants.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the\nrefined conceptualisation of autocoups and the original autocoup dataset; Section\n3 explores the dynamics and outcomes of autocoup attempts; Section 4 outlines the\nresearch design, including methodological approach and variable selection;\nSection 5 presents and interprets the empirical findings, highlighting key\npatterns and implications; and Section 6 concludes by summarising the main\ninsights and reflecting on their broader relevance for understanding and\nmitigating the risks associated with autocoups.\n\n### Autocoup Conceptualisation and Dataset\n\n## Dynamics of autocoup attempts\n\nLike traditional coup attempts, autocoups are shaped by two fundamental elements:\nthe disposition of incumbent leaders—referring to their motivations and\nwillingness to act—and their capability, defined by the resources and\nopportunities at their disposal. However, autocoups exhibit two notable features\nthat distinguish them from classical coups. First, whereas traditional coups\noccur predominantly in autocracies [@thyne2014], over one-third of documented\nautocoups have taken place in democratic regimes, as outlined in Chapter 2.\nSecond, while the success rate of traditional coups hovers around $50\\%$, more\nthan $77\\%$ of autocoup attempts have resulted in success, according to the\ndataset introduced in Chapter 2. These distinctions indicate that the dynamics of\ndisposition and capability underlying autocoups differ significantly from those\nof traditional coups.\n\nThis section explores the complex dynamics of autocoup attempts, with particular\nemphasis on how the motivations of incumbents, the determinants of success, and\nthe institutional frameworks of various regime types shape the vulnerability of\nstates to such extra-constitutional power extensions.\n\n### Motivations for autocoups\n\n#### Motivations for autocoups\n\nIncumbents seeking to prolong their tenure may be driven by a range of\nmotivations, broadly falling into three principal categories: personal ambition,\nappeals to national interest, and self-preservation.\n\nFirst, the pursuit of personal power constitutes a compelling incentive for many\nleaders. The capacity to govern free from institutional constraints enables\nincumbents to exercise dominance over national policy-making, access state\nresources, influence the judiciary and legislature, and retain the prestige\nassociated with holding high office. For some, the aspiration to secure a lasting\npolitical legacy—to be remembered as a transformative figure—further amplifies\nthe appeal of extended rule.\n\nSecond, tenure extensions are often justified by incumbents in the name of the\nnational interest. A commonly advanced rationale suggests that a single term is\ninsufficient for the completion of long-term reforms or development initiatives.\nWithin this narrative, remaining in power is portrayed as essential to ensuring\nthe continuity and success of ongoing projects. The autocoup is thus framed not\nas an act of self-interest, but as a necessary step for the greater good.\n\nThird, autocoups may serve as mechanisms of self-preservation. Incumbents facing\nthe prospect of prosecution for corruption, human rights violations, or other\ntransgressions may view continued tenure as a means of preserving legal immunity.\nAdditionally, those who have amassed significant political adversaries during\ntheir rule may fear retribution upon leaving office. In such cases, the extension\nof power is not merely a product of ambition but also a strategy for\nsurvival—intended to shield the leader from legal or political repercussions.\n\n### Power dynamics and autocoups\n\nWhile motivations may initiate an incumbent’s decision to pursue an autocoup, the\ndecisive factor often lies in their ability to implement and sustain such an\naction. The relatively high frequency and remarkable success rate of\nautocoups—over $77\\%$, compared to approximately $50\\%$ for classical\ncoups—suggest that incumbents benefit from notable structural advantages when\nattempting to consolidate power. These advantages are not limited to autocracies\nbut are also evident in democratic systems, underscoring the variation in\ninstitutional leverage available to incumbents across different regime types.\n\nThis reality necessitates a closer examination of state power structures,\nparticularly the allocation of control over the military. The allegiance of the\narmed forces is a critical determinant of autocoup outcomes. If the military\nremains loyal to the executive, resistance—whether from civil society, the\njudiciary, or the legislature—can be suppressed or marginalised. Conversely, open\ndefiance or refusal by the military to support the incumbent may render an\nautocoup untenable.\n\nNevertheless, it is reductive to assume that formal authority as\ncommander-in-chief guarantees unqualified control. Just as it is overly\nsimplistic to attribute the success of traditional coups solely to the presence\nof military force [@singh2016], it is equally erroneous to presume that\nincumbents invariably enjoy the unconditional loyalty of the armed forces.\nNominal titles often obscure the complex and sometimes precarious dynamics\nunderpinning military allegiance.\n\nIn autocratic regimes, while the military may not be bound by constitutional\nprinciples, it is not inherently loyal to the head of state. Executives depend on\nmilitary officers to execute their commands; however, these officers may harbour\nindependent political ambitions or competing loyalties. A case in point is Uganda\nin 1971, when President Milton Obote attempted to dismiss General Idi Amin. In\nresponse, Amin exploited his influence within the armed forces to mount a\nsuccessful coup, ousting Obote [@sudduth2017].\n\nBy contrast, in consolidated democracies, military loyalty is typically\ninstitutionalised through allegiance to the constitution rather than to\nindividual officeholders. For example, in the United States, following the 2020\npresidential election, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\nStaff, publicly reaffirmed the military’s constitutional commitment: “We are\nunique among militaries. We do not take an oath to a king or a queen, a tyrant or\na dictator. We do not take an oath to an individual. We take an oath to the\nConstitution.” (US Army Museum, 12 November 2020\\[\\^1\\])\n\nIn hybrid regimes or fragile democracies, attempts to prolong executive tenure\nmay entail significant political risks. In Niger, for example, President Mamadou\nTandja’s attempt in 2009 to amend the constitution to permit a third term\nprecipitated a military coup in 2010 [@miller2016]. Similarly, in Honduras the\nsame year, President Manuel Zelaya was removed from office by the military after\nseeking to alter the constitution to allow immediate re-election\n[@muñoz-portillo2019].\n\n### Regime types and autocoups\n\nGiven the complexities discussed, a more effective analytical strategy entails\nevaluating the broader balance of power within political systems. As direct\nobservation of this balance is inherently challenging, this study adopts regime\ntype as a proxy—an approach consistent with established methodologies in\ncomparative politics. Regime types encapsulate the institutional architecture of\npower distribution, particularly with respect to control over the military,\npolitical appointments, and policy-making authority.\n\nFollowing the typology developed by @geddes2014, autocratic regimes can be\ncategorised as follows:\n\n**Military regimes** are governed by a junta, typically comprising senior\nmilitary officers who collectively determine leadership and policy direction.\nNotable examples include Brazil (1964–1985), Argentina (1976–1983), and El\nSalvador (1948–1984) [@geddes1999].\n\n**Personalist regimes** revolve around a dominant individual who wields unchecked\nauthority over the military, policy decisions, and succession processes.\nProminent instances include Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic\n(1930–1961), Idi Amin in Uganda (1971–1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa in the\nCentral African Republic (1966–1979) [@geddes1999].\n\n**Dominant-party regimes** concentrate authority within a structured political\nparty, with the leader operating either as part of or at the helm of the party\napparatus. Illustrative cases include the PRI in Mexico, CCM in Tanzania, and the\nLeninist parties of Eastern Europe [@geddes1999].\n\nAmong these regime types, personalist autocracies are particularly conducive to\nautocoups. The concentration of power in a single individual weakens\ninstitutional checks and fosters loyalty—particularly from the military—through\nmechanisms of personal patronage. While military regimes are rooted in coercive\npower, they are often beset by internal factionalism, rendering them more\nsusceptible to traditional coups than to autocoups. Dominant-party regimes occupy\na more ambiguous position: although party structures can constrain executive\naction, exceptionally powerful party leaders may still initiate autocoups, as\nexemplified by Xi Jinping’s constitutional amendments in 2018 within a\ndominant-party framework.\n\nMonarchies, though technically autocratic, generally render autocoups redundant,\nas monarchs typically rule for life by constitutional design.\n\nA key clarification is warranted at this juncture: why might leaders in\npersonalist regimes—already possessing extensive authority—feel compelled to\nextend their tenure further? The answer lies in distinguishing between the scope\nand duration of power. While such leaders may exercise considerable de facto\ncontrol over state institutions, many initially assume office via legal or\nconstitutional channels, necessitating a gradual process of consolidation. In\nthis context, autocoups function as formal mechanisms to institutionalise\nexisting dominance—transforming informal power into legally sanctioned\npermanence. This dynamic is exemplified by the repeated tenure extensions pursued\nby Vladimir Putin and Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nIn post-Soviet Russia, President Boris Yeltsin presided over the transformation\nof a parliamentary system into a personalist regime. However, Yeltsin himself did\nnot overstay his term; instead, he designated Vladimir Putin as his successor.\nUpon assuming office in 2000, Putin progressively entrenched his authority,\nemploying constitutional amendments and legal strategies to circumvent term\nlimits and extend his rule indefinitely.\n\nLikewise, in Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko was elected president in 1994 under a\nparty-based system. Within a year, he dismantled the existing institutional\nframework and established a personalist regime. Since then, he has remained in\npower through successive tenure extensions, steadily consolidating his control\nover the state apparatus.\n\nIn democratic contexts, autocoups are found exclusively in presidential systems.\nThis reflects the institutional leverage enjoyed by presidents, who are directly\nelected, typically command the armed forces, and may possess the capacity to\noverride or circumvent legislative opposition. By contrast, prime ministers in\nparliamentary systems are considerably more constrained. Their tenure depends on\nmaintaining legislative confidence and they may be removed through votes of no\nconfidence. Moreover, they often lack direct control over the military, which is\ninstitutionally separated from their office. As a result, prime ministers are\nsubject to more frequent leadership turnover and face fewer opportunities to\nunilaterally extend their mandates. For instance, the United Kingdom saw three\nprime ministers serve in 2022 alone, while Japan has had 36 prime ministers since\n1945—an average of one every two years. In contrast, only 14 presidents have\nserved in the United States over the same period, reflecting greater\ninstitutional continuity. These structural distinctions render presidential\nsystems more conducive to autocoups—even within well-established democracies—due\nto their centralised executive authority and command over the military.\n\nFrom this analysis, the following hypothesis is proposed:\n\nThe likelihood of autocoup attempts is significantly shaped by regime type, with\nregimes characterised by concentrated and stable executive power—namely,\npersonalist autocracies and presidential democracies—being the most susceptible,\nrelative to other regime types.\n\n***H3-1: The likelihood of autocoup attempts is significantly shaped by regime\ntype, with regimes characterised by concentrated and stable executive\npower—namely, personalist autocracies and presidential democracies—being the most\nsusceptible, relative to other regime types.***\n\n## Research design\n\n### Methodology\n\nGiven the binary nature of the dependent variable—namely, whether an autocoup is\nattempted in a given country-year—the study initially employs a logistic\nregression model to investigate the determinants of autocoup attempts. This\nmethod enables the identification of statistically significant factors\ninfluencing the likelihood of such events, as well as the direction and magnitude\nof their effects.\n\nNevertheless, the rarity of autocoup incidents—83 cases out of over 9,000\nobservations—poses a methodological challenge. Standard maximum likelihood\nestimation techniques, including conventional logit and probit models, are prone\nto underestimating the probability of rare events. To mitigate this limitation\nand improve the robustness of statistical inference, the analysis also employs\nFirth’s Bias-Reduced Penalised Maximum Likelihood Estimation (commonly referred\nto as Bias-Reduced Logit), as outlined by @firth1993.\n\n### Data and variables\n\nThe primary dataset, which incorporates information on autocoups and regime\ntypes, spans the period from 1945 to 2023. However, due to data alignment\nlimitations, the usable data range extends from 1945 to 2018. The dataset\ncomprises approximately 9,400 country-year observations, of which 83 represent\nrecorded autocoup attempts.\n\n#### Dependent variable\n\nThe analysis draws upon the autocoup dataset introduced in Chapter 2, which\ncovers the period from 1945 to 2023 and includes 83 documented autocoup attempts.\nSummary statistics for these events, as well as the corresponding regime\nclassifications, are presented in Chapter 2.\n\n**Autocoup attempt**: A binary variable indicating whether an autocoup attempt\noccurred (coded as 1) or did not occur (coded as 0) in each country-year\nobservation.\n\n#### Independent variables\n\nThe principal independent variable in this analysis is regime type, reflecting\nthe central analytical focus of the study. Regime classifications are drawn from\nthe typology developed by @geddes2014 (GWF dataset), which distinguishes among\nmilitary, personalist, and dominant-party regimes within autocratic systems. For\ndemocratic systems, regimes are categorised as either parliamentary or\npresidential. A residual category—labelled “other”—captures regimes that are\nprovisional, transitional, or otherwise not easily classified within the primary\ntypology.\n\nIn addition to regime type, a range of control variables is included, selected on\nthe basis of established scholarship on the determinants of coups. These controls\naccount for factors such as economic performance, political violence, and the\ntenure of incumbents. Further controls comprise the level of democracy,\npopulation size, and a Cold War dummy variable, which captures temporal variation\nin the global political environment.\n\n**Economic Level:** Measured by GDP per capita, this variable reflects the\noverall economic wellbeing of a country. Data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset\n[@fariss2022] and are expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP, per\nthousand).\n\n**Economic Performance:** Operationalised via the Current-Trend (CT) ratio\ndeveloped by @krishnarajan2019, this measure compares current GDP per capita with\nthe average of the previous five years. Higher CT values indicate stronger\neconomic growth. Formally:\n\n$$\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    CT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n    \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n**Political violence:** Measured using a violence index based on the “actotal”\nvariable from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset\n[@marshall2005current], this index captures both internal and interstate\nconflict. Scores range from 0 (complete stability) to 18 (maximum instability).\n\n**Days in office (log):** The natural logarithm of an incumbent leader’s\ncumulative days in office is included as a proxy for power consolidation. Longer\ntenures are hypothesised to facilitate the conditions necessary for an autocoup.\nData are drawn from the Archigos dataset [@goemans2009] and the Political\nLeaders’ Affiliation Database (PLAD) [@bomprezzi2024wedded].\n\n**Democratic level:** This variable employs the Polity V score to measure the\ndegree of democracy in a country, ranging from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10\n(fully democratic). The index, developed by the Centre for Systemic Peace,\nassesses regime characteristics such as the competitiveness of political\nparticipation, executive recruitment, and constraints on executive authority\n[@marshall2005current].\n\n**Population size:** The natural logarithm of a country’s population is included\nto account for the potential effects of demographic scale on governance. Larger\npopulations may present more complex administrative challenges and generate\ngreater opposition. Data are sourced from the V-Dem dataset.\n\n**Cold War:** Following the precedent of earlier studies [@thyne2014;\n@derpanopoulos2016; @dahl2023], a dummy variable is included to distinguish the\nCold War period (approximately 1960–1990) from the post-Cold War era. This\ndistinction reflects the relative paucity of autocoup events during the Cold War\nand their increased frequency thereafter.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\nThis chapter employs logistic regression techniques to examine the structural and\ncontextual factors that influence the probability of autocoup attempts. Given the\ndichotomous nature of the dependent variable—whether or not an autocoup attempt\noccurred in a specific country-year—and the rarity of such events (78 out of\n9,434 observations) in certain categories, the analysis includes both a standard\nlogit model and a bias-reduced logit model. The latter is particularly\nwell-suited for rare events data, as it corrects for the small-sample bias often\nencountered with conventional maximum likelihood estimation. Consequently, the\ninterpretation of results prioritises estimates from the bias-reduced model. Odds\nRatios (ORs) are reported to facilitate an intuitive understanding of effect\nsizes.\n\n@tbl-autocoupmodel presents the model estimates. The core hypothesis posits that\nregime type is a key predictor of autocoup incidence, particularly that\npersonalist regimes and presidential democracies are significantly more prone to\nsuch events than dominant-party regimes, which serve as the reference category.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-autocoupmodel .cell tbl-cap='Determinants of Autocoup Attempts(1945-2018)'}\n\\begin{table}\n\\fontsize{9.8pt}{11.7pt}\\selectfont\n\\begin{tabular*}{\\linewidth}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}lcccccccc}\n\\toprule\n & \\multicolumn{5}{c}{Standard Logit} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{Bias-reduced Logit} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule(lr){2-6} \\cmidrule(lr){7-9}\n\\textbf{Characteristic} & \\textbf{N} & \\textbf{Event N} & \\textbf{log(OR)}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}} & \\textbf{OR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}} & \\textbf{SE} & \\textbf{log(OR)}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}} & \\textbf{OR}\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}} & \\textbf{SE} \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nConstant & 9,434 & 78 & -4.7** & 0.01** & 0.02 & -4.6*** & 0.01*** & 1.77 \\\\ \nRegime Type &  &  &  &  &  &  &  &  \\\\ \n    Dominant Party & 2,312 & 19 & — & — & — & — & — & — \\\\ \n    Personal & 1,308 & 26 & 0.74** & 2.10** & 0.65 & 0.73** & 2.08** & 0.30 \\\\ \n    Presidential & 1,642 & 27 & 1.6*** & 5.01*** & 2.42 & 1.6*** & 4.87*** & 0.47 \\\\ \n    Military & 630 & 2 & -0.80 & 0.45 & 0.34 & -0.62 & 0.54 & 0.67 \\\\ \n    Parliamentary & 2,368 & 1 & -1.7 & 0.18 & 0.20 & -1.4 & 0.26 & 0.92 \\\\ \n    Other & 1,174 & 3 & -1.2* & 0.30* & 0.19 & -1.1* & 0.34* & 0.58 \\\\ \nGDP per capita & 9,434 & 78 & -0.01 & 0.99 & 0.01 & -0.01 & 0.99 & 0.01 \\\\ \nGDP growth trend & 9,434 & 78 & 0.91 & 2.49 & 3.47 & 0.97 & 2.64 & 1.33 \\\\ \nPolitical violence & 9,434 & 78 & 0.01 & 1.01 & 0.07 & 0.03 & 1.03 & 0.06 \\\\ \nLog of Population & 9,434 & 78 & -0.14 & 0.87 & 0.08 & -0.15* & 0.86* & 0.09 \\\\ \nPolity V scores & 9,434 & 78 & -0.09*** & 0.91*** & 0.03 & -0.09*** & 0.91*** & 0.03 \\\\ \nLog of days in office & 9,434 & 78 & 0.01 & 1.01 & 0.13 & 0.00 & 1.00 & 0.12 \\\\ \nCold war &  &  & -0.80*** & 0.45*** & 0.12 & -0.79*** & 0.45*** & 0.26 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular*}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}}*p\\textless{}0.1; **p\\textless{}0.05; ***p\\textless{}0.01\\\\\nAbbreviations: CI = Confidence Interval, OR = Odds Ratio, SE = Standard Error\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\end{table}\n:::\n\n\nThe empirical results provide robust support for this hypothesis. In the\nbias-reduced model, the odds of an autocoup occurring in a personalist regime are\nmore than twice as high as in a dominant-party regime (OR = 2.08, p \\< 0.05). In\npresidential democracies, the odds are nearly five times greater (OR = 4.87, p \\<\n0.01). To illustrate the magnitude of these effects, I compute predicted\nprobabilities for a prototypical country in the dataset, holding all other\ncovariates at their mean values. In dominant-party regimes, the predicted\nprobability of an autocoup in a given year is approximately $0.99\\%$. In\npersonalist regimes, the probability rises to around $2.0\\%$. In presidential\ndemocracies, the likelihood increases further to approximately $4.7\\%$. While\nthese probabilities are low in absolute terms—reflecting the rarity of autocoup\nevents—the relative differences are substantial. Leaders in presidential\ndemocracies, for instance, are nearly five times more likely to attempt an\nautocoup than those in dominant-party systems, holding other factors constant.\nThis underscores the structural vulnerability of executive-centric political\nsystems, particularly when institutional checks on executive power are weak.\n\nAmong other regime types, military and parliamentary democracies do not show\nstatistically significant differences in autocoup likelihood relative to\ndominant-party regimes. The residual \"other\" category does reach marginal\nsignificance (OR = 0.34, p \\< 0.1), suggesting lower odds, although the\nheterogeneity within this group warrants cautious interpretation.\n\nTurning to the control variables, several findings warrant closer attention. The\nPolity V score, which proxies the level of democratic institutionalisation, is\nsignificantly associated with reduced odds of autocoup (OR = 0.91, p \\< 0.01).\nSubstantively, this indicates that for each one-point increase in Polity score,\nthe odds of an autocoup decrease by approximately $9\\%$, holding other factors\nconstant. This underscores the protective role of democratic institutions against\nexecutive overreach.\n\nThe Cold War indicator also emerges as significant (OR = 0.45, p \\< 0.01),\nsuggesting that autocoups were $55\\%$ less likely during the Cold War era than in\nthe post-Cold War period. This aligns with historical interpretations that view\nthe Cold War as imposing external constraints on authoritarian innovation, often\nvia superpower influence.\n\nThe analysis reveals a statistically significant, albeit marginal, negative\nrelationship between the log of population size and the incidence of autocoups\n(OR = 0.86, p \\< 0.1). This suggests that as a country's population grows, the\nodds of an autocoup tend to decrease. This finding aligns with theoretical\narguments positing that larger, more populous states may exhibit greater\norganizational complexity and higher visibility of executive power dynamics,\nthereby increasing the difficulty and scrutiny associated with an executive power\ngrab.\n\nConversely, indicators of economic performance—including GDP per capita, GDP\ngrowth, and political violence—do not exhibit statistically significant\nrelationships with the outcome variable. Likewise, the log of days in office for\nthe incumbent does not significantly predict autocoup attempts, suggesting that\ntenure alone is not a sufficient condition for extra-constitutional moves.\n\nIn sum, the analysis confirms that regime type—particularly personalist and\npresidential systems—is a critical structural condition influencing the\nlikelihood of autocoup attempts. The inclusion of predicted probabilities and\npercentage changes in odds ratios serves to clarify the substantive significance\nof these patterns, beyond their statistical robustness. These results point to\nthe institutional fragility of regimes where executive authority is highly\ncentralised and unchecked. Additionally, the protective effects of democratic\ninstitutions and Cold War-era international structures warrant greater attention\nin discussion of executive stability and regime resilience. The implications of\nthese findings for policy and democratic governance will be explored in detail in\nthe final chapter.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis chapter provides a quantitative analysis of the determinants of autocoup\nattempts, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature, which has often\nbeen hindered by conceptual imprecision and the absence of systematic empirical\ndata. It advances the central argument that the likelihood of autocoup attempts\nis shaped significantly by the structural configuration of political power within\nregimes, operationalised through regime type. Employing both standard logistic\nregression and Firth’s bias-reduced logit model, the analysis demonstrates that\npersonalist autocracies and presidential democracies are markedly more\nsusceptible to autocoup attempts than dominant-party regimes. Specifically, the\nodds of an autocoup are estimated to be approximately three times higher in\npersonalist autocracies and nearly five times higher in presidential democracies\nrelative to the baseline category.\n\nThese findings lend empirical support to the hypothesis that such regime types\npossess structural vulnerabilities that facilitate extra-constitutional power\nconsolidation by incumbents. In addition to regime type, the analysis identifies\nseveral other statistically significant covariates: population size, the degree\nof democratic institutionalisation, and the broader historical context of the\nCold War all exert discernible effects on the probability of autocoup occurrence.\nBy examining the strategic incentives confronting incumbent leaders across\ndiverse institutional contexts, the study contributes to a more nuanced\nunderstanding of irregular leadership transitions.\n\nNevertheless, the analysis also underscores several conceptual and methodological\nchallenges that warrant further investigation. Unlike traditional coups—which may\noccur at various stages of a regime’s lifespan and are often subject to\nrecurrence—autocoups appear to follow distinct temporal patterns. For instance,\ntheir likelihood may be comparatively low during the initial stages of a leader’s\ntenure, increasing as the conclusion of a constitutional term approaches.\nMoreover, while a successful extension of tenure may reduce the short-term risk\nof subsequent attempts, empirical cases such as those of Presidents Putin and\nLukashenko suggest that incumbents may engage in serial autocoup behaviour.\n\nTo render the analysis tractable, this study adopts the simplifying assumption\nthat an autocoup attempt occurs only once per leadership tenure. While\nanalytically expedient, this assumption highlights the need for future research\nto explore the temporal dynamics and sequencing of autocoup activity. Such\ninquiries would usefully complement the present findings by offering deeper\ninsights into the long-term patterns of institutional adaptation, authoritarian\ndurability, and democratic erosion.\n",
