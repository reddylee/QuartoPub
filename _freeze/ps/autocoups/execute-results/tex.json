By employing a sample selection model, the research explores the effects of economic performance, the post-Cold War era, regime types, and levels of democracy on overstay attempts. Furthermore, it examines the influence of incumbency advantages on the likelihood of successful overstay attempts. Through a quantitative analysis based on a new dataset of overstays, this study contributes to the existing literature by offering valuable insights into the determinants of overstay attempts and their outcomes.\n  \nkeywords: [Coups, Autocoups, Political Leadership]\n\nexecute:\n  warning: false\n  message: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen political leaders assume power, they can exit in three main ways: being\ncompelled to leave office before their term expires (ousted or forced to resign),\nsuccessfully completing their full term and stepping down[^1], or overstaying in\npower through illegitimate means.\n\nUnsurprisingly, irregular exits, particularly the first type, have garnered\nsignificant academic attention. According to @goemans2009, out of 374 leaders who\nexited irregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, accounting for 65.8% of these\ncases. @frantz2016 shows that coup-related exits account for roughly one-third of\nall exits in autocracies, surpassing any other type, including regular\ntransitions. Given the prevalence of coups as the primary form of irregular\nexits, much research has focused on this phenomenon.\n\nWhile previous literature has primarily concentrated on irregular entries and\nexits, there has been comparatively less attention given to **irregular\noverstays**, where leaders overstay their term despite legal requirements such as\nterm limits, losing elections, or impeachment. Therefore, it is worth studying\nirregular overstays to analyse why some political leaders exit regularly\naccording to their term limits, while others attempt to overstay in office, and\nwhy some leaders successfully overstay in power, while others fail in their\nattempts. The significance of this topic is based on the following reasons:\n\nFirstly, coups have become less common since 2000. Since 1990, there has been a\nsignificant decline in cases of incumbent political leaders being ousted before\ntheir legal term limits. The risk of coups, for example, has been remarkably\nreduced [@bermeo2016; @thyne2019]. As shown in @tbl-coup_year_counts, the top 10\nleast frequent years of coups, except for 1950, are all after 1990, while the top\n10 most frequent years of coups, except for 1991, are all before 1990.\n\nHowever, irregular overstays have become more frequent since 2000. In July 2020,\nRussia overwhelmingly passed a referendum amending the Russian Constitution,\nallowing President Vladimir Putin, who has been in power since 1999, to remain in\noffice until 2036[^2]. Similarly, in March 2018, China's National People's\nCongress (NPC) removed the two-term limit on the presidency from China's\nConstitution, effectively enabling Xi Jinping to potentially remain in power\nindefinitely[^3]. Even the United States, often considered a well-established\ndemocracy, faced a potential risk of self-coup following the 2020 election\n[@antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022]. Previous studies indicate that roughly 20 to 30\npercent of political leaders have extended their terms through various\nmeans[@ginsburg2010evasion; @baturo2014]. More recent research highlights an even\nmore concerning trend, showing that since 2000, approximately half of the rulers\nin non-democratic countries have attempted to overstay in their positions\n[@versteeg2020law]. Alarmingly, a considerable number of these overstay attempts\nhave been successful.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coup_year_counts .cell tbl-cap='Coups frequency by year (1950-2023)'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begingroup\n\\setlength\\LTleft{0.025\\linewidth}\n\\setlength\\LTright{0.025\\linewidth}\\fontsize{12.0pt}{14.4pt}\\selectfont\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{@{\\extracolsep{\\fill}}cccc}\n\\toprule\nLeast Frequency Years & Least Counts & Most Frequency Years & Most Counts \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\n1998 & 1 & 1966 & 18 \\\\ \n2020 & 1 & 1963 & 16 \\\\ \n2017 & 1 & 1975 & 16 \\\\ \n2016 & 1 & 1965 & 15 \\\\ \n2013 & 1 & 1991 & 14 \\\\ \n1950 & 2 & 1962 & 14 \\\\ \n2009 & 2 & 1960 & 12 \\\\ \n2002 & 2 & 1978 & 12 \\\\ \n2005 & 2 & 1981 & 11 \\\\ \n2011 & 2 & 1961 & 11 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\emph{\\textbf{Source: GIC dataset}}\\\\\n\\end{minipage}\n\\endgroup\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSecondly, while the negative outcomes of coups, such as societal turmoil and\ndemocratic decline, have been widely discussed, the negative outcomes of\nirregular overstays have not received enough attention, despite being at least as\nsignificant. Although coups can sometimes end the worst regimes or chaos and have\nbeen debated for their potential benefits to democracy [@derpanopoulos2016;\n@miller2016; @derpanopoulos2017; @lumjiak2018], for example, the coup in Niger in\n2010 resolved a constitutional crisis, ended turmoil, and promoted democracy\n[@derpanopoulos2016].\n\nIrregular overstays, however, are typically accompanied by the abuse of power,\ndefiance of legitimate authority, violation of the rule of law, destruction of\npolitical conventions, and damage to checks and balances. Successful overstays\nalmost always lead to democratic backsliding or autocratic deterioration. Even\nunsuccessful overstays often spark protests, strikes, riots, insurgencies,\nrebellions, coups, or, even worse, civil wars. As overstays undermine formal\ninstitutions or violate informal norms of power transition, they significantly\nincrease the risk of irregular power transitions in the future. Research\nindicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of irregular stayed leaders\nin non-democratic countries were either ousted or assassinated while in office\n[@baturo2019].\n\nDespite its high frequency and severe consequences, irregular overstays has\nreceived comparatively less attention compared to the extensive research\nconducted on the irregular exits of political leaders since the early 2000s\n[@thyne2019]. The limited existing studies on irregular overstays have primarily\nrelied on case studies [@cameron1998; @antonio2021; @pion-berlin2022], and few\nhave been focused on quantitative analyses.\n\nThis study aims to address these issues and contribute in three areas. Firstly,\nit clarifies and redefines the concept of autocoups in terms of irregular\noverstays, establishing a new dataset of autocoups since 1945. Secondly, it\nhighlights the significant academic value of autocoups in the context of\nirregular overstays, similar to the value of coups in irregular entry and exits.\nThirdly, it enhances the existing body of knowledge by conducting a quantitative\nanalysis on the determinants of autocoups.\n\nThe subsequent section will provide a comprehensive overview of the definition\nand typology of the dataset on overstays. This will be followed by a presentation\nof relevant theories and hypotheses that examine the factors influencing overstay\nattempts and their outcomes. The research design will be outlined in Part IV,\ndetailing the data and methodology employed to test the hypotheses. The results\nof the analysis will be discussed in Part V, providing a thorough examination of\nthe findings. Finally, the paper will conclude in Part VI, summarizing the key\ninsights gained from the study and suggesting avenues for future research.\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n## References\n\n\n\n[^1]: For lifelong rulers, such as those in monarchies or de facto hereditary\n    regimes, leaders typically exit power only upon their death.\n\n[^2]: Referendum In Russia Passes, Allowing Putin To Remain President Until 2036:\n    <https://www.npr.org/2020/07/01/886440694/referendum-in-russia-passes-allowing-putin-to-remain-president-until-2036>,\n    accessed on October 15, 2022.\n\n[^3]: China's Xi allowed to remain 'president for life' as term limits removed:\n    <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-43361276>, accessed on Octbor\n    15, 2022.\n",
