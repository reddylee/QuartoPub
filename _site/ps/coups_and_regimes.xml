      <abstract>
        <p>A substantial body of research has examined coups, with much of it
focusing on the factors that lead to coup attempts. However, consensus
remains elusive regarding why coups are more prevalent in certain
countries while less so in others. Previous scholarship exploring the
determinants of coup attempts has often overlooked the crucial aspect of
coup success. Given the severe consequences of a failed coup, coup
plotters are unlikely to proceed unless they perceive a high probability
of success. Thus, the outcome of a coup—whether successful or
unsuccessful—is not merely incidental but serves as a pivotal
determinant of coup attempts. The decision to stage a coup is a
self-selected variable contingent upon the anticipated success rate of
coups. This study employs a sample selection model (specifically, a
two-stage probit model) to elucidate why coups are more common in some
autocratic countries but rare in others. I contend that coup attempts
are largely shaped by the likelihood of coup success, which, in turn,
hinges on the power dynamics between coup perpetrators and incumbents.
These power dynamics are influenced by the regime type and their
distinct responses to internal and external shocks.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Coups<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> are more frequently in
  some countries but rarely in others. According to Global Instances of
  Coups
  (<xref alt="Powell and Thyne 2011" rid="ref-powell2011" ref-type="bibr">Powell
  and Thyne 2011</xref>, hereinafter GIC), in Latin America, coups
  occurred 23 times in Bolivia from 1950 to 1984, and 20 times in
  Argentina in almost the same period. In Mexico’s authoritarian period
  from 1917 to 2000, however, no coup occurred at all. In Africa, Sudan
  encountered 17 coups from 1955 to 2021, while no coup occurred in
  South Africa since 1950. Similar stories happened in the Middle East
  and south Asia. Previous studies have tried to explain these
  disparities from different perspectives. “About one hundred potential
  determinants of coups have been proposed, but no consensus has emerged
  on an established baseline model for analyzing coups”
  (<xref alt="Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt 2016" rid="ref-gassebner2016a" ref-type="bibr">Gassebner,
  Gutmann, and Voigt 2016</xref>). The question remains unanswered.</p>
      <p>To analyse determinants of coups, the most important characteristic
  of coups should not be overlooked. Coups are <bold>illegal</bold>
  attempts against the current leaders and the cost of failed coups
  could be too expensive to bear. Perpetrators of coups might be put to
  jail, forced to exile, or even sentenced to death if they fail.
  Sometimes even worse, the punishment might fall on the perpetrators’
  family. Although staging coups is so risky, there were still many
  coups occurred-484 coups have been launched since 1950 (GIC). In 2021,
  7 coups occurred in 6 countries, the most frequent year since
  2000<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref>.</p>
      <p>To understand the logic of perpetrators of coups, we need to
  analyse the pay-offs of coups. When a coup is launched, the
  perpetrators expect to earn something from the coup, not to lose,
  which depends on how likely they will succeed. Therefore, when coup
  plotters plan to stage a coup, the first and foremost thing they will
  consider is their likelihood of success. They might have many
  incentives to launch a coup, but they are less likely to put the plot
  into practice without some certainty of success. When the chances of
  success are low, coup plotters either abort their schemes or wait for
  better timing. It is hard to know the threshold of chances of success,
  but previous coups show that the success rates of staged coups are
  quite satisfactory (Table ). The most recent coups staged in 2021,
  with 5 successful coups out of 7 staged coups, show an even higher
  success rate.</p>
