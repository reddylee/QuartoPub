You might ask. The answer is that duckdb is faster than R for large datasets. As showed above, the query in duckdb is much faster than in R to get the same results.\nWe might not notice a significant difference in query execution speed in this example because the dataset is small. However, the discrepancy becomes more apparent with larger datasets. Let’s examine a big dataset to observe the contrast in query execution speed. We’ll use a dataset containing item checkouts from Seattle public libraries, accessible online at Seattle.\nWhen attempting to read the dataset with read_csv(), it may encounter considerable processing delays or even fail outright. This is primarily due to the dataset’s substantial size, comprising approximately 41,389,465 rows, spanning 12 columns, and occupying 9.21 GB of storage space. The following code would fail to read such voluminous data.\n```{r}\nread_csv(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv\") |&gt; \n  nrow()\n```\nLet’s try to query with duckdb.\n\nCodetic(\"sql\")\n\n\n\nCodeSelect Count(*)\nFrom read_csv('~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv')\n\n\n1 records\n\ncount_star()\n\n\n41389465\n\n\n\n\n\nCodetoc()\n\nsql: 6.207 sec elapsed\n\n\nDuckDB took a bit longer to retrieve the results, more than 4 seconds, but the performance was quite acceptable. It outperformed R, which failed to read the data altogether."

Patients were determined to be at high risk on the basis of validated patient- and procedure-related risk factors. The primary outcome was post-ERCP pancreatitis, which was defined as new upper abdominal pain, an elevation in pancreatic enzymes to at least three times the upper limit of the normal range 24 hours after the procedure, and hospitalization for at least 2 nights.\nRESULTS A total of 602 patients were enrolled and completed follow-up. The majority of patients (82%) had a clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Post-ERCP pancreatitis developed in 27 of 295 patients (9.2%) in the indomethacin group and in 52 of 307 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.005). Moderate-to-severe pancreatitis developed in 13 patients (4.4%) in the indomethacin group and in 27 patients (8.8%) in the placebo group (P=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, rectal indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of the condition.

    "section": "\n2 Literature review",
    "text": "2 Literature review\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science research for decades. This enduring interest stems from the vast variations observed across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Before delving deeper into the subject, it is crucial to distinguish between two distinct yet interconnected concepts: regime survival and individual leader survival.\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as monarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader survival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual leaders’ time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns. For example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific political parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders (Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see long-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a slower pace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some military regimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party and the head of government. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of individual leader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how long leaders remain in power.\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a wealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific mechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as democracies or autocracies. Others seek to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks that can explain leader survival across diverse political systems. While the development of a universal theory remains an alluring goal, it is important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in creating a single model that encompasses the complexities of leadership survival across all regime types.\nTransparent and inclusive vs. Opaque and exclusive\nFirst of all, the mechanisms governing power transitions differ dramatically in different countries, particularly between democracies and autocracies. The key distinctions in the leadership selection process can be characterized as follows: transparent vs. opaque and inclusive vs. exclusive.\nIn many autocratic systems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential candidates are often restricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families, military elites, or members of the ruling party. Selection processes are shrouded in secrecy, and dissent can be met with harsh consequences. Even elections exist in some autocracies, like Russia, there may have significant barriers to entry for legitimate challengers. Potential rivals may face threats like assassination, imprisonment, or exile.\nThis lack of transparency makes it difficult to gauge true levels of public support as in democracies. Calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as explored by Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003), becomes a near-impossible task. Leadership transitions in autocracies often hinge on internal power struggles rather than public opinion. A dictator may retain power despite low public support.\nIn contrast, democracies have relatively open competition for leadership positions. Challengers can openly campaign and garner support through public speeches, media campaigns, and grassroots movements. If no single candidate commands a majority, factions can collaborate, leading to power transitions with broader public backing. This allows for a more accurate assessment of power dynamics through public opinion polls and electoral performance.\nRegular and predictable vs. Irregular and unpredictable\nSecondly, beyond the differences in openness and inclusivity, leadership transitions in autocracies and some democracies are far more irregular and unpredictable compared to stable democracies.\nMany autocratic regimes lack institutionalized mechanisms for succession or term limits. A leader’s tenure often hinges on their ability to maintain control and consolidate power. Certain dictators maintain an indefinite grip on power until their death, subsequently transferring authority to family members, such as sons in the cases of Syria and North Korea, or brothers in Cuba. This can also lead to unexpected and irregular leadership changes. Leaders may be ousted through coups, rebellions, uprisings, or popular protests. The opacity surrounding power dynamics can also contribute to instability. Even seemingly strong leaders can be overthrown by a small, well-positioned faction within the regime. Take, for instance, Henri Namphy, who assumed the presidency of Haiti following a coup in June 1988, only to be ousted by another coup a mere three months later in September of the same year. However, Qaddafi, the dictator of Libya, seized power in a coup in 1969 and ruled for over 40 years before being killed in 2011 by NATO-backed rebel forces (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\nIn contrast, stable democracies experience regular and predictable leadership transitions. Formal institutions, such as term limits, set clear boundaries for how long leaders can remain in office. For example, US presidents are limited to a maximum of two terms, regardless of their popularity. Similarly, in autocratic Mexico from 1919 to 2000, each president served a fixed six-year term without facing overthrows or overstays, as noted by (Klesner 2019).\nThe study of political survival is particularly captivating due to the intricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular leadership transitions. While regular and anticipated leadership changes are important, they offer less fertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader longevity. The vast majority of leaders who assume power through established channels also exit power through established mechanisms (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009). This research delves into the factors influencing the survival of leaders who achieve power through irregular means, as these transitions often hinge on complex political calculations, power struggles, and unforeseen events.\nDue to the above discussions, the diverse mechanisms influencing political leadership survival have prompted scholars to delve deeper into regime-specific dynamics. For instance, research by Svolik (2014) examines democracies, while Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood (2021) focuses on autocracies. A particular more focus lies on understanding unexpected tenures, where leaders either fail to complete their terms or overstay their mandates.\nIn analysing dterminants of leader survival, two primary perspectives have been used to explain leader survival. The first considers contextual factors and resources available to leaders. These include elements like personal competence (Yu and Jong-A-Pin 2016), societal stability (Arriola 2009), economic development (Palmer and Whitten 1999; Williams 2011), access to natural resources (Smith 2004; Quiroz Flores and Smith 2012; Wright, Frantz, and Geddes 2013), and external support networks(Licht 2009; Wright 2008; Thyne et al. 2017). The second perspective explores the strategies leaders employ to implement their agendas. This includes both the leaders’ political goals and their responses to opposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions (Gandhi and Przeworski 2007; Morrison 2009; Escribà-Folch 2013; Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood 2021).\nUnsurprisingly, coups have received significant scholarly attention due to their role in removing authoritarian leaders (Svolik 2009; Frantz and Stein 2016). Existing research explores both strategies for thwarting coups (Powell 2017; Sudduth 2017a; De Bruin 2020) and how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup attempts (Easton and Siverson 2018). For example, Sudduth (2017b) examines the post-coup actions of dictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders initially hold more power than elites within the regime, making them less susceptible to subsequent coups. This challenges the conventional view of new leaders as inherently weak (Roessler 2011). Despite this distinction, both Sudduth and Roessler acknowledge that new leaders often consolidate power by purging rivals (Sudduth suggests this occurs when there is minimal risk, while Roessler argues it happens when threats are perceived). While the debate on the initial strength of coup leaders continues, both perspectives agree that early purges are more likely.\nSudduth and Bell (2018) investigates how leaders’ entry methods affect their removal in dictatorships. They argue that irregular entry does not necessarily increase the likelihood of removal. In fact, some forms of irregular entry may offer protection. However, their focus was on how leaders lose office, not how long they stay in power. Additionally, they compared six types of irregular leaders without specifically examining the distinction between coup-entry and autocoup leaders.\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts, including universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed challenges, a significant gap remains. There is a lack of research specifically exploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their tenures through autocoups compared to those who come to power through coups d’état. This study aims to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership survival between these two distinct leader types.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders"

However, two specific types of leaders - those who come to power through coups and those who overstay their legitimate terms (autocoup leaders) - have received comparatively less attention. Examining the tenures of these irregularly ascended leaders holds particular significance for two main reasons.\nFirstly, leaders who ascend through irregular means constitute the majority of irregular exits from power. According to Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009), between 1945 and 2015, out of 1,472 leaders who assumed office through regular channels, approximately 213 exited irregularly (14.5%). Conversely, out of 308 leaders who assumed office through irregular means, roughly 158 (51.3%) experienced irregular exits.\nSecondly, among irregularly ascended leaders, the majority gained power through launching coups or overstaying in office. As per Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009), out of 374 leaders who exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, constituting 65.8% of these cases. Additionally, between 1945 and 2020, there were 106 attempts to overstay in power, of which 86 were successful (Zhu2024?). Leaders who extend their legitimate term limits essentially stage coups against legitimate successors, thereby qualifying as autocoup leaders. Hence, it is both relevant and insightful to delve into and compare the tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders.\nWhile it is expected that autocoup leaders survive longer than coup-entry leaders when considering their total tenures, a more insightful comparison arises when examining the tenures following autocoups in contrast to those of coup-entry leaders. Conducting a log-rank test in survival analysis on the leaders dataset (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009) and the author’s autocoup dataset Zhu (2024)] reveals a distinct contrast between autocoup leaders and coup-entry leaders.\n\nCodeMydata1 &lt;- read.csv(here(\"data/mydata1.csv\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(survival_year = survival_time / 365)\n\navg &lt;- Mydata1 |&gt;\n  summarise(avg=round(mean(survival_year),1),\n            .by = group)\n\navg\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCode# Fit survival curves\nfit &lt;- survfit(Surv(survival_year, status) ~ group, data = Mydata1)\n# Create log-rank plot (Kaplan-Meier plot)\nggsurvplot(fit, \n           data = Mydata1, \n           risk.table = TRUE, \n           risk.table.height = 0.3, \n           pval = TRUE,\n           surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n           break.x.by = 5, \n           legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n           legend.labs = c(\"entry by autocoup\", \"entry by coup\"),\n           xlab = \"Survival Years\",\n           #title = \"Survival Curves of overstay and coup-entry leaders\",\n           font.title = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders\n\n\n\n\nPreliminary findings from survival analysis (see Figure 1) indicate a significant difference. Leaders who consolidate power through autocoups appear to have a longer average tenure after the autocoup itself (approximately 10.9) compared to coup leaders (approximately 5.3). This suggests a potential shortfall of 5 years in the average tenure of coup leaders.\nThus, we hypothesize that the method of accession significantly influences leadership longevity. Coup leaders likely face greater challenges to their legitimacy, leading to a more precarious initial period in power. They may encounter higher levels of uncertainty, instability, and pressure to share power, all of which could contribute to a shorter average tenure compared to autocoup leaders.\nBy employing the Cox proportional hazards model and the extended Cox model, the results suggest that leaders who exceed their term limits generally experience longer tenures compared to those who come to power through coups.\nThis study offers two key contributions. First, it highlights a critical factor often overlooked in leadership survival studies: the impact of accession method. Leaders’ survival is not solely determined by their actions after taking power, but also by the way they acquired power in the first place. This research underscores the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and coup leaders. Second, it provides empirical measurements to compare the tenure duration of these two irregularly ascended leaders, offering insights into their distinct impacts on leadership longevity.\nThe remainder of the paper delves deeper into this topic. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context for this research. Chapter 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of coup and autocoup leaders. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data used, including the application of survival models to analyse the determinants of leadership longevity. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a detailed discussion of the results. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by synthesizing the key takeaways and exploring their broader implications."

    "section": "\n2 Literature review",
    "text": "2 Literature review\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science research for decades. This enduring interest stems from the vast variations observed across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Before delving deeper into the subject, it is crucial to distinguish between two distinct yet interconnected concepts: regime survival and individual leader survival.\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as monarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader survival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual leaders’ time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns. For example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific political parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders (Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see long-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a slower pace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some military regimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party and the head of government. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of individual leader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how long leaders remain in power.\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a wealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific mechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as democracies or autocracies. Others seek to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks that can explain leader survival across diverse political systems. While the development of a universal theory remains an alluring goal, it is important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in creating a single model that encompasses the complexities of leadership survival across all regime types.\nTransparent and inclusive vs. Opaque and exclusive\nFirst of all, the mechanisms governing power transitions differ dramatically in different countries, particularly between democracies and autocracies. The key distinctions in the leadership selection process can be characterized as follows: transparent vs. opaque and inclusive vs. exclusive.\nIn many autocratic systems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential candidates are often restricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families, military elites, or members of the ruling party. Selection processes are shrouded in secrecy, and dissent can be met with harsh consequences. Even elections exist in some autocracies, like Russia, there may have significant barriers to entry for legitimate challengers. Potential rivals may face threats like assassination, imprisonment, or exile.\nThis lack of transparency makes it difficult to gauge true levels of public support as in democracies. Calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as explored by Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003), becomes a near-impossible task. Leadership transitions in autocracies often hinge on internal power struggles rather than public opinion. A dictator may retain power despite low public support.\nIn contrast, democracies have relatively open competition for leadership positions. Challengers can openly campaign and garner support through public speeches, media campaigns, and grassroots movements. If no single candidate commands a majority, factions can collaborate, leading to power transitions with broader public backing. This allows for a more accurate assessment of power dynamics through public opinion polls and electoral performance.\nRegular and predictable vs. Irregular and unpredictable\nSecondly, beyond the differences in openness and inclusivity, leadership transitions in autocracies and some democracies are far more irregular and unpredictable compared to stable democracies.\nMany autocratic regimes lack institutionalized mechanisms for succession or term limits. A leader’s tenure often hinges on their ability to maintain control and consolidate power. Certain dictators maintain an indefinite grip on power until their death, subsequently transferring authority to family members, such as sons in the cases of Syria and North Korea, or brothers in Cuba. This can also lead to unexpected and irregular leadership changes. Leaders may be ousted through coups, rebellions, uprisings, or popular protests. The opacity surrounding power dynamics can also contribute to instability. Even seemingly strong leaders can be overthrown by a small, well-positioned faction within the regime. Take, for instance, Henri Namphy, who assumed the presidency of Haiti following a coup in June 1988, only to be ousted by another coup a mere three months later in September of the same year. However, Qaddafi, the dictator of Libya, seized power in a coup in 1969 and ruled for over 40 years before being killed in 2011 by NATO-backed rebel forces (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\nIn contrast, stable democracies experience regular and predictable leadership transitions. Formal institutions, such as term limits, set clear boundaries for how long leaders can remain in office. For example, US presidents are limited to a maximum of two terms, regardless of their popularity. Similarly, in autocratic Mexico from 1919 to 2000, each president served a fixed six-year term without facing overthrows or overstays, as noted by (Klesner 2019).\nThe study of political survival is particularly captivating due to the intricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular leadership transitions. While regular and anticipated leadership changes are important, they offer less fertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader longevity. The vast majority of leaders who assume power through established channels also exit power through established mechanisms (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009). This research delves into the factors influencing the survival of leaders who achieve power through irregular means, as these transitions often hinge on complex political calculations, power struggles, and unforeseen events.\nDue to the above discussions, the diverse mechanisms influencing political leadership survival have prompted scholars to delve deeper into regime-specific dynamics. For instance, research by Svolik (2014) examines democracies, while Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood (2021) focuses on autocracies. A particular more focus lies on understanding unexpected tenures, where leaders either fail to complete their terms or overstay their mandates.\nIn analysing dterminants of leader survival, two primary perspectives have been used to explain leader survival. The first considers contextual factors and resources available to leaders. These include elements like personal competence (Yu and Jong-A-Pin 2016), societal stability (Arriola 2009), economic development (Palmer and Whitten 1999; Williams 2011), access to natural resources (Smith 2004; Quiroz Flores and Smith 2012; Wright, Frantz, and Geddes 2013), and external support networks(Licht 2009; Wright 2008; Thyne et al. 2017). The second perspective explores the strategies leaders employ to implement their agendas. This includes both the leaders’ political goals and their responses to opposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions (Gandhi and Przeworski 2007; Morrison 2009; Escribà-Folch 2013; Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood 2021).\nUnsurprisingly, coups have received significant scholarly attention due to their role in removing authoritarian leaders (Svolik 2009; Frantz and Stein 2016). Existing research explores both strategies for thwarting coups (Powell 2017; Sudduth 2017a; De Bruin 2020) and how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup attempts (Easton and Siverson 2018). For example, Sudduth (2017b) examines the post-coup actions of dictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders initially hold more power than elites within the regime, making them less susceptible to subsequent coups. This challenges the conventional view of new leaders as inherently weak (Roessler 2011). Despite this distinction, both Sudduth and Roessler acknowledge that new leaders often consolidate power by purging rivals (Sudduth suggests this occurs when there is minimal risk, while Roessler argues it happens when threats are perceived). While the debate on the initial strength of coup leaders continues, both perspectives agree that early purges are more likely.\nSudduth and Bell (2018) investigates how leaders’ entry methods affect their removal in dictatorships. They argue that irregular entry does not necessarily increase the likelihood of removal. In fact, some forms of irregular entry may offer protection. However, their focus was on how leaders lose office, not how long they stay in power. Additionally, they compared six types of irregular leaders without specifically examining the distinction between coup-entry and autocoup leaders.\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts, including universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed challenges, a significant gap remains. There is a lack of research specifically exploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their tenures through autocoups compared to those who come to power through coups d’état. This study aims to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership survival between these two distinct leader types.\n\n\n\n\nCan.Do.So\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders\n\n\n\nArriola, Leonardo R. 2009. “Patronage and Political Stability in Africa.” Comparative Political Studies 42 (10): 1339–62. https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414009332126.\n\n\nBueno de Mesquita, Bruce, Alastair Smith, Randolph M.

    "section": "\n1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoups occur with varying frequency across different countries, with some experiencing them more frequently than others. According to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC)1 dataset (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011), Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between \\(1950\\) and \\(1984\\), while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar time frame. However, Mexico’s authoritarian period from \\(1917\\) to \\(2000\\) saw no coups at all. In Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between \\(1955\\) and \\(2023\\), whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since \\(1950\\). Similar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia.\nThe varying frequency of coup attempts has captivated political scientists for decades, leading to extensive research on the subject. As highlighted by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), despite approximately one hundred potential determinants of coups being suggested, no consensus has been reached. In an effort to address this issue, Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016) tested 66 factors proposed in previous literature using three million model permutations in an extreme bounds analysis.\nExamining previous research, which has tested around 100 variables as potential determinants of coups, raises an important question beyond simply understanding why coups are more frequent in some countries than others. The critical question is: Can we establish a method to help scholars focus on the most relevant factors of coups, rather than sifting through over 100 variables without reaching a consensus?\nReviewing previously proposed variables of coups, it is evident that all focus on pre-coup conditions, with no consideration given to post-coup factors. However, coups are high-stakes gambles with an all-or-nothing nature. As defined by J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011), coups are “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive” (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011, 252). Due to their illegality, the consequences of a failed coup can be severe, with perpetrators risking imprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators. Therefore, no coup plotters would stage a coup without some assurance of success.\nHistorical coup attempts and their success rates provide valuable insights. Despite the significant risks associated with coups since 1950, as shown in Table 2, there have been 491 coups worldwide. Importantly, about half of these coups have been successful. At first glance, coups appear to be a high-success-rate political venture. However, compared to over 12,000 country-years since 1950, the occurrence of 491 coups is relatively rare, accounting for about 4% (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011).\n\nCodecoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt; \n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`, \n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;   \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt; \n  # cols_width(1 ~ px(120),\n  #            2:4 ~ px(88)\n  # ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate clearly indicate that the initiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring depends greatly on its potential success rate. Since coup plotters meticulously assess potential outcomes, we should also analyze what factors most affect these outcomes when discussing the key determinants of coups. This approach allows us to focus on the most relevant factors and disregard those less related.\nWhen considering the factors that most affect the outcomes of coups, the current literature predominantly identifies military power as the decisive factor in the success of coups. This necessitates an analysis of power dynamics within regimes, as military power is ultimately shaped by power dynamics.\nBecause coup attempts are self-selective rather than random, this study employs a double probit model with sample selection to examine factors influencing coup success rates and, consequently, the likelihood of coup attempts. I posit that regime type, by shaping internal power dynamics among coup plotters, incumbents, and other ruling elites, is a crucial determinant of coup likelihood.\nThis study makes two key contributions to the existing literature. First, it underscores the importance of regime type as a crucial determinant of coup attempts. Previous studies often treat regime type as a control variable, overlooking that variations in many other variables are fundamentally rooted in different regime types. More importantly, this study establishes a systematic approach for identifying the most relevant factors, thereby avoiding sifting through over 100 variables.\nThe subsequent sections of this paper explore the dynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. In Part 3, I detail the research design, outlining the methodology and variables used in the analysis. Part 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Finally, Part 5 concludes the study, summarizing the key insights and their implications."

We can categorize coup motivations into three main types:\nPersonal Ambition: The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth is a significant motivator for some coup plotters. For example, Wintrobe (2019) distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on their use of power. While both prioritize personal gain, totalitarian leaders seek complete control over every aspect of society, whereas tinpot leaders focus on enriching themselves through extravagant lifestyles.\nPurported National Interest: Coups are sometimes justified as necessary interventions to save a nation from crisis, uphold the constitution, or facilitate a transition to democracy. While scepticism is warranted due to the potential for self-serving justifications, legitimate cases do exist. For instance, the 2010 coup in Niger ousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term by dissolving the opposing court and calling a self-serving referendum (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019).\nSelf-Preservation: In some instances, coups are pre-emptive strikes against imminent political persecution or repression. Coup leaders might not be motivated by a desire for power, but rather a fear of elimination by the incumbent regime. A notable example is Idi Amin’s 1971 coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his military command position (Sudduth 2017).\nThese motivations can arise in any regime, but autocracies are particularly susceptible, especially for coups framed under the guise of national interest or self-preservation. Stable democracies, on the other hand, rarely face the same level of constitutional crises or political persecution that might necessitate a coup. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and democratic backsliding, creating opportunities for coup plotters to exploit these weaknesses and justify their actions.\nDespite the potential motivations outlined above, coups remain relatively uncommon events, occurring in only about 4% of country-years since 1950. This low frequency highlights the importance of the second key element – capability. Even the most motivated plotters require the resources and opportunities to succeed. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure; the next section will explore the concept of capability in greater detail.\n\n2.2 Capability for coups\nWhile many ambitious individuals may covet supreme power, only a select few possess the capability to orchestrate a successful coup. This capability hinges not just on their desire, but on overcoming inherent disadvantages compared to the incumbent leaders.\nFirstly, coups are inherently clandestine operations due to their illegality. Plotters require a tight-knit group to minimize leaks and maximize the element of surprise. This secrecy restricts their ability to openly recruit supporters, a privilege enjoyed by incumbents who can implement “coup-proofing” measures.\nSecondly, coup plotters face uncertainty about the reactions of other powerful factions within the regime, those who could tip the scales of power. Incumbents, however, have a deeper understanding of these dynamics and proactively work to solidify their own position. While they may not know who exactly might attempt a coup, they are attuned to potential threats and adapt their strategies accordingly.\nThirdly, coup plotters face a significant challenge in securing unwavering loyalty from potential co-conspirators. The risks associated with a coup are substantial, with uncertain rewards even in the event of success. Promises made by coup leaders might not be kept, and post-coup purges are a common tactic to eliminate future coup threats. Defecting to the incumbent leader can often be a safer option, offering predictable rewards and less risk.\nGiven these inherent obstacles, rational coup plotters are unlikely to gamble on a low-probability attempt. They may choose to abandon their plans altogether or bide their time for a more opportune timing. Therefore, when coup plotters do take action, it is because they have meticulously assessed their chances of success and believe the risks are outweighed by the potential gains.\nBut what is the threshold for a “good enough” chance of success? Before diving into a theoretical framework, let’s examine historical data to gain some perspective. Surprisingly, coups since 1950 boast a rather high success rate, with nearly half ending in victory (as shown in Table 2).\n\n2.3 Framework of coup success\nAn oft-cited framework (Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt 2016; Aidt and Leon 2019) provides a structured approach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of coups can be represented by the equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf B\\) represents the return of a successful coup, \\(\\mathbf C\\) signifies the cost of a failed coup, and \\(p\\) represents the probability of coup success. The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B &gt; (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nEquation 2 implies that for Equation 1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from successful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups.\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying \\(\\mathbf B\\) (the value of a successful coup) and \\(\\mathbf C\\) (the cost of failure) is difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after a successful coup, are intangible concepts that defy precise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup in Ghana2, the fate of the coup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high likely to be killed if the coup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds.\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core logic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the return and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive nature of precise values for \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), they can be treated as roughly equal. Consequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and compare these values precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), to the probability of success (\\(p\\)), simplifying Equation 2 to:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np &gt; (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nEquation 3 suggests that, to hold Equation 2 true, a success probability greater than \\(50\\%\\) is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat supports this notion. As shown in Table 2, the overall success rate is \\(49.9\\%\\). While this falls short of the \\(50\\%\\) threshold, it’s important to consider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily reflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly, outliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not prioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can propose our first hypothesis:\n\nH1: The fundamental determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup’s success, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary, the core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the incumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage in this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n2.4 Regime types and power dynamics\nMilitary strength undeniably plays a critical role in coup attempts. Control of the armed forces offers a significant advantage, explaining why military coups dominate discussions on the topic. Much of the literature treats “coup” and “military coup” interchangeably, with scholars like J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011) finding half of 14 studies attribute coups solely to the military. Consequently, significant focus, from both researchers and policymakers, centers on the balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military factions themselves. Strategies like “keeping the military content” (Aidt and Leon 2019) or “providing them with resources” (Huntington 1991) aim to reduce military intervention. Empirical research informs coup-proofing strategies that either decrease the military’s desire for coups or raise barriers to success (Leon 2013; J. Powell et al. 2018).\nHowever, while military power is decisive, previous literature often oversimplifies its nature. As Table 4 will demonstrate, military regimes, despite concentrated military control, exhibit surprising instability. Military regimes experience most frequent coup attempts. This highlights a crucial oversight: the intra-military component. Treating the military as a monolithic entity ignores the complex internal dynamics (Singh 2016). Regardless of size, any military comprises diverse groups with their own hierarchies, fostering suspicion, competition, and vigilance rather than unity. The clandestine nature of coups necessitates small, secretive groups. Plotters are unsure of other factions’ stances and fear their opposition or intervention, as exemplified by the swiftly thwarted 2021 Niger coup3. The success of a coup hinges heavily on other military factions’ reactions (Geddes 1999).\nFurthermore, the relationship between government and military varies across regimes. In democracies, civilian authority reigns supreme. The military is a national institution bound by the constitution, not individual leaders, ensuring political neutrality (e.g., the U.S. Armed Forces). Conversely, non-democracies display a less clear power structure. Identifying the true leader of the military depends on the regime type. We will leverage framework of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) to categorize autocracies based on leadership origin and decision-making. This framework classifies regimes into three main categories: military, personalist, and dominant-party.\nMilitary regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta – a group of military officers who control the regime’s power structure, including leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the Brazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the Salvadoran regime (1948-1984) (Geddes 1999). In personalist regimes, power resides with a single, charismatic leader who controls policy, the military, and succession. Regimes like Rafael Trujillo’s in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin’s in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s in the Central African Republic (1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule (Geddes 1999). In dominant-party regimes, power rests within a well-organized ruling party, with leaders acting as its representatives. The party structure and ideology foster internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Examples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European countries (Geddes 1999).\nThe critical distinction between regime types lies in the unique power balance established during the initial power seizure. The most competent group, be it a military junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically prevails due to the challenges of seizing control. This power grab is often accompanied by purges of potential rivals, solidifying the newly established regime (Sudduth 2017; Roessler 2011).\nFollowing these internal purges and external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges, typically solidifying into one of three main structures: military regimes, personalist regimes, or dominant-party regimes.\n\nDominant-Party Regimes: These regimes boast the greatest stability due to their institutionalized structure. A dominant party, with its shared ideology and goals, fosters internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Power resides within the party, not with any single individual, and the military aligns with the party itself, contributing to greater stability. Formalized succession rules further bolster stability by ensuring a smooth transfer of power (Frantz and Stein 2017).\nPersonalist Regimes: These regimes exhibit a degree of initial stability as dictators, having emerged from intense competition, are typically tough and competent. The purging of rivals creates a temporary status quo within the dictator’s inner circle. However, the lack of a clear succession plan creates a vulnerability. The dictator’s sudden death can plunge the regime into chaos, as potential successors scramble for power, creating a prime opportunity for coups.\nMilitary Regimes: These regimes are often the least stable. Power is typically shared among a junta, leading to mistrust and internal conflicts over benefits and policies. The absence of a single authority figure hinders decisive action, as exemplified by the power struggles within the Chilean junta after the 1973 coup (Arriagada Herrera 1988).\n\n\nCoderead.csv(here(\"data/regimes_comparison.csv\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(institutionalized_leadership_succession = percent(institutionalized_leadership_succession)) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    4 ~ px(180),\n    3 ~ px(80),\n    1:2 ~ px(30)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GWF & Author*\"))\n\n\nTable 3: Main features of different types of regimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCenter of Power\nInstitutionalized Leadership Succession\nPower Transition\n\n\n\nMilitary\nJunta\n59%\nBased on agreement among junta members\n\n\nPersonalist\nDictator\n77%\nDependent on dictator's health or lifepan\n\n\nDominant-party\nParty\n97%\nStructured by the party's institutional frameworks\n\n\n\nSource: GWF & Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese contrasting power dynamics significantly influence a regime’s susceptibility to coups. As Table 4 confirms, military regimes, despite representing only 5.6% of country-years, experience a disproportionate share of coups (over 22%). Personalist regimes follow a similar pattern, facing a higher coup risk (23% of coups) despite constituting only 13% of country-years. Conversely, dominant-party regimes, with their institutionalized structures and unified leadership, exhibit the greatest resilience. They represent 22.6% of country-years but experience a lower incidence of coups (only 16.7%).\n\nCoderegimes &lt;- REIGN |&gt;\n  distinct(reign_cowcode, year, .keep_all = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    regime_type = case_when(\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\n        \"party-based\",\n        \"party-personal\",\n        \"party-military\",\n        \"party-personal-military\",\n        \"oligarchy\"\n      ) ~ \"dominant-party\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"personal\" ~ \"personal\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"military\", \"military personal\", \"indirect military\") ~ \"military\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"monarchy\" ~ \"monarchy\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"presidential\", \"parliamentary\") ~ \"democracy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1949)\n\nregime_total &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime_type) |&gt; \n  arrange(-n) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(country_year =n,\n         share = percent(percent),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n  \n\ncoup1 &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  select(country, ccode, year, coup)\n\ncoup_by_regime &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(num_of_coups = n,\n         percent_of_coups = percent(percent,accuracy = 0.1),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n\ncoup_by_succeed &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup),\n         coup == 2) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  select(regime, succeeded_coup = n) \n\ncoup_regimes &lt;-  coup_by_regime |&gt; \n  left_join(coup_by_succeed) |&gt; \n  mutate(success_rate = percent(succeeded_coup / num_of_coups, accuracy = 0.1))\n\nregime_total |&gt;\n  left_join(coup_regimes, join_by(regime_type == regime)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime_type = str_to_title(regime_type)) |&gt;\n  select(-succeeded_coup) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*\"))\n\n\nTable 4: Regime types and coups since 1950\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCountry Year\nShare\nNum of Coups\nPercent of Coups\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n5303\n46.7%\n122\n24.8%\n51.6%\n\n\nDominant-Party\n2569\n22.6%\n82\n16.7%\n53.7%\n\n\nPersonal\n1477\n13.0%\n113\n23.0%\n44.2%\n\n\nMonarchy\n1056\n9.3%\n25\n5.1%\n56.0%\n\n\nMilitary\n638\n5.6%\n110\n22.4%\n48.2%\n\n\nOther\n322\n2.8%\n39\n7.9%\n53.8%\n\n\nTotal\n11365\n100.0%\n491\n100.0%\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: REIGN and GIC Datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are more prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes are the least likely to experience coups among the three."

    "section": "\n3 Research Design",
    "text": "3 Research Design\n\n3.1 Double probit with sample selection model\nThis study employs a sophisticated statistical approach to account for the selective nature of coup attempts. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes (as discussed previously), success rates tend to be surprisingly consistent, hovering around 50% (as shown in Table 4). This suggests that coup attempts are not random acts, but rather strategically planned and undertaken only when the odds of success appear favourable. A standard statistical model would not account for this selectivity, potentially leading to biased results.\nTo address this issue, we utilize a two-stage sample selection model, similar to the approach used by J. Powell (2012). This model has two parts:\n\nSelection Equation (Stage 1): This stage analyzes the factors influencing whether a coup attempt occurs in a particular regime. The primary explanatory variable here is regime type, as previously discussed. Additional control variables may also be included, denoted by \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\).\nOutcome Equation (Stage 2): This stage focuses on the probability of success for those coup attempts that actually take place.\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are regime types, as previously discussed. Control variables are included in \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\). The selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt occurs and can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1^*=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XA} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nHere, \\({y_1}^*\\) is an unobserved variable, which may be known to coup plotters. \\(Regime_i\\) is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or dominant-party). \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\) captures other control variables, such as the economic crisis index, previous coups, military expenditure, etc.\nThe observed binary outcome \\(\\mathbf{y_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_1^*&gt;0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_1^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the first stage, if \\(y_1^*\\le0\\), no coup attempt occurs in a given country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable does not reach the threshold. If \\(y_1^*&gt;0\\), at least one coup attempt is made in a country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable surpasses the threshold. The probability is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_1 =1)&=Prob(y_{1}^*&gt;0) \\\\\n&=\\Phi(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XA})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nSimilarly, the outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup attempt is successful, given that it occurs:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2^*=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XB} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe observed outcome \\(y_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_2^*&gt;0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_2^*\\le0$ (coup fails)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe probability equations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_2=1|y_1 =1)=\\Phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XB})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7}\\]\n\n3.2 Variables\n\n3.2.1 Dependent variable\nOur analysis utilizes data on coup attempts and outcomes from J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011). A successful coup is defined as one where the incumbent leader is removed from power for more than seven days. The dataset covers the period from 1950 to 2023 and includes information on 491 coup attempts, with roughly half (245) being successful. Descriptive statistics for these coup attempts and regime types can be found in Table 2 and Table 4.\n\n3.2.2 Key Independent Variable: Regime Type\nThe core variable of interest is regime type, categorized following the classification system of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF). We focus on military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included for comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in Table 4.\n\n3.2.3 Control variables\nOur control variables are chosen based on the research of Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016). They analyzed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic growth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are particularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance, political violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control variables.\nEconomic Performance: We measure economic performance using the current-trend (\\(CT\\)) ratio developed by Krishnarajan (2019). This ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher \\(CT\\) ratio indicates stronger economic performance. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022), lagged by one year to reflect the prior year’s economic impact. For a country \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\), the \\(CT\\) ratio is calculated as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPolitical Violence: We capture overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. This data comes from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall (Marshall 2005).\nPrevious coups: The number of previous coups in a country is included in the first-stage (selection) model to assess its influence on the likelihood of a coup attempt. However, it is excluded from the second-stage model (outcome) because the number of past coups may not directly impact the outcome of a specific coup attempt."

    "text": "4 Results and Discussion\n\n4.1 Interpretation and Discussion\nThe double probit model with sample selection, estimated using the sampleSelection package in R, offers valuable insights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types (Table \\(\\ref{results}\\)).\nAs expected, military and personalist regimes are significantly more likely to experience coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes (all coefficients positive and significant at the 1% level). This aligns with our theoretical expectations regarding the internal power struggles within military juntas and the vulnerability of personalist regimes during succession crises. These findings highlight the importance of regime structure in understanding coup likelihood.\nThe control variables show the expected effects. Stronger economic performance (higher economic trend and GDP per capita) is associated with a lower risk of coups. Interestingly, the number of previous coups has a negative coefficient, suggesting a possible deterrent effect. However, this finding is not substantially significant. Overall, even after considering these factors, regime type remains a significant determinant of coup attempts, underscoring the robustness of the model.\nMost coefficients in the coup outcome equation are not statistically significant. This supports the hypothesis that coup attempts are strategically planned and undertaken only when the perceived chance of success is high. The selection process (whether a coup attempt occurs) seems to play a more critical role than these variables in determining the outcome. The negative and significant coefficient for GDP per capita suggests that stronger economies may bolster support for incumbents, making successful coups less likely.\nThe correlation coefficient (\\(\\rho\\)) between the error terms is positive (0.709) but not statistically significant (p-value = 0.445). While a positive correlation might suggest that factors increasing coup attempts also increasing their success, the lack of statistical significance weakens this connection. This finding implies that selection bias, while present, may not be as strong as initially anticipated.\nThe results strongly support the choice of the sample selection model. Significant coefficients with theoretically consistent directions suggest the model effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. Regime types with weaker institutional structures are more vulnerable to coup attempts, while better economic conditions make coups less likely overall. The model effectively addresses the non-random nature of coup attempts by treating selection and outcome as separate processes.\nThe observed disparity between coup attempt rates and success rates across regimes points towards selection bias, further validating the use of the sample selection model. This model acknowledges that coups are not random events, but rather strategic actions undertaken when the odds appear favourable.\nTo summary, the double probit model with sample selection proves to be a well-suited approach for this research. It provides robust insights into the factors influencing both the likelihood of coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types. The findings highlight the crucial role of regime structure and the selective nature of coup attempts, supporting the theoretical framework and empirical strategy employed in this study."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\nMotivated by the lack of consensus despite numerous empirical studies on the determinants of coups, this study introduces a novel approach that prioritizes determinants based on their impact on coup success. By analysing coup success rates, the study hypothesizes that the expected outcomes of coups are critical determinants of their occurrence. Utilizing a double probit model with sample selection, I investigate and confirm the relationship between regime types and coup attempts.\nThe findings suggest that regime type plays a significant role in the likelihood of coup attempts. Military and personalist regimes, characterized by weaker institutional frameworks and higher vulnerability during power transitions, are more susceptible to coups. This underscores the importance of supporting initiatives that strengthen constitutional institutions within these regimes.\nThe research also finds that stronger economic performance is associated with a lower risk of coups, suggesting that policies promoting economic development can be effective in reducing coup risk.\nThe study shows that the most efficient coup-proofing strategies involve the establishment of strong institutions. In contrast, purges, random shifting of military officers, or increased military expenditures are less effective. However, few autocratic leaders, particularly dictators or military juntas, are willing to institutionalize their regimes, as such reforms may constrain their power or shorten their terms. While institutions benefit the regime, they do not necessarily benefit the leaders themselves.\nFuture research could explore specific institutional reforms that are most effective in improving stability across different regimes."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoups occur with varying frequency across different countries, with some experiencing them more frequently than others. According to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC)1 dataset (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011), Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between \\(1950\\) and \\(1984\\), while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar time frame. However, Mexico’s authoritarian period from \\(1917\\) to \\(2000\\) saw no coups at all. In Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between \\(1955\\) and \\(2023\\), whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since \\(1950\\). Similar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia.\nThe varying frequency of coup attempts has captivated political scientists for decades, leading to extensive research on the subject. As highlighted by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), despite approximately one hundred potential determinants of coups being suggested, no consensus has been reached. In an effort to address this issue, Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016) tested 66 factors proposed in previous literature using three million model permutations in an extreme bounds analysis.\nExamining previous research, which has tested around 100 variables as potential determinants of coups, raises an important question beyond simply understanding why coups are more frequent in some countries than others. The critical question is: Can we establish a method to help scholars focus on the most relevant factors of coups, rather than sifting through over 100 variables without reaching a consensus?\nReviewing previously proposed variables of coups, it is evident that all focus on pre-coup conditions, with no consideration given to post-coup factors. However, coups are high-stakes gambles with an all-or-nothing nature. As defined by J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011), coups are “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive” (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011, 252). Due to their illegality, the consequences of a failed coup can be severe, with perpetrators risking imprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators. Therefore, no coup plotters would stage a coup without some assurance of success.\nHistorical coup attempts and their success rates provide valuable insights. Despite the significant risks associated with coups since 1950, as shown in Table 2, there have been 491 coups worldwide. Importantly, about half of these coups have been successful. At first glance, coups appear to be a high-success-rate political venture. However, compared to over 12,000 country-years since 1950, the occurrence of 491 coups is relatively rare, accounting for about 4% (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011).\n\nCodecoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt; \n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`, \n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;   \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt; \n  # cols_width(1 ~ px(120),\n  #            2:4 ~ px(88)\n  # ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate clearly indicate that the initiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring depends greatly on its potential success rate. Since coup plotters meticulously assess potential outcomes, we should also analyze what factors most affect these outcomes when discussing the key determinants of coups. This approach allows us to focus on the most relevant factors and disregard those less related.\nWhen considering the factors that most affect the outcomes of coups, the current literature predominantly identifies military power as the decisive factor in the success of coups. This necessitates an analysis of power dynamics within regimes, as military power is ultimately shaped by power dynamics.\nBecause coup attempts are self-selective rather than random, this study employs a double probit model with sample selection to examine factors influencing coup success rates and, consequently, the likelihood of coup attempts. I posit that regime type, by shaping internal power dynamics among coup plotters, incumbents, and other ruling elites, is a crucial determinant of coup likelihood.\nThis study makes two key contributions to the existing literature. First, it underscores the importance of regime type as a crucial determinant of coup attempts. Previous studies often treat regime type as a control variable, overlooking that variations in many other variables are fundamentally rooted in different regime types. More importantly, this study establishes a systematic approach for identifying the most relevant factors, thereby avoiding sifting through over 100 variables.\nThe subsequent sections of this paper explore the dynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. In Part 3, I detail the research design, outlining the methodology and variables used in the analysis. Part 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Finally, Part 5 concludes the study, summarizing the key insights and their implications.\nhttps://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/home.htm, accessed on 2024-06-05"

    "section": "\n2 Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes",
    "text": "2 Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\nCoup attempts are driven by a complex interplay of factors, with two key elements attracting significant scholarly attention: disposition (the motivations behind the attempt) and capability (the resources and opportunities to succeed).\n\n2.1 Motivations for coups\nThis section focuses on disposition, exploring the primary motivations that compel individuals to undertake the significant risks associated with a coup. We can categorize coup motivations into three main types:\nPersonal Ambition: The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth is a significant motivator for some coup plotters. For example, Wintrobe (2019) distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on their use of power. While both prioritize personal gain, totalitarian leaders seek complete control over every aspect of society, whereas tinpot leaders focus on enriching themselves through extravagant lifestyles.\nPurported National Interest: Coups are sometimes justified as necessary interventions to save a nation from crisis, uphold the constitution, or facilitate a transition to democracy. While scepticism is warranted due to the potential for self-serving justifications, legitimate cases do exist. For instance, the 2010 coup in Niger ousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term by dissolving the opposing court and calling a self-serving referendum (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019).\nSelf-Preservation: In some instances, coups are pre-emptive strikes against imminent political persecution or repression. Coup leaders might not be motivated by a desire for power, but rather a fear of elimination by the incumbent regime. A notable example is Idi Amin’s 1971 coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his military command position (Sudduth 2017).\nThese motivations can arise in any regime, but autocracies are particularly susceptible, especially for coups framed under the guise of national interest or self-preservation. Stable democracies, on the other hand, rarely face the same level of constitutional crises or political persecution that might necessitate a coup. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and democratic backsliding, creating opportunities for coup plotters to exploit these weaknesses and justify their actions.\nDespite the potential motivations outlined above, coups remain relatively uncommon events, occurring in only about 4% of country-years since 1950. This low frequency highlights the importance of the second key element – capability. Even the most motivated plotters require the resources and opportunities to succeed. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure; the next section will explore the concept of capability in greater detail.\n\n2.2 Capability for coups\nWhile many ambitious individuals may covet supreme power, only a select few possess the capability to orchestrate a successful coup. This capability hinges not just on their desire, but on overcoming inherent disadvantages compared to the incumbent leaders.\nFirstly, coups are inherently clandestine operations due to their illegality. Plotters require a tight-knit group to minimize leaks and maximize the element of surprise. This secrecy restricts their ability to openly recruit supporters, a privilege enjoyed by incumbents who can implement “coup-proofing” measures.\nSecondly, coup plotters face uncertainty about the reactions of other powerful factions within the regime, those who could tip the scales of power. Incumbents, however, have a deeper understanding of these dynamics and proactively work to solidify their own position. While they may not know who exactly might attempt a coup, they are attuned to potential threats and adapt their strategies accordingly.\nThirdly, coup plotters face a significant challenge in securing unwavering loyalty from potential co-conspirators. The risks associated with a coup are substantial, with uncertain rewards even in the event of success. Promises made by coup leaders might not be kept, and post-coup purges are a common tactic to eliminate future coup threats. Defecting to the incumbent leader can often be a safer option, offering predictable rewards and less risk.\nGiven these inherent obstacles, rational coup plotters are unlikely to gamble on a low-probability attempt. They may choose to abandon their plans altogether or bide their time for a more opportune timing. Therefore, when coup plotters do take action, it is because they have meticulously assessed their chances of success and believe the risks are outweighed by the potential gains.\nBut what is the threshold for a “good enough” chance of success? Before diving into a theoretical framework, let’s examine historical data to gain some perspective. Surprisingly, coups since 1950 boast a rather high success rate, with nearly half ending in victory (as shown in Table 2).\n\n2.3 Framework of coup success\nAn oft-cited framework (Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt 2016; Aidt and Leon 2019) provides a structured approach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of coups can be represented by the equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(1)\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf B\\) represents the return of a successful coup, \\(\\mathbf C\\) signifies the cost of a failed coup, and \\(p\\) represents the probability of coup success. The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B &gt; (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(2)\\]\nEquation 2 implies that for Equation 1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from successful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups.\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying \\(\\mathbf B\\) (the value of a successful coup) and \\(\\mathbf C\\) (the cost of failure) is difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after a successful coup, are intangible concepts that defy precise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup in Ghana1, the fate of the coup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high likely to be killed if the coup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds.\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core logic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the return and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive nature of precise values for \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), they can be treated as roughly equal. Consequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and compare these values precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), to the probability of success (\\(p\\)), simplifying Equation 2 to:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np &gt; (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(3)\\]\nEquation 3 suggests that, to hold Equation 2 true, a success probability greater than \\(50\\%\\) is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat supports this notion. As shown in Table 2, the overall success rate is \\(49.9\\%\\). While this falls short of the \\(50\\%\\) threshold, it’s important to consider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily reflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly, outliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not prioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can propose our first hypothesis:\n\nH1: The fundamental determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup’s success, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary, the core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the incumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage in this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n2.4 Regime types and power dynamics\nMilitary strength undeniably plays a critical role in coup attempts. Control of the armed forces offers a significant advantage, explaining why military coups dominate discussions on the topic. Much of the literature treats “coup” and “military coup” interchangeably, with scholars like J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011) finding half of 14 studies attribute coups solely to the military. Consequently, significant focus, from both researchers and policymakers, centers on the balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military factions themselves. Strategies like “keeping the military content” (Aidt and Leon 2019) or “providing them with resources” (Huntington 1991) aim to reduce military intervention. Empirical research informs coup-proofing strategies that either decrease the military’s desire for coups or raise barriers to success (Leon 2013; J. Powell et al. 2018).\nHowever, while military power is decisive, previous literature often oversimplifies its nature. As Table 4 will demonstrate, military regimes, despite concentrated military control, exhibit surprising instability. Military regimes experience most frequent coup attempts. This highlights a crucial oversight: the intra-military component. Treating the military as a monolithic entity ignores the complex internal dynamics (Singh 2016). Regardless of size, any military comprises diverse groups with their own hierarchies, fostering suspicion, competition, and vigilance rather than unity. The clandestine nature of coups necessitates small, secretive groups. Plotters are unsure of other factions’ stances and fear their opposition or intervention, as exemplified by the swiftly thwarted 2021 Niger coup2. The success of a coup hinges heavily on other military factions’ reactions (Geddes 1999).\nFurthermore, the relationship between government and military varies across regimes. In democracies, civilian authority reigns supreme. The military is a national institution bound by the constitution, not individual leaders, ensuring political neutrality (e.g., the U.S. Armed Forces). Conversely, non-democracies display a less clear power structure. Identifying the true leader of the military depends on the regime type. We will leverage framework of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) to categorize autocracies based on leadership origin and decision-making. This framework classifies regimes into three main categories: military, personalist, and dominant-party.\nMilitary regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta – a group of military officers who control the regime’s power structure, including leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the Brazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the Salvadoran regime (1948-1984) (Geddes 1999). In personalist regimes, power resides with a single, charismatic leader who controls policy, the military, and succession. Regimes like Rafael Trujillo’s in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin’s in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s in the Central African Republic (1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule (Geddes 1999). In dominant-party regimes, power rests within a well-organized ruling party, with leaders acting as its representatives. The party structure and ideology foster internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Examples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European countries (Geddes 1999).\nThe critical distinction between regime types lies in the unique power balance established during the initial power seizure. The most competent group, be it a military junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically prevails due to the challenges of seizing control. This power grab is often accompanied by purges of potential rivals, solidifying the newly established regime (Sudduth 2017; Roessler 2011).\nFollowing these internal purges and external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges, typically solidifying into one of three main structures: military regimes, personalist regimes, or dominant-party regimes.\n\nDominant-Party Regimes: These regimes boast the greatest stability due to their institutionalized structure. A dominant party, with its shared ideology and goals, fosters internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Power resides within the party, not with any single individual, and the military aligns with the party itself, contributing to greater stability. Formalized succession rules further bolster stability by ensuring a smooth transfer of power (Frantz and Stein 2017).\nPersonalist Regimes: These regimes exhibit a degree of initial stability as dictators, having emerged from intense competition, are typically tough and competent. The purging of rivals creates a temporary status quo within the dictator’s inner circle. However, the lack of a clear succession plan creates a vulnerability. The dictator’s sudden death can plunge the regime into chaos, as potential successors scramble for power, creating a prime opportunity for coups.\nMilitary Regimes: These regimes are often the least stable. Power is typically shared among a junta, leading to mistrust and internal conflicts over benefits and policies. The absence of a single authority figure hinders decisive action, as exemplified by the power struggles within the Chilean junta after the 1973 coup (Arriagada Herrera 1988).\n\n\nCoderead.csv(here(\"data/regimes_comparison.csv\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(institutionalized_leadership_succession = percent(institutionalized_leadership_succession)) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    4 ~ px(180),\n    3 ~ px(80),\n    1:2 ~ px(30)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GWF & Author*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Main features of different types of regimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCenter of Power\nInstitutionalized Leadership Succession\nPower Transition\n\n\n\nMilitary\nJunta\n59%\nBased on agreement among junta members\n\n\nPersonalist\nDictator\n77%\nDependent on dictator's health or lifepan\n\n\nDominant-party\nParty\n97%\nStructured by the party's institutional frameworks\n\n\n\nSource: GWF & Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese contrasting power dynamics significantly influence a regime’s susceptibility to coups. As Table 4 confirms, military regimes, despite representing only 5.6% of country-years, experience a disproportionate share of coups (over 22%). Personalist regimes follow a similar pattern, facing a higher coup risk (23% of coups) despite constituting only 13% of country-years. Conversely, dominant-party regimes, with their institutionalized structures and unified leadership, exhibit the greatest resilience. They represent 22.6% of country-years but experience a lower incidence of coups (only 16.7%).\n\nCoderegimes &lt;- REIGN |&gt;\n  distinct(reign_cowcode, year, .keep_all = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    regime_type = case_when(\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\n        \"party-based\",\n        \"party-personal\",\n        \"party-military\",\n        \"party-personal-military\",\n        \"oligarchy\"\n      ) ~ \"dominant-party\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"personal\" ~ \"personal\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"military\", \"military personal\", \"indirect military\") ~ \"military\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"monarchy\" ~ \"monarchy\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"presidential\", \"parliamentary\") ~ \"democracy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1949)\n\nregime_total &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime_type) |&gt; \n  arrange(-n) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(country_year =n,\n         share = percent(percent),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n  \n\ncoup1 &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  select(country, ccode, year, coup)\n\ncoup_by_regime &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(num_of_coups = n,\n         percent_of_coups = percent(percent,accuracy = 0.1),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n\ncoup_by_succeed &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup),\n         coup == 2) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  select(regime, succeeded_coup = n) \n\ncoup_regimes &lt;-  coup_by_regime |&gt; \n  left_join(coup_by_succeed) |&gt; \n  mutate(success_rate = percent(succeeded_coup / num_of_coups, accuracy = 0.1))\n\nregime_total |&gt;\n  left_join(coup_regimes, join_by(regime_type == regime)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime_type = str_to_title(regime_type)) |&gt;\n  select(-succeeded_coup) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Regime types and coups since 1950\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCountry Year\nShare\nNum of Coups\nPercent of Coups\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n5303\n46.7%\n122\n24.8%\n51.6%\n\n\nDominant-Party\n2569\n22.6%\n82\n16.7%\n53.7%\n\n\nPersonal\n1477\n13.0%\n113\n23.0%\n44.2%\n\n\nMonarchy\n1056\n9.3%\n25\n5.1%\n56.0%\n\n\nMilitary\n638\n5.6%\n110\n22.4%\n48.2%\n\n\nOther\n322\n2.8%\n39\n7.9%\n53.8%\n\n\nTotal\n11365\n100.0%\n491\n100.0%\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: REIGN and GIC Datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are more prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes are the least likely to experience coups among the three.\n\nIn the case of the Ghanaian coup, flight lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings narrowly avoided execution after his initial failure, being freed by mutinous soldiers.

    "text": "3 Research Design\n\n3.1 Double probit with sample selection model\nThis study employs a sophisticated statistical approach to account for the selective nature of coup attempts. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes (as discussed previously), success rates tend to be surprisingly consistent, hovering around 50% (as shown in Table 4). This suggests that coup attempts are not random acts, but rather strategically planned and undertaken only when the odds of success appear favourable. A standard statistical model would not account for this selectivity, potentially leading to biased results.\nTo address this issue, we utilize a two-stage sample selection model, similar to the approach used by J. Powell (2012). This model has two parts:\n\nSelection Equation (Stage 1): This stage analyzes the factors influencing whether a coup attempt occurs in a particular regime. The primary explanatory variable here is regime type, as previously discussed. Additional control variables may also be included, denoted by \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\).\nOutcome Equation (Stage 2): This stage focuses on the probability of success for those coup attempts that actually take place.\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are regime types, as previously discussed. Control variables are included in \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\). The selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt occurs and can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1^*=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XA} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(4)\\]\nHere, \\({y_1}^*\\) is an unobserved variable, which may be known to coup plotters. \\(Regime_i\\) is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or dominant-party). \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\) captures other control variables, such as the economic crisis index, previous coups, military expenditure, etc.\nThe observed binary outcome \\(\\mathbf{y_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_1^*&gt;0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_1^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the first stage, if \\(y_1^*\\le0\\), no coup attempt occurs in a given country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable does not reach the threshold. If \\(y_1^*&gt;0\\), at least one coup attempt is made in a country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable surpasses the threshold. The probability is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_1 =1)&=Prob(y_{1}^*&gt;0) \\\\\n&=\\Phi(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XA})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(5)\\]\nSimilarly, the outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup attempt is successful, given that it occurs:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2^*=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XB} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(6)\\]\nThe observed outcome \\(y_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_2^*&gt;0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_2^*\\le0$ (coup fails)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe probability equations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_2=1|y_1 =1)=\\Phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XB})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(7)\\]\n\n3.2 Variables\n\n3.2.1 Dependent variable\nOur analysis utilizes data on coup attempts and outcomes from J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011). A successful coup is defined as one where the incumbent leader is removed from power for more than seven days. The dataset covers the period from 1950 to 2023 and includes information on 491 coup attempts, with roughly half (245) being successful. Descriptive statistics for these coup attempts and regime types can be found in Table 2 and Table 4.\n\n3.2.2 Key Independent Variable: Regime Type\nThe core variable of interest is regime type, categorized following the classification system of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF). We focus on military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included for comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in Table 4.\n\n3.2.3 Control variables\nOur control variables are chosen based on the research of Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016). They analyzed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic growth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are particularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance, political violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control variables.\nEconomic Performance: We measure economic performance using the current-trend (\\(CT\\)) ratio developed by Krishnarajan (2019). This ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher \\(CT\\) ratio indicates stronger economic performance. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022), lagged by one year to reflect the prior year’s economic impact. For a country \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\), the \\(CT\\) ratio is calculated as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPolitical Violence: We capture overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. This data comes from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall (Marshall 2005).\nPrevious coups: The number of previous coups in a country is included in the first-stage (selection) model to assess its influence on the likelihood of a coup attempt. However, it is excluded from the second-stage model (outcome) because the number of past coups may not directly impact the outcome of a specific coup attempt."

    "text": "4 Results and Discussion\n\n4.1 Interpretation and Discussion\nThe double probit model with sample selection, estimated using the sampleSelection package in R, offers valuable insights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types (Table \\(\\ref{results}\\)).\nAs expected, military and personalist regimes are significantly more likely to experience coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes (all coefficients positive and significant at the 1% level). This aligns with our theoretical expectations regarding the internal power struggles within military juntas and the vulnerability of personalist regimes during succession crises. These findings highlight the importance of regime structure in understanding coup likelihood.\nThe control variables show the expected effects. Stronger economic performance (higher economic trend and GDP per capita) is associated with a lower risk of coups. Interestingly, the number of previous coups has a negative coefficient, suggesting a possible deterrent effect. However, this finding is not substantially significant. Overall, even after considering these factors, regime type remains a significant determinant of coup attempts, underscoring the robustness of the model.\nMost coefficients in the coup outcome equation are not statistically significant. This supports the hypothesis that coup attempts are strategically planned and undertaken only when the perceived chance of success is high. The selection process (whether a coup attempt occurs) seems to play a more critical role than these variables in determining the outcome. The negative and significant coefficient for GDP per capita suggests that stronger economies may bolster support for incumbents, making successful coups less likely.\nThe correlation coefficient (\\(\\rho\\)) between the error terms is positive (0.709) but not statistically significant (p-value = 0.445). While a positive correlation might suggest that factors increasing coup attempts also increasing their success, the lack of statistical significance weakens this connection. This finding implies that selection bias, while present, may not be as strong as initially anticipated.\nThe results strongly support the choice of the sample selection model. Significant coefficients with theoretically consistent directions suggest the model effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. Regime types with weaker institutional structures are more vulnerable to coup attempts, while better economic conditions make coups less likely overall. The model effectively addresses the non-random nature of coup attempts by treating selection and outcome as separate processes.\nThe observed disparity between coup attempt rates and success rates across regimes points towards selection bias, further validating the use of the sample selection model. This model acknowledges that coups are not random events, but rather strategic actions undertaken when the odds appear favourable.\nTo summary, the double probit model with sample selection proves to be a well-suited approach for this research. It provides robust insights into the factors influencing both the likelihood of coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types. The findings highlight the crucial role of regime structure and the selective nature of coup attempts, supporting the theoretical framework and empirical strategy employed in this study."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\nMotivated by the lack of consensus despite numerous empirical studies on the determinants of coups, this study introduces a novel approach that prioritizes determinants based on their impact on coup success. By analysing coup success rates, the study hypothesizes that the expected outcomes of coups are critical determinants of their occurrence. Utilizing a double probit model with sample selection, I investigate and confirm the relationship between regime types and coup attempts.\nThe findings suggest that regime type plays a significant role in the likelihood of coup attempts. Military and personalist regimes, characterized by weaker institutional frameworks and higher vulnerability during power transitions, are more susceptible to coups. This underscores the importance of supporting initiatives that strengthen constitutional institutions within these regimes.\nThe research also finds that stronger economic performance is associated with a lower risk of coups, suggesting that policies promoting economic development can be effective in reducing coup risk.\nThe study shows that the most efficient coup-proofing strategies involve the establishment of strong institutions. In contrast, purges, random shifting of military officers, or increased military expenditures are less effective. However, few autocratic leaders, particularly dictators or military juntas, are willing to institutionalize their regimes, as such reforms may constrain their power or shorten their terms. While institutions benefit the regime, they do not necessarily benefit the leaders themselves.\nFuture research could explore specific institutional reforms that are most effective in improving stability across different regimes.\n\n\n\n\nCan.Do.So\n\n\n\n\nAidt, Toke, and Gabriel Leon. 2019. “The Coup.” Edited by Roger D.

    "text": "4 Reading the data as a Partquet file\nThanks to arrow, this code will work regardless of how large the underlying dataset is. But it’s currently rather slow: on mycomputer, it took 20 seconds or longer to run. That’s not terrible given how much data we have, but we can make it much faster by switching to a better format.\n\n4.1 Rewriting the Seattle library data as a Parquet file\n```{r}\nseattle_csv |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear) |&gt;\n  write_dataset(path = \"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", format = \"parquet\")\n```\nIt took about 30 seconds to write the dataset as a Parquet file, which is 4,42 GB in size, less than half the size of the original CSV file. Let’s take a look at what we just produced:\n\nCodetibble(\n  files = list.files(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", recursive = TRUE),\n  size_MB = file.size(file.path(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", files)) / 1024^2\n)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOur single 9GB CSV file has been rewritten into 18 parquet files. The file names use a “self-describing” convention used by the Apache Hive project. Hive-style partitions name folders with a “key=value” convention, so as you might guess, the CheckoutYear=2005 directory contains all the data where CheckoutYear is 2005. Each file is between 100 and 300 MB and the total size is now around 4 GB, a little over half the size of the original CSV file. This is as we expect since parquet is a much more efficient format.\n\n4.2 Using dplyr with arrow\nNow we’ve created these parquet files, we’ll need to read them in again. We use open_dataset() again, but this time we give it a directory:\n\nCodeseattle_pq &lt;- open_dataset(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\")\n\n\nNow we can write our dplyr pipeline. For example, we could count the total number of books checked out in each month for the last five years:\n\nCodequery &lt;- seattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear &gt;= 2018, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth)\n\n\nWriting dplyr code for arrow data is conceptually similar to dbplyr, Chapter 21: you write dplyr code, which is automatically transformed into a query that the Apache Arrow C++ library understands, which is then executed when you call collect(). If we print out the query object we can see a little information about what we expect Arrow to return when the execution takes place. And we can get the results by calling collect():\n\nCodequery\n\nFileSystemDataset (query)\nCheckoutYear: int32\nCheckoutMonth: int64\nTotalCheckouts: int64\n\n* Grouped by CheckoutYear\n* Sorted by CheckoutYear [asc], CheckoutMonth [asc]\nSee $.data for the source Arrow object\n\nCodequery |&gt; \n  collect()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLet’s compare the time it took to count the Checkouts by year using the CSV file and the Parquet file and see if it worth the trouble.\n\nCodecsvtime &lt;- seattle_csv |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\ncsvtime\n\n   user  system elapsed \n 20.009   3.322  20.048 \n\n\n\nCodepqtime &lt;- seattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\npqtime\n\n   user  system elapsed \n  0.449   0.071   0.131 \n\n\nParquet file took 0.131 seconds while csv file took 20.048 seconds. The Parquet file is extremely faster, about 100 times, than the CSV file. Totally worth the trouble."

    "text": "Setting up a dataset for this cheatsheet allows me to spotlight two recent R packages created by Hadley Wickham. The first, dplyr, is a set of new tools for data manipulation. Using dplyr, I will extract flights and weather data from another new package called nycflights13. With this data I will show how to estimate a couple of regression models and nicely format the results into tables with stargazer.\nNote: stargazer v. 5.1 does not play nicely with dplyr’s tbl_df class. As a temporary work-around I pipe the merged dataset to data.frame.\n\nCodelibrary(\"dplyr\")\nlibrary(\"nycflights13\")\nlibrary(\"AER\") # Applied Econometrics with R\nlibrary(\"stargazer\")\n\ndaily &lt;- flights %&gt;%\n  filter(origin == \"EWR\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, month, day) %&gt;%\n  summarise(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ndaily_weather &lt;- weather %&gt;%\n  filter(origin == \"EWR\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, month, day) %&gt;%\n  summarise(temp   = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),\n            wind   = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE),\n            precip = sum(precip, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Merge flights with weather data frames\nboth &lt;- inner_join(daily, daily_weather) %&gt;% \n  data.frame()  # Temporary fix\n\n# Create an indicator for quarter\nboth$quarter &lt;- cut(both$month, breaks = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12), \n                                labels = c(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\"))\n\n# Create a vector of class logical\nboth$hot &lt;- as.logical(both$temp &gt; 85)\n\nhead(both)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nWe can use the both data frame to estimate a couple of linear models predicting the average delay out of Newark controlling for the weather. The first model will use only the weather variables and in the second I’ll add dummy variables indicating the quarter. I also estimate a third model, using using the ivreg command from package AER to demonstrate output with mixed models.

If you desire LaTeX output, just remove the type option from the code below.\n\nAlso, while I have added an example for many of the available stargazer options, I have not included all of them. So while you’re likely to find a relevant example don’t assume if it’s not listed that stargazer can’t do it. Check the documentation for additional features and updates to the package. It is often the case that an omitted argument is specific for LaTeX output and I can’t demonstrate it here.\n\n2.1 HTML formatting\nIt is possible to change the formatting of html tables generated with stargazer via an html style sheet.

For this example I will display the same model twice and adjust the standard errors in the second column with the HC1 correction from the sandwich package (i.e. the same correction Stata uses).\nI also need to adjust the F statistic with the corrected variance-covariance matrix (matching Stata’s results). Currently, this must be done manually (via add.lines) as stargazer does not (yet) have an option for directly replacing the F statistic.\nSimilar options exist to supply adjusted values to the coefficients, t-statistics, confidence intervals, and p-values. See coef, t, ci.custom, or p.\nCodelibrary(sandwich)\nlibrary(lmtest)   # waldtest; see also coeftest.\n\n# Adjust standard errors\ncov1         &lt;- vcovHC(output, type = \"HC1\")\nrobust_se    &lt;- sqrt(diag(cov1))\n\n# Adjust F statistic \nwald_results &lt;- waldtest(output, vcov = cov1)\n\nstargazer(output, output, type = \"html\",\n          se        = list(NULL, robust_se),\n          omit.stat = \"f\",\n          add.lines = list(c(\"F Statistic (df = 3; 360)\", \"12.879***\", \"7.73***\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndelay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntemp\n\n\n0.079**\n\n\n0.079*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.039)\n\n\n(0.041)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwind\n\n\n0.285*\n\n\n0.285\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.157)\n\n\n(0.177)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprecip\n\n\n15.255***\n\n\n15.255***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.013)\n\n\n(4.827)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n6.152**\n\n\n6.152**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.989)\n\n\n(3.074)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF Statistic (df = 3; 360)\n\n\n12.879***\n\n\n7.73***\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n364\n\n\n364\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.154\n\n\n0.154\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.147\n\n\n0.147\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.
