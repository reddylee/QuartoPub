You might ask. The answer is that duckdb is faster than R for large datasets. As showed above, the query in duckdb is much faster than in R to get the same results.\nWe might not notice a significant difference in query execution speed in this example because the dataset is small. However, the discrepancy becomes more apparent with larger datasets. Let’s examine a big dataset to observe the contrast in query execution speed. We’ll use a dataset containing item checkouts from Seattle public libraries, accessible online at Seattle.\nWhen attempting to read the dataset with read_csv(), it may encounter considerable processing delays or even fail outright. This is primarily due to the dataset’s substantial size, comprising approximately 41,389,465 rows, spanning 12 columns, and occupying 9.21 GB of storage space. The following code would fail to read such voluminous data.\n```{r}\nread_csv(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv\") |&gt; \n  nrow()\n```\nLet’s try to query with duckdb.\n\nCodetic(\"sql\")\n\n\n\nCodeSelect Count(*)\nFrom read_csv('~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv')\n\n\n1 records\n\ncount_star()\n\n\n41389465\n\n\n\n\n\nCodetoc()\n\nsql: 6.207 sec elapsed\n\n\nDuckDB took a bit longer to retrieve the results, more than 4 seconds, but the performance was quite acceptable. It outperformed R, which failed to read the data altogether."

Patients were determined to be at high risk on the basis of validated patient- and procedure-related risk factors. The primary outcome was post-ERCP pancreatitis, which was defined as new upper abdominal pain, an elevation in pancreatic enzymes to at least three times the upper limit of the normal range 24 hours after the procedure, and hospitalization for at least 2 nights.\nRESULTS A total of 602 patients were enrolled and completed follow-up. The majority of patients (82%) had a clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Post-ERCP pancreatitis developed in 27 of 295 patients (9.2%) in the indomethacin group and in 52 of 307 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.005). Moderate-to-severe pancreatitis developed in 13 patients (4.4%) in the indomethacin group and in 27 patients (8.8%) in the placebo group (P=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, rectal indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of the condition.

    "section": "\n1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoups occur with varying frequency across different countries, with some experiencing them more frequently than others. According to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC)1 dataset (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011), Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between \\(1950\\) and \\(1984\\), while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar time frame. However, Mexico’s authoritarian period from \\(1917\\) to \\(2000\\) saw no coups at all. In Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between \\(1955\\) and \\(2023\\), whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since \\(1950\\). Similar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia. The question of why coups occur more frequently in certain regions, countries, and periods, while being less common in others, has captivated scholars for decades. Consequently, scholars have delved into extensive research on coups. Despite numerous efforts in past studies to shed light on these disparities, a definitive model or set of determinants for analysing coups remains elusive. As highlighted by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), although approximately one hundred potential determinants of coups have been suggested, the fundamental question remains unanswered.\nHowever, despite extensive research by scholars, the impact of anticipated outcomes on coup initiation has not received sufficient attention. When analysing the determinants of coups, it is crucial not to overlook the most significant characteristic of coups themselves. As defined by J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011), coups are “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.”(J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011, 252). Due to their illegality, the consequences of a failed coup could be severe, with perpetrators risking imprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, the repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators.\nDespite the significant risks associated with coups, as shown in Table 2 since \\(1950\\), there have still been as many as 491 coups worldwide. Furthermore, more importantly, half of these coups have been successful. At first glance, coups seem to be a high-success-rate, high-reward political venture and speculation. However, compared to over \\(12,000\\) country-years since \\(1950\\), the occurrence of 491 coups appears rather rare, accounting for less than \\(4\\%\\) (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011).\n\nCodecoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt; \n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`, \n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;   \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt; \n  # cols_width(1 ~ px(120),\n  #            2:4 ~ px(88)\n  # ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate indicate that the initiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring depends greatly on its potential success rate. Coup plotters carefully assess their chances before staging a coup. If they decide to proceed, it suggests that the conditions are relatively ripe, hence the fifty-fifty success rate. Plans with immature conditions and low chances of success will be filtered out. Fundamentally, launching a coup is not like participating in a general election, where failure in one election allows for another attempt in the next election. A coup is a high-stakes gamble where success brings substantial rewards, while failure may result in martyrdom. Failure, put differently, means permanent and absolute defeat. Furthermore, the outcomes of coups are typically decided within a matter of days, sometimes even mere hours. Unlike prolonged conflicts where victories or defeats may shift over time, the success of a coup is often sealed at its inception. Every detail must be meticulously planned and arranged beforehand.\nHence, the factors influencing the success rates of coups play a significant role in shaping coup attempts. This study employs a sample selection model to examine the factors affecting the success rates of coups and, consequently, the likelihood of coup attempts. I posit that the power dynamics among coup perpetrators, incumbents, and other ruling elites are pivotal in determining the success of coups. These dynamics are largely contingent on regime types, highlighting the pivotal role of regime types in shaping coup attempts.\nThis study offers two potential contributions to the existing literature: firstly, it highlights the significance of power dynamics within various regime types as critical factors influencing coup attempts; secondly, it demonstrates how sample selection models can enhance our understanding of coup attempts by taking into account the success rates of coups.\nThe subsequent section of this paper explores the dynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. In Part 3, I detail the research design, outlining the methodology and variables used in the analysis. Part 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Finally, Part 5 concludes the study, summarizing the key insights and their implications.\nhttps://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/home.htm, accessed on 2024-05-23"

    "text": "2 Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\nWhen contemplating a coup, plotters grapple with two crucial factors that also occupy coup scholars: disposition (why they take the risk) and capability (whether they can succeed).\n\n2.1 Disposition: Motivations for Coups\nCoup motivations can be categorized into three main types:\nPersonal Ambition: The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth for themselves, family, and close associates is a significant motivator. Wintrobe (2019) distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on their use of power. Totalitarian leaders control every aspect of life, relishing their authority. Tinpot leaders, however, prioritize personal enrichment, indulging in extravagant lifestyles.\nPurported National Interest: Sometimes, coups are justified as rescuing a nation in crisis, upholding the constitution, or facilitating a democratic transition. However, scepticism is warranted, as self-serving plotters often use such rhetoric. Nevertheless, legitimate cases exist. In 2010, a coup in Niger ousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term. His actions, including dissolving the opposing Constitutional Court and calling a self-serving referendum, triggered a coup to protect the constitution (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019).\nSelf-Preservation: In rare instances, coups serve as a last resort against imminent political persecution. Coup leaders might not seek power but fear elimination by the incumbent leader. Consequently, the coup becomes a pre-emptive strike rather than an ambitious power grab. An example is Idi Amin, who, in 1971, staged a coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his position as army commander-in-chief (Sudduth 2017).\nWhile these motivations can arise in any regime, autocracies are more susceptible, particularly for the latter two types. Stable democracies rarely face such constitutional crises or political persecutions that necessitate coups to protect them. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and democratic backsliding which coup plotters can then use as a pretext to justify their actions.\nDespite these potential motivations, coups are relatively uncommon, occurring in only \\(4\\%\\) of country-years since 1950. This is because even the most determined coup plotters require the capability to succeed, which we will explore in the next section. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure.\n\n2.2 Capability\nWhile there may be numerous ambitious political figures vying to seize supreme power for various reasons, only a select few have the opportunity to orchestrate a coup. What truly determines their ability to launch a coup, however, is not merely their willingness, but their capability. Yet, compared to the incumbent, coup plotters naturally face disadvantages.\nFirstly, as previously mentioned, coups constitute illegal actions against incumbent leaders. To avoid the severe consequences of exposure or failure, coup plots must remain clandestine within a tightly knit core group. Coup plotters cannot openly recruit supporters to bolster their strength, while incumbents can openly implement coup-proofing strategies to thwart coup attempts.\nSecondly, coup plotters are uncertain about how other ruling factions might react to their actions, particularly those capable of altering the balance of power. Conversely, incumbent leaders possess a keen understanding of power dynamics and take proactive measures to tilt the balance in their favour. Though unaware of specific coup instigators, incumbent leaders are keenly aware of potential threats and adapt accordingly to those who possess the capability to challenge them.\nThirdly, coup plotters grapple with a loyalty dilemma and unreliable commitment among participants. The risks involved are considerable, and anticipated benefits are highly uncertain. Even in the event of a successful coup, there is no guarantee that promises made by coup leaders will be honoured. Additionally, post-coup purges often target capable assistants to pre-empt future challenges. Consequently, defecting to support the incumbent leader seems less risky and offers a safer bet with predictable rewards.\nGiven these challenges, rational coup plotters are unlikely to risk their lives for a coup with low odds of success. Instead, they may opt to abandon their plans or bide their time until success becomes more feasible. Therefore, when coup perpetrators decide to take action, they must have meticulously assessed their chances of success and deemed the risk worthwhile.\nBut what constitutes a ‘good enough’ chance of success for coup plotters to proceed? Before delving into a theoretical framework to analyze this question, let’s first examine historical data to gain a rough idea. Surprisingly, previous coups since 1950 suggest a rather satisfactory success rate, nearly \\(50\\%\\), as depicted in Table 2.\n\n2.3 Framework of coup success\nAn oft-cited framework (Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt 2016; Aidt and Leon 2019) provides a structured approach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of coups can be represented by the equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(1)\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf B\\) represents the return of a successful coup, \\(\\mathbf C\\) signifies the cost of a failed coup, and \\(p\\) represents the probability of coup success. The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B &gt; (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(2)\\]\nEquation 2 implies that for Equation 1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from successful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups.\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying \\(\\mathbf B\\) (the value of a successful coup) and \\(\\mathbf C\\) (the cost of failure) is difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after a successful coup, are intangible concepts that defy precise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup in Ghana1, the fate of the coup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high likely to be killed if the coup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds.\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core logic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the return and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive nature of precise values for \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), they can be treated as roughly equal. Consequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and compare these values precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), to the probability of success (\\(p\\)), simplifying Equation 2 to:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np &gt; (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(3)\\]\nEquation 3 suggests that, to hold Equation 2 true, a success probability greater than \\(50\\%\\) is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat supports this notion. As shown in Table 2, the overall success rate is \\(49.9\\%\\). While this falls short of the \\(50\\%\\) threshold, it’s important to consider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily reflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly, outliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not prioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can propose our first hypothesis:\n\nH1: The primary determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup’s success, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary, the core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the incumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage in this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n2.4 Regime types and power dynamics\nWhen discussing the balance of power, the first aspect that springs to mind is military prowess. It is evident that control over the military grants individuals the upper hand in coup attempts. This elucidates why military coups often take center stage in coup discussions. In much of the literature on coups, the terms “coup” and “military coup” are frequently used interchangeably, as many scholars argue that coups are orchestrated by military personnel through the use or threat of armed forces. J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011) summarise 14 studies on coups, with half of them attributing coup attempts solely to ‘the armed forces’. Consequently, most attention, both from academic researchers and political leaders, is focused on the balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military factions. Strategies such as “Keeping the military content” (Aidt and Leon 2019, 15) or “providing them with resources” (Huntington 1991, 252) have been proposed to mitigate military intervention. Many coup-proofing strategies, informed by empirical research, aim to either decrease the military’s inclination to stage coups or erect barriers to their success. For instance, studies by Leon (2013) suggest that nations with lower military spending as a percentage of GDP are more vulnerable to coups. Similarly, J. Powell et al. (2018) argue that increased military expenditures may diminish the likelihood of coups among military factions.\nHowever, previous studies have often oversimplified the intricate balance of power within military forces. They have frequently assumed that the military operates as a monolithic entity, uniformly and decisively. Such a notion fails to capture the complexities of real-world dynamics.\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the military is not always a unified entity. Regardless of its size, any military force is composed of various groups or factions, each with its own chain of command. Within these factions, mutual suspicion, competition, and vigilance are common, while moments of unity are rare. Due to the clandestine nature of coups and the need for secrecy, coup attempts are often orchestrated within small, tight-knit groups. Coup plotters are uncertain about the stances and intentions of other factions beforehand, and they are particularly worried that once the coup is initiated, other factions may not only refuse to support it but also actively oppose, intervene in, or even suppress it. As in the attempted coup in Niger in 2021, which occurred just two days before the new presidential inauguration, the military unit that staged the coup was swiftly thwarted by Niger’s security forces, resulting in the failure of the coup within an hour2. Therefore, the success of a coup heavily depends on the reactions of other military factions (Geddes 1999).\nMore importantly, the relationship between a government and its military varies significantly across different regime types. In democracies, civilian authority reigns supreme. The military is considered a national institution, bound by the constitution rather than individual leaders, whether military or civilian. For instance, the United States Armed Forces serve under the President’s command but ultimately answer to the Constitution, ensuring they remain politically neutral.\nIn contrast, non-democracies present a more complex picture. The lines of authority are often either poorly defined in written documents or blatantly disregarded by those in actual power. Identifying the true leader of the military hinges on the specific regime type. To explore this further, we will utilize the foundational concepts outlined by by Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF), which categorise autocratic regimes based on leadership origins and decision-making factors. These regimes fall into three broad categories: military regimes, personalist regimes, and dominant-party regimes. Democracies and monarchies will also be included in our analysis for comparative purposes.\nMilitary Regimes\nAs defined by GWF, military regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta – a group of military officers who control the regime’s power structure, including leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the Brazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the Salvadoran regime (1948-1984) (Geddes 1999). Notably, political parties might still exist within military regimes, but they typically act as mouthpieces for the junta or align themselves with the military’s directives to avoid being categorized as dominant-party regimes. Additionally, while a junta may appoint a senior officer as the head of state or utilize civilian administrators as intermediaries, the authority of these intermediaries over other officers remains limited, differentiating military regimes from personalist ones.\nPersonalist Regimes\nIn a typical personalist regime, absolute power rests with a single dictator. This encompasses policy making, control over the military, and the authority to appoint top officials and successors. Personalist regimes often emerge under charismatic leaders, particularly founding figures of newly independent nations. Regimes like Rafael Trujillo’s in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin’s in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s in the Central African Republic (1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule (Geddes 1999). In such regimes, political parties are either absent or completely subservient to the dictator. Importantly, the dictator may or may not have a military background, but the military itself falls under their control.\nDominant-Party Regimes\nIn a dominant-party regime, supreme power resides within the ruling party, with the leader acting as its representative and subject to its collective leadership. Examples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European countries (Geddes 1999). The dominant party is a well-organized and disciplined entity with its own ideology and political agenda used to unite and mobilize its members and supporters. While powerful leaders may emerge within such regimes, like Stalin in the Soviet Union (1924-1953) and Mao Zedong in China (1949-1976), they lack the absolute power to dismantle or replace the party altogether.\nAccording to Geddes (1999), different factions within a regime – military officers, party cadres in dominant-party systems, and members of cliques in personalist regimes – have distinct interests. For instance, professional soldiers prioritize military survival and efficacy, party cadres seek to hold office, and members of cliques depend on supporting the incumbent leader for their own survival and relationships. While their strategies may differ, all ruling groups ultimately prioritize self-preservation and advancement.\nThe key distinction between military, dominant-party, and personalist regimes lies in the unique balance of power established by each. This power dynamic emerges during the power seizure process. The most competent group, be it a military junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically rises to power due to the demanding nature of seizing control. Sudduth (2017) and Roessler (2011) analyse the purging of co-conspirators after power seizures, arguing that these purges are more likely in the early stages of new regimes.\nFollowing internal purges and external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges among the factions within a regime, typically solidifying into one of three main types: military regimes, personalist regimes, or dominant-party regimes.\nDominant-party regimes are the most stable due to their institutionalized structure. A dominant party is a highly organized group with shared political beliefs, goals, and ideologies. This shared ideology fosters internal cohesion and a long-term vision, resulting in a robust structure with no single individual wielding absolute power. The military force aligns with the party itself rather than individual leaders, contributing significantly to greater regime stability compared to personalist or military regimes. Dominant-party regimes also manage leadership succession more effectively, as they typically regulate the process and enforce term limits. As demonstrated by Frantz and Stein (2017), 97% of country-years in dominant-party regimes have formalized institutional succession rules, compared to 77% in personalist regimes and a mere 59% in military regimes.\nPersonalist regimes also exhibit a degree of stability, as dictators usually emerge from intense internal and external competition, with the most competent, tough, and powerful individuals ultimately prevailing. Potential challengers have often been purged, resulting in a relatively stable status quo within the dictator’s close circle. However, personalist regimes are vulnerable due to the sudden death of incumbents. Rarely is there a universally accepted successor during the chaos of power transitions, as incumbent dictators often purge potential rivals. This uncertainty can trigger coups. Thus, while personalist regimes maintain relative stability as long as succession is not an immediate issue.\nIn contrast, military regimes are typically the least stable. These regimes often rule through a junta, where power is shared equally among members. Mistrust and suspicion are common, leading to frequent conflicts over benefits and policies. Without a single authority figure, resolving these conflicts is challenging, as no member is willing to concede, and no senior authority can enforce resolutions. For example, General Augusto Pinochet was chosen to lead the junta in Chile after the 1973 coup because his colleagues saw him as a safe choice due to his professionalism, respect for rules, and uncharismatic demeanor (Arriagada Herrera 1988). Although Pinochet later surprised them, this example illustrates that juntas are generally unstable leadership groups.\nThese differing power dynamics significantly impact the likelihood of coup attempts. Military regimes, in particular, have an inherent predisposition towards coups, as junta members typically command their own military factions, eliminating the need to organize an army for a coup. According to Table 3, military regimes face the highest risk, representing only 5.6% of country-years yet accounting for over 22% of coups. Personalist regimes follow, with 23% of coups despite comprising only 13% of country-years. Dominant-party regimes, with their stronger institutions and unified leadership, have the lowest incidence of coups, constituting 22.6% of country-years but responsible for only 16.7% of coups.\n\nCoderegimes &lt;- REIGN |&gt;\n  distinct(reign_cowcode, year, .keep_all = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    regime_type = case_when(\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\n        \"party-based\",\n        \"party-personal\",\n        \"party-military\",\n        \"party-personal-military\",\n        \"oligarchy\"\n      ) ~ \"dominant-party\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"personal\" ~ \"personal\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"military\", \"military personal\", \"indirect military\") ~ \"military\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"monarchy\" ~ \"monarchy\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"presidential\", \"parliamentary\") ~ \"democracy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1949)\n\nregime_total &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime_type) |&gt; \n  arrange(-n) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(country_year =n,\n         share = percent(percent),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n  \n\ncoup1 &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  select(country, ccode, year, coup)\n\ncoup_by_regime &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(num_of_coups = n,\n         percent_of_coups = percent(percent,accuracy = 0.1),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n\ncoup_by_succeed &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup),\n         coup == 2) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  select(regime, succeeded_coup = n) \n\ncoup_regimes &lt;-  coup_by_regime |&gt; \n  left_join(coup_by_succeed) |&gt; \n  mutate(success_rate = percent(succeeded_coup / num_of_coups, accuracy = 0.1))\n\nregime_total |&gt;\n  left_join(coup_regimes, join_by(regime_type == regime)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime_type = str_to_title(regime_type)) |&gt;\n  select(-succeeded_coup) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Regime types and coups since 1950\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCountry Year\nShare\nNum of Coups\nPercent of Coups\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n5303\n46.7%\n122\n24.8%\n51.6%\n\n\nDominant-Party\n2569\n22.6%\n82\n16.7%\n53.7%\n\n\nPersonal\n1477\n13.0%\n113\n23.0%\n44.2%\n\n\nMonarchy\n1056\n9.3%\n25\n5.1%\n56.0%\n\n\nMilitary\n638\n5.6%\n110\n22.4%\n48.2%\n\n\nOther\n322\n2.8%\n39\n7.9%\n53.8%\n\n\nTotal\n11365\n100.0%\n491\n100.0%\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: REIGN and GIC Datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are more prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes are the least likely to experience coups among the three.\n\nIn the case of the Ghanaian coup, flight lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings narrowly avoided execution after his initial failure, being freed by mutinous soldiers.

    "text": "3 Research Design\n\n3.1 Two-stage sample selection model\nTo account for the determinants of coup attempts, this study utilizes a sample selection model (Heckman 1979). While coup attempt rates vary across regimes, success rates tend to converge around 50% (Table 3). This suggests coup attempts are strategically planned, targeting situations with a perceived high chance of success. Consequently, a standard regression model would yield biased results. Therefore, we use the two-stage probit model, as detailed by Van de Ven and Van Praag (1981) and utilized by J. Powell (2012), for empirical analysis. The first stage examines the probability that a regime experiences a coup attempt, while the second stage evaluates the probability of the attempt’s success.\nThe primary explanatory variables are regime types, as previously discussed. Control variables are included in \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\). The selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt occurs and can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1^*=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XA} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(4)\\]\nHere, \\({y_1}^*\\) is an unobserved variable, which may be known to coup plotters. \\(Regime_i\\) is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or dominant-party). XB captures other control variables, such as the economic crisis index, previous coups, military expenditure, etc.\nThe observed binary outcome \\(\\mathbf{y_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_1^*&gt;0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_1^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the first stage, if \\(y_1^*\\le0\\), no coup attempt occurs in a given country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable does not reach the threshold. If \\(y_1^*&gt;0\\), at least one coup attempt is made in a country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable surpasses the threshold. The probability is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_1 =1)&=Prob(y_{1}^*&gt;0) \\\\\n&=\\Phi(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XA})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(5)\\]\nSimilarly, the outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup attempt is successful, given that it occurs:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2^*=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XB} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(6)\\]\nThe observed outcome \\(y_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_2^*&gt;0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_2^*\\le0$ (coup fails)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe probability equations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_2=1|y_1 =1)=\\Phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XB})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(7)\\]\n\n3.2 Variables\n\n3.2.1 Dependent variable\nTo test our hypotheses, we use coup attempts and outcomes data from J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011) as the dependent variable. Successful coups are those in which the incumbent is removed from office for more than seven days. The dataset spans from 1950 to 2023, accounting for 491 coup attempts, of which 245 were successful. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.\n\n3.2.2 Independent variables\nThe primary independent variable in our analysis is the regime type. We follow the categories defined by Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF). Our main focus is on military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracy and monarchy included as reference categories. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3.\n\n3.2.3 Control variables\nIn selecting control variables, we draw on the research by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), who test the robustness of 66 factors proposed in the empirical literature using a monthly sample of 164 countries from 1952 to 2011. They find that slow economic growth rates, previous coup experiences, and other forms of political violence are particularly conducive to inciting coups. Therefore, our main control variables are economic performance, political violence, and the number of previous coups.\nEconomic performance: We use the current-trend (\\(CT\\)) ratio developed by Krishnarajan (2019) to measure economic performance. This metric calculates the ratio between the current level of gross domestic product per capita (GDP/cap) and the average GDP/cap level of the previous five years. For a country \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\), the \\(CT\\) ratio is calculated as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince a given year’s situation is primarily determined by the previous year, the variable is lagged by one year. The GDP per capita (in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP) is sourced from the V-Dem dataset provided by Fariss et al. (2022).\nViolence: The violence index captures all types of violence and wars (internal or interstate), indicating the stability of the regime. This data is sourced from the Major Episodes of Political Violence (Marshall 2005).\nPrevious coups: This variable captures the number of previous coups in each country. In a two-stage sample selection model, the second-stage model cannot be identical to the first-stage model. Therefore, the first-stage model includes the number of previous coups, while the second-stage does not. Previous coups may have a greater impact on coup attempts, while once a coup is launched, the number of previous coups might not significantly explain the outcome."

    "text": "4 Results and Discussion\n\n4.1 Interpretation and Discussion\nThe findings from the two-stage probit model, as presented in Table \\(\\ref{results}\\), provide valuable insights into the dynamics of coup attempts and their likelihood of success across different regime types:\nAs hypothesized, both the coefficients for military and personalist regimes are positive and significant at the 1% level, indicating a higher likelihood of experiencing coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes, holding other factors constant. This higher propensity for coup attempts in military and personalist regimes aligns with our hypothesis that these regimes face distinct internal power dynamics, increasing the likelihood of coup attempts.\nAll control variables are statistically significant at the 1% level. As expected, better economic performance and higher levels of GDP per capita help reduce the risk of coups. Surprisingly, more previous coups appear to reduce the risk of coups, but this finding is not substantially significant. This indicates that even after accounting for various relevant factors, regime type remains a critical determinant of coup likelihood. This underscores the robustness of our findings and the importance of regime type in understanding coup dynamics.\nIn the outcome equation, most variables are not significant at the 5% level. This supports our hypothesis that coup attempts are highly selective at the attempt stage, which removes the influence of these variables on the coup outcome. Interestingly, higher GDP per capita shows a positive relationship with the likelihood of coup success at the 5% significance level. This suggests that better economic conditions may provide more resources to coup plotters, thereby increasing the chances of a successful coup once attempted. Conversely, weak economies may trigger more coup attempts, though many of these are less likely to succeed.\nThe correlation coefficient (\\(\\rho\\)) between the error terms of the selection and outcome equations is 0.7086 with a p-value of 0.111. Although positive, this correlation is not statistically significant, indicating that there may not be a strong correlation between the errors in the selection and outcome equations. This suggests that the selection bias might not be as severe as initially hypothesized.\nOverall, the regression results indicate that the sample selection model is a well-specified choice for this research. The significant coefficients and theoretically consistent directions suggest that the model effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. Specifically:\n\nThe direction and significance of the coefficients align with theoretical expectations. Regimes with less institutional stability, such as military and personalist regimes, are more likely to experience coup attempts.\nBetter economic conditions, while reducing the likelihood of coup attempts, increase the likelihood of coup success.\nCoup attempts are not random events; they occur under specific conditions. Thus, treating the selection process (whether a coup attempt occurs) separately from the outcome (whether the coup is successful) effectively captures this non-randomness.\nThe Heckman two-step model is designed to correct for selection bias. The similar success rates of coups across different regimes, despite varying attempt rates, indicate potential selection bias. This supports the need for a sample selection model, as coup plotters are likely to attempt coups only when they perceive a high likelihood of success.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of a sample selection model is appropriate for this research, providing robust insights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their outcomes across different regime types. The results highlight the significant role of regime type in coup dynamics and the selective nature of coup attempts, thereby validating the theoretical framework and empirical strategy employed in this study."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\nThe findings of this study underscore the critical role of regime type in determining the likelihood of coup attempts. Through the application of a two-stage sample selection model, this research highlights that coups are significantly more probable in military and personalist regimes compared to dominant-party regimes. The results suggest that the power dynamics inherent in different regime types influence the propensity for coups, with less institutional stability and more fragmented power structures increasing the risk.\nMoreover, the study reveals that better economic conditions, while reducing the overall likelihood of coup attempts, paradoxically enhance the chances of coup success. This implies that economic resources can provide the necessary support for successful coups, even as they deter initial attempts.\nThe significant coefficients and the alignment of results with theoretical expectations validate the use of the sample selection model in this context. By accounting for the selection bias in coup attempts, the model offers robust insights into the factors influencing both the occurrence and success of coups. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of coup dynamics, emphasizing the importance of regime type and economic conditions in shaping political stability.\nIn conclusion, this study provides a nuanced perspective on coup attempts and their outcomes, reinforcing the need to consider regime-specific characteristics and economic contexts in analyses of political instability. Future research could further explore the interplay between these factors and examine additional variables that may influence coup dynamics.\n\n\n\n\nCan.Do.So\n\n\n\n\nAidt, Toke, and Gabriel Leon. 2019. “The Coup.” Edited by Roger D.

Powell and Thyne 2011), Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between \\(1950\\) and \\(1984\\), while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar time frame. However, Mexico’s authoritarian period from \\(1917\\) to \\(2000\\) saw no coups at all. In Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between \\(1955\\) and \\(2023\\), whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since \\(1950\\). Similar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia. The question of why coups occur more frequently in certain regions, countries, and periods, while being less common in others, has captivated scholars for decades. Consequently, scholars have delved into extensive research on coups. Despite numerous efforts in past studies to shed light on these disparities, a definitive model or set of determinants for analysing coups remains elusive. As highlighted by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), although approximately one hundred potential determinants of coups have been suggested, the fundamental question remains unanswered.\nHowever, despite extensive research by scholars, the impact of anticipated outcomes on coup initiation has not received sufficient attention. When analysing the determinants of coups, it is crucial not to overlook the most significant characteristic of coups themselves. As defined by J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011), coups are “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.”(J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011, 252). Due to their illegality, the consequences of a failed coup could be severe, with perpetrators risking imprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, the repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators.\nDespite the significant risks associated with coups, as shown in Table 2 since \\(1950\\), there have still been as many as 491 coups worldwide. Furthermore, more importantly, half of these coups have been successful. At first glance, coups seem to be a high-success-rate, high-reward political venture and speculation. However, compared to over \\(12,000\\) country-years since \\(1950\\), the occurrence of 491 coups appears rather rare, accounting for less than \\(4\\%\\) (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011).\n\nCodecoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt; \n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`, \n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;   \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt; \n  # cols_width(1 ~ px(120),\n  #            2:4 ~ px(88)\n  # ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate indicate that the initiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring depends greatly on its potential success rate. Coup plotters carefully assess their chances before staging a coup. If they decide to proceed, it suggests that the conditions are relatively ripe, hence the fifty-fifty success rate. Plans with immature conditions and low chances of success will be filtered out. Fundamentally, launching a coup is not like participating in a general election, where failure in one election allows for another attempt in the next election. A coup is a high-stakes gamble where success brings substantial rewards, while failure may result in martyrdom. Failure, put differently, means permanent and absolute defeat. Furthermore, the outcomes of coups are typically decided within a matter of days, sometimes even mere hours. Unlike prolonged conflicts where victories or defeats may shift over time, the success of a coup is often sealed at its inception. Every detail must be meticulously planned and arranged beforehand.\nHence, the factors influencing the success rates of coups play a significant role in shaping coup attempts. This study employs a sample selection model to examine the factors affecting the success rates of coups and, consequently, the likelihood of coup attempts. I posit that the power dynamics among coup perpetrators, incumbents, and other ruling elites are pivotal in determining the success of coups. These dynamics are largely contingent on regime types, highlighting the pivotal role of regime types in shaping coup attempts.\nThis study offers two potential contributions to the existing literature: firstly, it highlights the significance of power dynamics within various regime types as critical factors influencing coup attempts; secondly, it demonstrates how sample selection models can enhance our understanding of coup attempts by taking into account the success rates of coups.\nThe subsequent section of this paper explores the dynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. In Part 3, I detail the research design, outlining the methodology and variables used in the analysis. Part 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Finally, Part 5 concludes the study, summarizing the key insights and their implications."

    "text": "2 Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\nWhen contemplating a coup, plotters grapple with two crucial factors that also occupy coup scholars: disposition (why they take the risk) and capability (whether they can succeed).\n\n2.1 Disposition: Motivations for Coups\nCoup motivations can be categorized into three main types:\nPersonal Ambition: The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth for themselves, family, and close associates is a significant motivator. Wintrobe (2019) distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on their use of power. Totalitarian leaders control every aspect of life, relishing their authority. Tinpot leaders, however, prioritize personal enrichment, indulging in extravagant lifestyles.\nPurported National Interest: Sometimes, coups are justified as rescuing a nation in crisis, upholding the constitution, or facilitating a democratic transition. However, scepticism is warranted, as self-serving plotters often use such rhetoric. Nevertheless, legitimate cases exist. In 2010, a coup in Niger ousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term. His actions, including dissolving the opposing Constitutional Court and calling a self-serving referendum, triggered a coup to protect the constitution (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019).\nSelf-Preservation: In rare instances, coups serve as a last resort against imminent political persecution. Coup leaders might not seek power but fear elimination by the incumbent leader. Consequently, the coup becomes a pre-emptive strike rather than an ambitious power grab. An example is Idi Amin, who, in 1971, staged a coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his position as army commander-in-chief (Sudduth 2017).\nWhile these motivations can arise in any regime, autocracies are more susceptible, particularly for the latter two types. Stable democracies rarely face such constitutional crises or political persecutions that necessitate coups to protect them. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and democratic backsliding which coup plotters can then use as a pretext to justify their actions.\nDespite these potential motivations, coups are relatively uncommon, occurring in only \\(4\\%\\) of country-years since 1950. This is because even the most determined coup plotters require the capability to succeed, which we will explore in the next section. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure.\n\n2.2 Capability\nWhile there may be numerous ambitious political figures vying to seize supreme power for various reasons, only a select few have the opportunity to orchestrate a coup. What truly determines their ability to launch a coup, however, is not merely their willingness, but their capability. Yet, compared to the incumbent, coup plotters naturally face disadvantages.\nFirstly, as previously mentioned, coups constitute illegal actions against incumbent leaders. To avoid the severe consequences of exposure or failure, coup plots must remain clandestine within a tightly knit core group. Coup plotters cannot openly recruit supporters to bolster their strength, while incumbents can openly implement coup-proofing strategies to thwart coup attempts.\nSecondly, coup plotters are uncertain about how other ruling factions might react to their actions, particularly those capable of altering the balance of power. Conversely, incumbent leaders possess a keen understanding of power dynamics and take proactive measures to tilt the balance in their favour. Though unaware of specific coup instigators, incumbent leaders are keenly aware of potential threats and adapt accordingly to those who possess the capability to challenge them.\nThirdly, coup plotters grapple with a loyalty dilemma and unreliable commitment among participants. The risks involved are considerable, and anticipated benefits are highly uncertain. Even in the event of a successful coup, there is no guarantee that promises made by coup leaders will be honoured. Additionally, post-coup purges often target capable assistants to pre-empt future challenges. Consequently, defecting to support the incumbent leader seems less risky and offers a safer bet with predictable rewards.\nGiven these challenges, rational coup plotters are unlikely to risk their lives for a coup with low odds of success. Instead, they may opt to abandon their plans or bide their time until success becomes more feasible. Therefore, when coup perpetrators decide to take action, they must have meticulously assessed their chances of success and deemed the risk worthwhile.\nBut what constitutes a ‘good enough’ chance of success for coup plotters to proceed? Before delving into a theoretical framework to analyze this question, let’s first examine historical data to gain a rough idea. Surprisingly, previous coups since 1950 suggest a rather satisfactory success rate, nearly \\(50\\%\\), as depicted in Table 2.\n\n2.3 Framework of coup success\nAn oft-cited framework (Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt 2016; Aidt and Leon 2019) provides a structured approach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of coups can be represented by the equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf B\\) represents the return of a successful coup, \\(\\mathbf C\\) signifies the cost of a failed coup, and \\(p\\) represents the probability of coup success. The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B &gt; (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nEquation 2 implies that for Equation 1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from successful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups.\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying \\(\\mathbf B\\) (the value of a successful coup) and \\(\\mathbf C\\) (the cost of failure) is difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after a successful coup, are intangible concepts that defy precise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup in Ghana2, the fate of the coup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high likely to be killed if the coup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds.\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core logic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the return and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive nature of precise values for \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), they can be treated as roughly equal. Consequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and compare these values precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), to the probability of success (\\(p\\)), simplifying Equation 2 to:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np &gt; (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nEquation 3 suggests that, to hold Equation 2 true, a success probability greater than \\(50\\%\\) is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat supports this notion. As shown in Table 2, the overall success rate is \\(49.9\\%\\). While this falls short of the \\(50\\%\\) threshold, it’s important to consider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily reflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly, outliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not prioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can propose our first hypothesis:\n\nH1: The primary determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup’s success, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary, the core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the incumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage in this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n2.4 Regime types and power dynamics\nWhen discussing the balance of power, the first aspect that springs to mind is military prowess. It is evident that control over the military grants individuals the upper hand in coup attempts. This elucidates why military coups often take center stage in coup discussions. In much of the literature on coups, the terms “coup” and “military coup” are frequently used interchangeably, as many scholars argue that coups are orchestrated by military personnel through the use or threat of armed forces. J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011) summarise 14 studies on coups, with half of them attributing coup attempts solely to ‘the armed forces’. Consequently, most attention, both from academic researchers and political leaders, is focused on the balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military factions. Strategies such as “Keeping the military content” (Aidt and Leon 2019, 15) or “providing them with resources” (Huntington 1991, 252) have been proposed to mitigate military intervention. Many coup-proofing strategies, informed by empirical research, aim to either decrease the military’s inclination to stage coups or erect barriers to their success. For instance, studies by Leon (2013) suggest that nations with lower military spending as a percentage of GDP are more vulnerable to coups. Similarly, J. Powell et al. (2018) argue that increased military expenditures may diminish the likelihood of coups among military factions.\nHowever, previous studies have often oversimplified the intricate balance of power within military forces. They have frequently assumed that the military operates as a monolithic entity, uniformly and decisively. Such a notion fails to capture the complexities of real-world dynamics.\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that the military is not always a unified entity. Regardless of its size, any military force is composed of various groups or factions, each with its own chain of command. Within these factions, mutual suspicion, competition, and vigilance are common, while moments of unity are rare. Due to the clandestine nature of coups and the need for secrecy, coup attempts are often orchestrated within small, tight-knit groups. Coup plotters are uncertain about the stances and intentions of other factions beforehand, and they are particularly worried that once the coup is initiated, other factions may not only refuse to support it but also actively oppose, intervene in, or even suppress it. As in the attempted coup in Niger in 2021, which occurred just two days before the new presidential inauguration, the military unit that staged the coup was swiftly thwarted by Niger’s security forces, resulting in the failure of the coup within an hour3. Therefore, the success of a coup heavily depends on the reactions of other military factions (Geddes 1999).\nMore importantly, the relationship between a government and its military varies significantly across different regime types. In democracies, civilian authority reigns supreme. The military is considered a national institution, bound by the constitution rather than individual leaders, whether military or civilian. For instance, the United States Armed Forces serve under the President’s command but ultimately answer to the Constitution, ensuring they remain politically neutral.\nIn contrast, non-democracies present a more complex picture. The lines of authority are often either poorly defined in written documents or blatantly disregarded by those in actual power. Identifying the true leader of the military hinges on the specific regime type. To explore this further, we will utilize the foundational concepts outlined by by Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF), which categorise autocratic regimes based on leadership origins and decision-making factors. These regimes fall into three broad categories: military regimes, personalist regimes, and dominant-party regimes. Democracies and monarchies will also be included in our analysis for comparative purposes.\nMilitary Regimes\nAs defined by GWF, military regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta – a group of military officers who control the regime’s power structure, including leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the Brazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the Salvadoran regime (1948-1984) (Geddes 1999). Notably, political parties might still exist within military regimes, but they typically act as mouthpieces for the junta or align themselves with the military’s directives to avoid being categorized as dominant-party regimes. Additionally, while a junta may appoint a senior officer as the head of state or utilize civilian administrators as intermediaries, the authority of these intermediaries over other officers remains limited, differentiating military regimes from personalist ones.\nPersonalist Regimes\nIn a typical personalist regime, absolute power rests with a single dictator. This encompasses policy making, control over the military, and the authority to appoint top officials and successors. Personalist regimes often emerge under charismatic leaders, particularly founding figures of newly independent nations. Regimes like Rafael Trujillo’s in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin’s in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s in the Central African Republic (1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule (Geddes 1999). In such regimes, political parties are either absent or completely subservient to the dictator. Importantly, the dictator may or may not have a military background, but the military itself falls under their control.\nDominant-Party Regimes\nIn a dominant-party regime, supreme power resides within the ruling party, with the leader acting as its representative and subject to its collective leadership. Examples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European countries (Geddes 1999). The dominant party is a well-organized and disciplined entity with its own ideology and political agenda used to unite and mobilize its members and supporters. While powerful leaders may emerge within such regimes, like Stalin in the Soviet Union (1924-1953) and Mao Zedong in China (1949-1976), they lack the absolute power to dismantle or replace the party altogether.\nAccording to Geddes (1999), different factions within a regime – military officers, party cadres in dominant-party systems, and members of cliques in personalist regimes – have distinct interests. For instance, professional soldiers prioritize military survival and efficacy, party cadres seek to hold office, and members of cliques depend on supporting the incumbent leader for their own survival and relationships. While their strategies may differ, all ruling groups ultimately prioritize self-preservation and advancement.\nThe key distinction between military, dominant-party, and personalist regimes lies in the unique balance of power established by each. This power dynamic emerges during the power seizure process. The most competent group, be it a military junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically rises to power due to the demanding nature of seizing control. Sudduth (2017) and Roessler (2011) analyse the purging of co-conspirators after power seizures, arguing that these purges are more likely in the early stages of new regimes.\nFollowing internal purges and external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges among the factions within a regime, typically solidifying into one of three main types: military regimes, personalist regimes, or dominant-party regimes.\nDominant-party regimes are the most stable due to their institutionalized structure. A dominant party is a highly organized group with shared political beliefs, goals, and ideologies. This shared ideology fosters internal cohesion and a long-term vision, resulting in a robust structure with no single individual wielding absolute power. The military force aligns with the party itself rather than individual leaders, contributing significantly to greater regime stability compared to personalist or military regimes. Dominant-party regimes also manage leadership succession more effectively, as they typically regulate the process and enforce term limits. As demonstrated by Frantz and Stein (2017), 97% of country-years in dominant-party regimes have formalized institutional succession rules, compared to 77% in personalist regimes and a mere 59% in military regimes.\nPersonalist regimes also exhibit a degree of stability, as dictators usually emerge from intense internal and external competition, with the most competent, tough, and powerful individuals ultimately prevailing. Potential challengers have often been purged, resulting in a relatively stable status quo within the dictator’s close circle. However, personalist regimes are vulnerable due to the sudden death of incumbents. Rarely is there a universally accepted successor during the chaos of power transitions, as incumbent dictators often purge potential rivals. This uncertainty can trigger coups. Thus, while personalist regimes maintain relative stability as long as succession is not an immediate issue.\nIn contrast, military regimes are typically the least stable. These regimes often rule through a junta, where power is shared equally among members. Mistrust and suspicion are common, leading to frequent conflicts over benefits and policies. Without a single authority figure, resolving these conflicts is challenging, as no member is willing to concede, and no senior authority can enforce resolutions. For example, General Augusto Pinochet was chosen to lead the junta in Chile after the 1973 coup because his colleagues saw him as a safe choice due to his professionalism, respect for rules, and uncharismatic demeanor (Arriagada Herrera 1988). Although Pinochet later surprised them, this example illustrates that juntas are generally unstable leadership groups.\nThese differing power dynamics significantly impact the likelihood of coup attempts. Military regimes, in particular, have an inherent predisposition towards coups, as junta members typically command their own military factions, eliminating the need to organize an army for a coup. According to Table 3, military regimes face the highest risk, representing only 5.6% of country-years yet accounting for over 22% of coups. Personalist regimes follow, with 23% of coups despite comprising only 13% of country-years. Dominant-party regimes, with their stronger institutions and unified leadership, have the lowest incidence of coups, constituting 22.6% of country-years but responsible for only 16.7% of coups.\n\nCoderegimes &lt;- REIGN |&gt;\n  distinct(reign_cowcode, year, .keep_all = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    regime_type = case_when(\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\n        \"party-based\",\n        \"party-personal\",\n        \"party-military\",\n        \"party-personal-military\",\n        \"oligarchy\"\n      ) ~ \"dominant-party\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"personal\" ~ \"personal\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"military\", \"military personal\", \"indirect military\") ~ \"military\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"monarchy\" ~ \"monarchy\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"presidential\", \"parliamentary\") ~ \"democracy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1949)\n\nregime_total &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime_type) |&gt; \n  arrange(-n) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(country_year =n,\n         share = percent(percent),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n  \n\ncoup1 &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  select(country, ccode, year, coup)\n\ncoup_by_regime &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(num_of_coups = n,\n         percent_of_coups = percent(percent,accuracy = 0.1),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n\ncoup_by_succeed &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup),\n         coup == 2) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  select(regime, succeeded_coup = n) \n\ncoup_regimes &lt;-  coup_by_regime |&gt; \n  left_join(coup_by_succeed) |&gt; \n  mutate(success_rate = percent(succeeded_coup / num_of_coups, accuracy = 0.1))\n\nregime_total |&gt;\n  left_join(coup_regimes, join_by(regime_type == regime)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime_type = str_to_title(regime_type)) |&gt;\n  select(-succeeded_coup) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*\"))\n\n\nTable 3: Regime types and coups since 1950\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCountry Year\nShare\nNum of Coups\nPercent of Coups\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n5303\n46.7%\n122\n24.8%\n51.6%\n\n\nDominant-Party\n2569\n22.6%\n82\n16.7%\n53.7%\n\n\nPersonal\n1477\n13.0%\n113\n23.0%\n44.2%\n\n\nMonarchy\n1056\n9.3%\n25\n5.1%\n56.0%\n\n\nMilitary\n638\n5.6%\n110\n22.4%\n48.2%\n\n\nOther\n322\n2.8%\n39\n7.9%\n53.8%\n\n\nTotal\n11365\n100.0%\n491\n100.0%\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: REIGN and GIC Datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are more prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes are the least likely to experience coups among the three."

    "text": "3 Research Design\n\n3.1 Two-stage sample selection model\nTo account for the determinants of coup attempts, this study utilizes a sample selection model (Heckman 1979). While coup attempt rates vary across regimes, success rates tend to converge around 50% (Table 3). This suggests coup attempts are strategically planned, targeting situations with a perceived high chance of success. Consequently, a standard regression model would yield biased results. Therefore, we use the two-stage probit model, as detailed by Van de Ven and Van Praag (1981) and utilized by J. Powell (2012), for empirical analysis. The first stage examines the probability that a regime experiences a coup attempt, while the second stage evaluates the probability of the attempt’s success.\nThe primary explanatory variables are regime types, as previously discussed. Control variables are included in \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\). The selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt occurs and can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1^*=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XA} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nHere, \\({y_1}^*\\) is an unobserved variable, which may be known to coup plotters. \\(Regime_i\\) is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or dominant-party).

M. Powell and Thyne (2011) as the dependent variable. Successful coups are those in which the incumbent is removed from office for more than seven days. The dataset spans from 1950 to 2023, accounting for 491 coup attempts, of which 245 were successful. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 2 and Table 3.\n\n3.2.2 Independent variables\nThe primary independent variable in our analysis is the regime type. We follow the categories defined by Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF). Our main focus is on military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracy and monarchy included as reference categories. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3.\n\n3.2.3 Control variables\nIn selecting control variables, we draw on the research by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), who test the robustness of 66 factors proposed in the empirical literature using a monthly sample of 164 countries from 1952 to 2011. They find that slow economic growth rates, previous coup experiences, and other forms of political violence are particularly conducive to inciting coups. Therefore, our main control variables are economic performance, political violence, and the number of previous coups.\nEconomic performance: We use the current-trend (\\(CT\\)) ratio developed by Krishnarajan (2019) to measure economic performance. This metric calculates the ratio between the current level of gross domestic product per capita (GDP/cap) and the average GDP/cap level of the previous five years. For a country \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\), the \\(CT\\) ratio is calculated as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince a given year’s situation is primarily determined by the previous year, the variable is lagged by one year. The GDP per capita (in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP) is sourced from the V-Dem dataset provided by Fariss et al. (2022).\nViolence: The violence index captures all types of violence and wars (internal or interstate), indicating the stability of the regime. This data is sourced from the Major Episodes of Political Violence (Marshall 2005).\nPrevious coups: This variable captures the number of previous coups in each country. In a two-stage sample selection model, the second-stage model cannot be identical to the first-stage model. Therefore, the first-stage model includes the number of previous coups, while the second-stage does not. Previous coups may have a greater impact on coup attempts, while once a coup is launched, the number of previous coups might not significantly explain the outcome."

    "text": "4 Results and Discussion\n\n4.1 Interpretation and Discussion\nThe findings from the two-stage probit model, as presented in Table \\(\\ref{results}\\), provide valuable insights into the dynamics of coup attempts and their likelihood of success across different regime types:\nAs hypothesized, both the coefficients for military and personalist regimes are positive and significant at the 1% level, indicating a higher likelihood of experiencing coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes, holding other factors constant. This higher propensity for coup attempts in military and personalist regimes aligns with our hypothesis that these regimes face distinct internal power dynamics, increasing the likelihood of coup attempts.\nAll control variables are statistically significant at the 1% level. As expected, better economic performance and higher levels of GDP per capita help reduce the risk of coups. Surprisingly, more previous coups appear to reduce the risk of coups, but this finding is not substantially significant. This indicates that even after accounting for various relevant factors, regime type remains a critical determinant of coup likelihood. This underscores the robustness of our findings and the importance of regime type in understanding coup dynamics.\nIn the outcome equation, most variables are not significant at the 5% level. This supports our hypothesis that coup attempts are highly selective at the attempt stage, which removes the influence of these variables on the coup outcome. Interestingly, higher GDP per capita shows a positive relationship with the likelihood of coup success at the 5% significance level. This suggests that better economic conditions may provide more resources to coup plotters, thereby increasing the chances of a successful coup once attempted. Conversely, weak economies may trigger more coup attempts, though many of these are less likely to succeed.\nThe correlation coefficient (\\(\\rho\\)) between the error terms of the selection and outcome equations is 0.7086 with a p-value of 0.111. Although positive, this correlation is not statistically significant, indicating that there may not be a strong correlation between the errors in the selection and outcome equations. This suggests that the selection bias might not be as severe as initially hypothesized.\nOverall, the regression results indicate that the sample selection model is a well-specified choice for this research. The significant coefficients and theoretically consistent directions suggest that the model effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. Specifically:\n\nThe direction and significance of the coefficients align with theoretical expectations. Regimes with less institutional stability, such as military and personalist regimes, are more likely to experience coup attempts.\nBetter economic conditions, while reducing the likelihood of coup attempts, increase the likelihood of coup success.\nCoup attempts are not random events; they occur under specific conditions. Thus, treating the selection process (whether a coup attempt occurs) separately from the outcome (whether the coup is successful) effectively captures this non-randomness.\nThe Heckman two-step model is designed to correct for selection bias. The similar success rates of coups across different regimes, despite varying attempt rates, indicate potential selection bias. This supports the need for a sample selection model, as coup plotters are likely to attempt coups only when they perceive a high likelihood of success.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of a sample selection model is appropriate for this research, providing robust insights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their outcomes across different regime types. The results highlight the significant role of regime type in coup dynamics and the selective nature of coup attempts, thereby validating the theoretical framework and empirical strategy employed in this study."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\nThe findings of this study underscore the critical role of regime type in determining the likelihood of coup attempts. Through the application of a two-stage sample selection model, this research highlights that coups are significantly more probable in military and personalist regimes compared to dominant-party regimes. The results suggest that the power dynamics inherent in different regime types influence the propensity for coups, with less institutional stability and more fragmented power structures increasing the risk.\nMoreover, the study reveals that better economic conditions, while reducing the overall likelihood of coup attempts, paradoxically enhance the chances of coup success. This implies that economic resources can provide the necessary support for successful coups, even as they deter initial attempts.\nThe significant coefficients and the alignment of results with theoretical expectations validate the use of the sample selection model in this context. By accounting for the selection bias in coup attempts, the model offers robust insights into the factors influencing both the occurrence and success of coups. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of coup dynamics, emphasizing the importance of regime type and economic conditions in shaping political stability.\nIn conclusion, this study provides a nuanced perspective on coup attempts and their outcomes, reinforcing the need to consider regime-specific characteristics and economic contexts in analyses of political instability. Future research could further explore the interplay between these factors and examine additional variables that may influence coup dynamics."

    "text": "4 Reading the data as a Partquet file\nThanks to arrow, this code will work regardless of how large the underlying dataset is. But it’s currently rather slow: on mycomputer, it took 20 seconds or longer to run. That’s not terrible given how much data we have, but we can make it much faster by switching to a better format.\n\n4.1 Rewriting the Seattle library data as a Parquet file\n```{r}\nseattle_csv |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear) |&gt;\n  write_dataset(path = \"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", format = \"parquet\")\n```\nIt took about 30 seconds to write the dataset as a Parquet file, which is 4,42 GB in size, less than half the size of the original CSV file. Let’s take a look at what we just produced:\n\nCodetibble(\n  files = list.files(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", recursive = TRUE),\n  size_MB = file.size(file.path(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", files)) / 1024^2\n)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOur single 9GB CSV file has been rewritten into 18 parquet files. The file names use a “self-describing” convention used by the Apache Hive project. Hive-style partitions name folders with a “key=value” convention, so as you might guess, the CheckoutYear=2005 directory contains all the data where CheckoutYear is 2005. Each file is between 100 and 300 MB and the total size is now around 4 GB, a little over half the size of the original CSV file. This is as we expect since parquet is a much more efficient format.\n\n4.2 Using dplyr with arrow\nNow we’ve created these parquet files, we’ll need to read them in again. We use open_dataset() again, but this time we give it a directory:\n\nCodeseattle_pq &lt;- open_dataset(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\")\n\n\nNow we can write our dplyr pipeline. For example, we could count the total number of books checked out in each month for the last five years:\n\nCodequery &lt;- seattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear &gt;= 2018, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth)\n\n\nWriting dplyr code for arrow data is conceptually similar to dbplyr, Chapter 21: you write dplyr code, which is automatically transformed into a query that the Apache Arrow C++ library understands, which is then executed when you call collect(). If we print out the query object we can see a little information about what we expect Arrow to return when the execution takes place. And we can get the results by calling collect():\n\nCodequery\n\nFileSystemDataset (query)\nCheckoutYear: int32\nCheckoutMonth: int64\nTotalCheckouts: int64\n\n* Grouped by CheckoutYear\n* Sorted by CheckoutYear [asc], CheckoutMonth [asc]\nSee $.data for the source Arrow object\n\nCodequery |&gt; \n  collect()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLet’s compare the time it took to count the Checkouts by year using the CSV file and the Parquet file and see if it worth the trouble.\n\nCodecsvtime &lt;- seattle_csv |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\ncsvtime\n\n   user  system elapsed \n 20.009   3.322  20.048 \n\n\n\nCodepqtime &lt;- seattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\npqtime\n\n   user  system elapsed \n  0.449   0.071   0.131 \n\n\nParquet file took 0.131 seconds while csv file took 20.048 seconds.

If you desire LaTeX output, just remove the type option from the code below.\n\nAlso, while I have added an example for many of the available stargazer options, I have not included all of them. So while you’re likely to find a relevant example don’t assume if it’s not listed that stargazer can’t do it. Check the documentation for additional features and updates to the package. It is often the case that an omitted argument is specific for LaTeX output and I can’t demonstrate it here.\n\nHTML formatting\nIt is possible to change the formatting of html tables generated with stargazer via an html style sheet.

For this example I will display the same model twice and adjust the standard errors in the second column with the HC1 correction from the sandwich package (i.e. the same correction Stata uses).\nI also need to adjust the F statistic with the corrected variance-covariance matrix (matching Stata’s results).
