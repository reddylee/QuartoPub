If you desire LaTeX output, just remove the type option from the code below.\n\nAlso, while I have added an example for many of the available stargazer options, I have not included all of them. So while you’re likely to find a relevant example don’t assume if it’s not listed that stargazer can’t do it. Check the documentation for additional features and updates to the package. It is often the case that an omitted argument is specific for LaTeX output and I can’t demonstrate it here.\n\n2.1 HTML formatting\nIt is possible to change the formatting of html tables generated with stargazer via an html style sheet.

For this example I will display the same model twice and adjust the standard errors in the second column with the HC1 correction from the sandwich package (i.e. the same correction Stata uses).\nI also need to adjust the F statistic with the corrected variance-covariance matrix (matching Stata’s results).

    "text": "The study of irregular power transitions, encompassing both irregular entries and exits from office, has long been a central topic in political science. However, one form of irregular power transition - the incumbent leader’s refusal to relinquish power - remains relatively understudied. This scenario, where leaders overstay their mandated term limits for one or more terms, or even indefinitely, lacks a universally accepted term in the existing literature. To address this gap, this study adopts the term “autocoup” to denote this phenomenon.\nCoups, being the primary form of irregular power transitions, have received significant scholarly attention. Research by Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009) indicate that coups account for a substantial portion of such transitions, with roughly two-thirds (65.8%) of 374 irregular exits occurring through coups. Additionally, Frantz and Stein (2016) demonstrate that coups are the most common form of exit in autocracies, surpassing regular transitions by a third.\nHowever, while coups were once frequent, recent decades have witnessed a decline in their occurrence (Bermeo 2016; Thyne and Powell 2019). Conversely, autocoups appear to be on the rise, particularly since the Cold War’s end (Ginsburg, Melton, and Elkins 2010; Baturo 2014; Versteeg et al. 2020).

Firstly, autocoups are typically accompanied by a disregard for the rule of law, weakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or authoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful autocoups increase the risk of future irregular power transitions. Research indicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who overstayed their term limits through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either ousted or assassinated while in office (Baturo 2019). Thirdly, failed autocoups often trigger instability that fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.\nDespite their significance, autocoups are understudied compared to traditional coups. Although several relevant concepts and terminologies such as self-coups, autocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay, and continuismo have been proposed and discussed (Marsteintredet and Malamud 2019; Baturo and Tolstrup 2022), there is no clear and widely accepted term to describe these events.

    "section": "\n2 Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions",
    "text": "2 Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\nCompared to coups, which are clearly defined and widely accepted as illegal attempts by elites within the ruling group to overthrow the leadership (Powell and Thyne 2011), the concept of autocoups (also known as self-coups or autogolpes) suffers from a lack of consistency and clarity. This ambiguity hinders our understanding and study of a critical phenomenon in irregular power transitions. To address this gap, we need to tackle two key issues: terminology and definition.\n\n2.1 Terminology\nThe most common term in autocoup literature is self-coup, or autogolpe in Spanish (Przeworski et al. 2000; Maxwell A. Cameron 1998a; Bermeo 2016; Helmke 2017; Marsteintredet and Malamud 2019). This term gained academic prominence after Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree in 1992 (Mauceri 1995; Maxwell A. Cameron 1998b). However, as Marsteintredet and Malamud (2019) point out, the term “self-coup” can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself, which is inaccurate since it is not self-directed but targets other state institutions or apparatus.\nAnother approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use terms with adjectives or modifiers, such as presidential coup, executive coup, constitutional coup, electoral coup, judicial coup, slow-motion coup, soft coup, and parliamentary coup (Marsteintredet and Malamud 2019). While these terms can be helpful in specific contexts, their proliferation often adds to the overall confusion rather than providing clarification. Most of these terms focus on the specific methods used by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify the perpetrator, necessitating further explanation. In fact, many of these methods could be employed either by or against executive leaders.\nA third alternative involves terms like “incumbent takeover” or “overstay”. Incumbent takeover referrs to “an event perpetuated by a ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or informal constraints on his/her power” (Baturo and Tolstrup 2022, 374), based on earlier research (Svolik 2014). While overstay is defined as “staying longer than the maximum term as it stood when the candidate originally came in office” (Ginsburg, Melton, and Elkins 2011, 1844). These terms identify the perpetrator (the incumbent) and/or the nature of the event (overstaying/extending power). However, they do not highlight the illegality or illegitimacy of these actions. Therefore, they cannot serve as a direct counterpart to “coup,” which clearly denotes the illegality of leadership ousters, while “takeover” or “overstay” diminish the severity.\nTherefore, this study strongly advocates for “autocoup” as the most accurate and appropriate term. It avoids the pitfalls of other terms by clearly conveying the essence of the phenomenon as a coup-like power grab and effectively distinguishing autocoups from classical coups by highlighting the perpetrator.\n\n2.2 Definition\nWhile terminology is important, another issue arises with the previous definition of autocoups: should we emphasize power expansion or power extension? Power Expansion refers to situations where an executive branch expands its power beyond its original boundaries, often by encroaching on the authority of other branches like the legislature or judiciary. Power Extension, on the other hand, refers to situations where a leader extends their tenure in office beyond the originally mandated term limits. Existing definitions of self-coup or autocoup sometimes touch upon power extensions, but they primarily focus on power expansions, which has several drawbacks.\nFirstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align well with the definition of a coup. When we define a classical coup, the focus is clearly on the ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or restriction on their power. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition of an autocoup should prioritize the extension of executive leadership. We would not classify an event as a coup if a vice president seizes some power from the president, as long as the president remains in office. Similarly, an executive leader acquiring more power from other branches should not automatically qualify as an autocoup if their term limits remain unchanged.\nSecondly, emphasizing power expansion raises issues regarding the purpose of launching an autocoup. As Maxwell A. Cameron (1998a) defined, a self-coup is “a temporary suspension of the constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who rules by decree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to ratify a political system with broader executive power” (Maxwell A. Cameron 1998a, 220). However, without extending their time in office, the leader faces significant risks once their term expires, as they could face legal or political repercussions for the autocoup itself, leaving behind an overly powerful executive branch for the successor. Although the term “self-coup” gained prominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which initially involved seizing power from other institutions, it is important to note that Fujimori ultimately extended his term limits through constitutional amendments. The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, which he won with popularity in April 1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of “authentic interpretation” which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000, which he won amid suspicions and rumors. However, he did not survive the third term. In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took refuge in Japan (Ezrow 2019).\nThirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be challenging. Power expansion might occur as a sudden, significant event, as seen with Fujimori in 1992, or it could be gradual and incremental, as in the case of Putin since assuming power in 1999 (Chaisty 2019). In the latter case, it is unclear whether each step should be considered an autocoup or if the entire process together should be labelled as such. If the latter, determining the point at which it becomes an autocoup is again problematic.\nTherefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should prioritize power extension as the core characteristic.\nIn light of this discussion, we formally define an autocoup as the practice of current political leaders extending their time in office beyond their originally mandated term limits. Three key points need to be highlighted for this definition. Firstly, this definition refers to the actual leaders of the country, regardless of their official titles. Typically, this would be the president; however, in some cases, such as in Germany, the primary leader is the premier, as the president is a nominal head of state. Secondly, while the primary characteristic of an autocoup is extending the term in office, this definition does not exclude instances of power expansion. Both aspects can coexist, but the extension of the term is the central element. Thirdly, autocoups, by their nature, subvert legal norms and established power transfer mechanisms. While they may employ seemingly legal tactics, their essence is illegitimacy. This critical aspect will be explored further in Chapter III."

    "section": "\n3 Autocoup dataset",
    "text": "3 Autocoup dataset\n\n3.1 Defining the scope\nDefining any concept or term inevitably involves borderline cases that are difficult to categorize. In the context of autocoups, it is particularly challenging to determine whether a specific instance of overstaying should be coded as an autocoup. To avoid ambiguity and dilemmas, we will code all instances of incumbents extending their original mandated term in office as autocoups, regardless of whether the extension is patently illegal or superficially legal.\nThis approach is taken because a truly legitimate amendment to power transition institutions should only apply to subsequent leaders, not the incumbent. If the incumbent changes the rules to their own benefit, the legitimacy of such changes is questionable, even if the amendment procedures appear legal. We have valid reasons to question their motivations since they are the beneficiaries of these reforms.\nEven so, some cases remain unclear. For example, consider a two-term limit presidency where the leader wins a second term. Allegations of election rigging might surface, raising suspicions about the fairness of the election results. If such suspicions can be verified with evidence or judicial verdict, the case would undoubtedly be coded as an autocoup. However, proving election rigging in countries with powerful executives can be difficult. In such instances, we will not classify it as an autocoup unless a formal judicial verdict confirms the rigging.\nEven in contexts where leaders lack clear term limits or the constitution allows indefinite terms, identifying autocoups remains possible. We will discuss and explain this in the next section.\n\n3.2 Classifying autocoups\n\nAutocoups can manifest in various forms. To understand this phenomenon better, we can categorize them based on several key factors:\n\nMethods Employed: This refers to the specific strategies incumbents use to extend their hold on power. Examples include constitution amending or reinterpreting, election cancelling, delaying or rigging.\nDegree of Legality: This dimension captures the extent to which an autocoup deviates from established legal norms. It can range from minor rule-bending to outright constitutional violations.\nDuration of Extension: This category focuses on the length of time the incumbent leader remains in office beyond their designated term limits. It could be a single additional term, multiple terms, or even a lifetime hold on power.\nOutcomes: This factor examines whether the autocoup attempt is successful or ultimately fails.\n\nThis study will primarily focus on the methods employed by incumbents to stage autocoups. However, we will also code for other relevant aspects like the degree of legality, duration of extension, and outcomes whenever information is available. This multifaceted approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the variations within autocoups.\n\n3.2.1 Evasion of term limits\nEvasion of term limits is a common tactic employed in autocoups. Incumbents often resort to seemingly legal maneuvers to extend their hold on power. These maneuvers primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through various means. The incumbents may pressure legislative bodies (congress) or judicial institutions (Supreme Court) to reinterpret existing term limits, amend the constitution to extend terms, or even replace the constitution altogether. This might also involve popular vote through referendums, or a combination of these approaches. The extension can range from a single term to indefinite rule.\nThese manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through various means.\n\nChanging Term Length: Incumbents might lengthen the official term duration (e.g., from 4 to 6 years) to stay in office longer, even if the number of allowed terms remains unchanged. Examples, in the dataset, include Presidents Dacko (CAR, 1962), Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and Pinochet (Chile, 1988).\nEnabling re-election: This approach involves incumbents modifying legal or constitutional frameworks to permit themselves to run for leadership again, despite initial restrictions. These restrictions might include prohibitions on re-election, bans on immediate re-election, or term limits that the incumbents have already reached. An illustrative example is President Menem of Argentina in 1993, who leveraged this tactic to extend his tenure.\nRemoving Term Limits Altogether: This approach, as seen with President Xi Jinping of China in 2018, technically allows the leader to rule for life, although they may still need to participate in elections (a formality in such cases).\nLeader for Life: This differs from removing term limits as the leader still faces elections (although potentially rigged or uncontested). An example is Indonesia’s President Sukarno, who attempted to declare himself president for life in 1963 (ultimately unsuccessful).\n\nThese methods are often used in combination. Initially, the duration of a term is extended, followed by amendments to allow re-election, then the removal of term limits, and finally, the declaration of the leader for life. For example, Haitian President François Duvalier amended the constitution in 1961 to permit immediate re-election and then declared himself president for life in 1964.\n\n3.2.2 Election Manipulation or Rigging\nElection manipulation or rigging is the second most commonly used tactic to extend an incumbent’s tenure.\n\nDelaying or Removing Elections: Delaying or removing scheduled elections without legitimate justification is a frequent method used by incumbents to maintain power. For instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye delayed general elections until 1969 after assuming power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos suspended elections throughout his rule from 1979 to 2017.\nRefusing Unfavourable Election Results: Incumbents may refuse to accept unfavourable election results and attempt to overturn them through illegitimate means. For example, President Donald Trump of the United States refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and tried to overturn them.\nRigging Elections: Winning elections with an extraordinarily high percentage of votes is highly questionable. This study will code elections where the incumbent wins more than 90% of the vote as autocoups. For instance, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently won elections with over 95% of the vote in multi-party elections since 1996, indicating election rigging.\nExcluding Opposition in Elections: Manipulating the electoral process by excluding opposition parties or candidates from participation, effectively creating a one-candidate race, clearly signifies an autocoup.\n\n3.2.3 Figurehead\n\nTo circumvent term limits, some incumbents might choose a close associate to act as a figurehead, taking the office publicly while the incumbent retains real power behind the scenes. This can be achieved through seemingly subordinate positions.\nOne example is Russia in 2008. Facing term limits, President Putin selected Dmitry Medvedev to run for president. After the election, Medvedev appointed Putin as Prime Minister. However, most analysts believe Putin wielded the true power throughout this period.\n\n3.2.4 Constitutional power transferring\n\nThis tactic involves an incumbent leader manipulating the constitution or legal framework to create a new position of power, or elevate an existing one, before stepping down from their current role. They then strategically take on this new position, effectively retaining significant control despite appearing to relinquish power. For example, in 2017, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Prime Minister of Turkey, spearheaded a constitutional referendum that transitioned the country from a parliamentary system to a presidential one. This new system concentrated significant executive power in the presidency. Following the referendum’s approval, Erdoğan successfully ran for the newly established presidency, effectively retaining control under a different title.\n\n3.2.5 One-Time Arrangement for Current Leaders\nThis strategy involves special arrangements that extend the term or tenure of current leaders without altering the underlying institutions. For example, Lebanon extended President Émile Lahoud’s term by three years in 2004 through a one-time arrangement.\n\n3.3 Data Coding\n\n3.3.1 Data sources\nCode# library(kableExtra)\n\nread.csv(here(\"data/autocoup_source.csv\")) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    1:4 ~ px(80),\n    5 ~ px(200)\n  ) |&gt;\n   data_color(rows = c(1, 3), colors = \"#edede9\") \n\n\nTable 1: Sources of coding autocoup dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nYears\nUnit of Research\nObervations\nAuthors\n\n\n\nArchigos\n1875-2015\nLeaders\n3409\nHein Goemans, Kristian Skrede Gleditsch, Giacomo Chiozza (2009)\n\n\nPLAD\n1989-2023\nLeaders\n1334\nPietro Bomprezzi et al.

Table 1 outlines the main sources for coding the autocoup dataset. The Archigos dataset (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009) and the Political Leaders’ Affiliation Database (PLAD) dataset (Bomprezzi et al. 2024) provide comprehensive data on all leaders from 1875 to 2023, although our coding only includes autocoups since 1945. These datasets help identify the actual rulers of countries, saving time in distinguishing real leaders from nominal heads of state.\nThe Incumbent Takeover dataset (Baturo and Tolstrup 2022), which integrates data from 11 related datasets, offers a broad spectrum of cases where leaders significantly reduce the constraints on their power, encompassing both power expansions and extensions. Since some executive takeovers do not qualify as autocoups due to the lack of term extensions, I cross-referenced the Archigos dataset, which includes detailed trajectories of leaders’ entries and exits from power, to verify the qualifications for autocoups.\n\nCodeAutocoup &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reddylee/Datasets/main/autocoup.csv\")\n# nrow(Autocoup)\n# nrow(Autocoup |&gt; filter(!is.na(baturo)))\n\n\nIn total, I coded 110 observations, with 72 overlapping with the candidate data from Incumbent Takeover. The remaining 38 events were newly coded by the author through verification with other sources such as Archigos, and news reports.The main deviation from the Incumbent Takeover dataset arises from excluding power expansions that do not involve attempts to extend tenure.\n\n3.3.2 Definitions of main variables\nThis section describes the variables included in the autocoup dataset.\n\n\nCountry Identification:\n\n\nccode and country: These variables come from the Correlates of War project (Stinnett et al. 2002) and identify the countries included in the dataset, which are widely used in political science datasets, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different studies and datasets.\n\n\n\nLeader Information:\n\n\nleader_name: This variable follows the Archigos dataset’s coding and records the name of the de facto leader who wielded power in the country.\n\n\n\nTimeline Variables:\n\nentry_date: Captures the date the leader assumed power.\nexit_date: Records the date the leader left office.\nautocoup_date: Indicates the date the autocoup is considered to have occurred. Since extensions often happen incrementally, this date reflects a significant event marking the extension, such as a legislative vote or successful referendum.\nextending_date: Represents the start date of the leader’s additional term acquired through the autocoup.\n\nThe entry_date and exit_date come from the Archigos and REIGN datasets, while the other two dates are coded by the dataset creator.\n\n\nPower Transition Methods:\n\nentry_method and exit_method: These categorical variables record how the leader entered and exited power (e.g., election, coup d’état, death).\nentry_regular and exit_regular: These dummy variables indicate whether the entry and exit methods were regular (e.g., election) or irregular (e.g., coup).\n\n\n\nAutocoup Details:\n\nautocoup_method: This key variable captures the various methods leaders use to extend their stay in power (see Section 3.2 for details).\nautocoup_outcome: This variable indicates the outcome of the autocoup attempt: “fail and lose power”, “fail but complete original tenure”, or “successful”. For successful coups, the additional term length can be calculated from the difference between exit_date and extending_date.\n\n\n\nData Source:\n\n\nsource: This variable identifies the dataset source used for coding, primarily differentiating among “Incumbent Takeovers” or other sources.\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\nnotes: This variable provides context for exceptional cases. For instance, if a leader undertook multiple autocoup attempts, details are recorded here.\n\n\n\nThe dataset encompasses a total of 14 variables along with the notes field.\n\n3.4 Data descriptions\n\nCodeautocoup &lt;- Autocoup |&gt; \n  mutate(exit_date = ifelse(exit_date != \"Incumbent\", exit_date, NA)) |&gt; \n  mutate(exit_date = case_when(is.na(exit_date) ~ Sys.Date(), \n                               .default = convert_to_date(exit_date)),\n         extending_date = make_date(year = extending_date, month(entry_date), day(entry_date))) |&gt; \n  select(1:14)\n\ncountry &lt;- autocoup |&gt; \n  distinct(ccode) |&gt; \n  summarise(count = n())\n\n\n\nCodeautocoup_desc &lt;- autocoup |&gt; \n  summarise(autocoup_attempted = n(),\n            autocoup_succeeded = sum(autocoup_outcome == \"Yes\"),\n    .by = autocoup_method) |&gt; \n  arrange(-autocoup_attempted)\nautocoup_desc |&gt; \n  adorn_totals() |&gt; \n  mutate(Success_rate = percent (autocoup_succeeded/autocoup_attempted)) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    1 ~ px(180),\n    2:3 ~ px(140),\n    4 ~ px(100)\n  )\n#autocoup_desc$autocoup_attempted[1]\n\n\nTable 2: Autocoup methods and success rates (1945-2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocoup Method\nAutocoup Attempted\nAutocoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nEnabling re-election\n46\n33\n71.74%\n\n\nRemoving term limits\n14\n14\n100.00%\n\n\nDelaying elections\n9\n9\n100.00%\n\n\nLeader for life\n9\n9\n100.00%\n\n\nChanging term length\n7\n5\n71.43%\n\n\nFigurehead\n6\n5\n83.33%\n\n\nOne-time arrangement\n5\n4\n80.00%\n\n\nRefusing election results\n4\n1\n25.00%\n\n\nReassigning power role\n4\n2\n50.00%\n\n\nRigging elections\n3\n2\n66.67%\n\n\nCancelling elections\n3\n3\n100.00%\n\n\nTotal\n110\n87\n79.09%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to our primary coding, we have identified 110 autocoup cases from 1945 to 2022, involving 73 countries. As shown in Table 2, the most common autocoup method is enabling re-election, accounting for 46 events. This is followed by removing term limits altogether, with 14 cases, and then delaying elections and declaring the leader for life, each with 9 cases.\nExamining the success rates of autocoups, the total success rate is 79%, which is significantly higher than the roughly 50% success rate of classical coups. This suggests that incumbents are in an advantageous position to expand or extend their powers as executive leaders. They can do so openly and gradually, whereas coup plotters must operate in secrecy and face numerous challenges such as promissory issues and the risk of betrayal or exposure.\nHowever, the success rates vary significantly across different methods. Removing term limits, delaying elections, declaring the leader for life, and cancelling elections are all 100% successful. In contrast, there are only 4 cases of refusing election results, with just one succeeding. Although this sample is small, it suggests that in regimes where general elections are held and incumbents lose, the system is relatively more democratic. In such cases, incumbents must run for office without the ability to rig elections, making it less likely for them to overturn election results."

    "section": "\n4 Determinants of Autocoup Attempts: Case Studies",
    "text": "4 Determinants of Autocoup Attempts: Case Studies\n\n4.1 High Frequency and Success Rate of Autocoups in Post-Communist Countries\nFrom the dataset, we observe that in post-communist countries, both the frequency and success rate of autocoups are notably high. Post-communist countries refer to those that were communist regimes before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while most of them developed into ‘hybrid regimes’ (Nurumov and Vashchanka 2019) and only a few remain communist regimes after the collapse. In these countries, there are 12 documented cases of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency, with only 2 of these attempts failing. Examining the cases in post-communist countries, several characteristics stand out:\n\nInherited Authoritarian Systems: Although most of these countries transitioned from communist regimes to non-communist governments (with the exception of China), they inherited the authoritarian systems of their communist past.\nContinuity of Former Elites: The transitions did not result in the removal or overthrow of the previous ruling groups. Instead, the former communist elites remained in power.\nSubverted Democratic Processes: Despite the introduction of general elections and term limits in most of these countries, the legacy of the former communist regimes often led to term limits being ignored and elections being rigged (Nurumov and Vashchanka 2019).\n\nFor example, Alexander Lukashenko was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After the dissolution, he became head of the interim anti-corruption committee of the Supreme Council of Belarus. Elected as the first president of Belarus in 1994, he has held the office ever since. Initially, the 1994 constitution set a maximum of two successive presidential terms, but Lukashenko removed this limit in 2004. Furthermore, international monitors have not regarded Belarusian elections as free and fair, except for his initial win. Despite significant protests against him, Lukashenko claimed to win with a high vote share, often exceeding 80% in each election. This pattern is evident in all five Central Asian countries of the former Soviet Union. Similarly, the post-dissolution leaders of these countries were high officials or heads of the former Soviet republics who continued their leadership in the presidency.\nAnother long-ruling example is Nursultan Nazarbayev, who was the first president of Kazakhstan from 1991 until 2019. He had been the real leader as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After independence, he was elected as the first president and held the office until 2019, through various means like resetting the term limits due to the implementation of new constitutions. However, he did not officially eliminate the term limits but made an exemption for the First President, Nazarbayev (Nurumov and Vashchanka 2019). Unlike Lukashenko, who is still the incumbent of Belarus, Nazarbayev passed the presidency to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, a specially designated successor, in 2019. However, he retained significant influence as the Chairman of the Security Council of Kazakhstan until 2022.\n\nCodelibrary(countrycode)\nlatin &lt;- codelist |&gt; \n  filter(region == \"Latin America & Caribbean\") |&gt; \n  select(region, cown) |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt; \n  pull(cown)\nafrica &lt;- codelist |&gt; \n  filter(continent == \"Africa\") |&gt; \n  select(continent, cown) |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt; \n  pull(cown)\n\n# autocoup |&gt; \n#   filter(ccode %in% latin) |&gt; \n#   summarise(count = n(),\n#             .by = country) |&gt; \n#   adorn_totals() \n# autocoup |&gt; \n#   filter(ccode %in% latin) |&gt; \n#   summarise(count = n(),\n#             .by = autocoup_method) |&gt; \n#   adorn_totals()\n# autocoup |&gt; \n#   filter(ccode %in% latin) |&gt; \n#   summarise(count = n(),\n#             .by = autocoup_outcome) |&gt; \n#   adorn_totals() \n\n\n\n4.2 Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin American countries\nLatin America has a long history of maintaining term limit conventions. Simón Bolívar, the founding father of Bolivia, was a strong advocate for term limits, stating in 1819, “Nothing is as dangerous as allowing the same citizen to remain in power for a long time… That’s the origin of usurpation and tyranny” (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019). Although Bolívar eventually changed his stance, arguing in his 1826 Constitution Assembly speech that “a president for life with the right to choose the successor is the most sublime inspiration for the republican order,” term limits became a convention in Latin America. Approximately 81% of Latin American constitutions between independence and 1985 imposed some form of term limits on the presidency (Marsteintredet 2019).\nReviewing the cases in Latin American countries, we notice that:\n\nStriving for Re-election: Non-re-election or non-immediate re-election has been common in Latin America, unlike other presidential countries where two terms are more popular. Autocoup leaders in Latin America often attempt to overstay a consecutive term.\nResisting long extensions: Autocoups for one more term are often successful, while attempts to overstay beyond this are frequently unsuccessful.\n\nAccording to Marsteintredet (2019), non-consecutive re-election was mandated in about 64.9% of all constitutions between independence and 1985, while 5.9% banned re-election entirely. However, adherence to these conventions has varied across the region. Since Mexico introduced non-re-election institutions in 1911 at the start of the Mexican Revolution, they have never been violated since then (Klesner 2019). Panama, along with Uruguay, has never changed the rules of re-election, and since Costa Rica prohibited immediate presidential re-election in 1859, the country has only experienced a brief period between 1897 and 1913 in which the incumbent president could be re-elected (Marsteintredet 2019). In many other countries, however, constitutions have been frequently amended or violated. The pursuit of re-election or consecutive re-election has been a significant trigger for autocoups aimed at power extension in Latin American countries. There are 32 documented autocoup cases, with over 50% (17 cases) attempting to enable re-election.\nUnlike those who attempt to overstay in office indefinitely, many Latin American leaders exit after their second term expires. Examples include President Menem of Argentina (1988-1999), President Fernando Cardoso of Brazil (1995-2003), President Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic (2012-2020), and President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras (2014-2022) (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019; Marsteintredet 2019; Landau, Roznai, and Dixon 2019; Baturo 2019; Neto and Acácio 2019). This does not mean none of them tried to extend even longer, but most did not manipulate the process by abusing their power and accepted their unsuccessful outcomes soon.\nFor instance, President Menem of Argentina successfully extended one term by amending the constitution in 1994 to allow one executive re-election and was re-elected in 1995. However, when he attempted to reset his term, arguing that his first term from 1988 to 1995 did not count since it was under previous constitutions, his appeal was unanimously ruled out by the Supreme Court in March 1999 (Llanos 2019). A similar scenario occurred with President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia (2002-2010) (Baturo 2019). In contrast, Daniel Ortega, the incumbent president of Nicaragua, successfully extended his presidency. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua allowed his re-running in 2011. In 2014, the National Assembly of Nicaragua approved constitutional amendments that abolished term limits for the presidency, allowing Ortega to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms, making him president since 2007 (Close 2019).\n\n4.3 As common as classical coups: Cases of African countries\nClassical coups have been very common in Africa, accounting for about 45% of all coups (219 out of 491) globally since 1950, involving 45 out of 54 African countries (Powell and Thyne 2011). Autocoups, although less common compared to coups, still have a significant presence in Africa. Among 113 documented autocoup cases, 46% (52 cases) occurred in Africa, involving 36 countries. The success rate of coups in Africa is roughly 50%, while the success rate of autocoups is about 83%, which is higher than both the success rate of coups and the average global success rate of autocoups, approximately 78%.\nIdentifying a clear pattern of autocoups in Africa is challenging, similar to the case with coups. Various factors have been proposed:\n\nNatural Resources: Countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil or diamonds, may see leaders more likely to attempt and succeed in extending their terms (Posner and Young, n.d.; Cheeseman 2015; Cheeseman and Klaas 2019).\nQuality of Democracy: The quality of democracy is a critical factor influencing respect for term limits (Reyntjens 2016).\nInternational Influence: International aid or donor influence can play a significant role in discouraging attempts at power extension (Brown 2001; Tangri and Mwenda 2010).\nOrganized Opposition and Party Unity: The extent of organized opposition and the president’s ability to enforce unity within the ruling party are crucial factors (Cheeseman 2019).\n\nUsing the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, Cassani (2020) highlights human rights abuses and the desire for impunity as main drivers for incumbents to cling to power. The more authoritarian a leader, the more likely they are to attempt to break term limits and overstay in office. Additionally, a leader’s ability to secure the loyalty of the armed forces through public investment increases the chances of success in overstaying.\nDespite both coups and autocoups being prevalent, there has been a noticeable shift since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Coups have decreased, while autocoups have increased. This trend is partly due to the introduction of multi-party elections in Africa in the 1990s, which also brought in term limits for executives (Cassani 2020; Cheeseman 2019). Before 1991, personal or military rule was more common, and term limits were less frequent. Post-1991, with more term limits introduced, challenges to these limits have increased. However, this does not imply that violations are more common than adherence to term limits."

    "text": "5 Empirical Analysis: A Simple Example of Utilizing the Autocoup Dataset\nWith the availability of the autocoup dataset, we can conduct quantitative analyses beyond traditional case studies. This chapter provides a simple example of demonstrating how to utilize the dataset. To analyse the determinants of autocoup attempts, we employ a probit regression model. This model is appropriate for binary dependent variables, allowing us to estimate the probability of an autocoup attempt given the independent variables.\n\n5.1 Data and Variables\n\n5.1.1 Dependent Variable\n\n\nAutocoup Attempts: This binary variable indicates whether an autocoup was attempted during the tenure of an incumbent leader, based on the data introduced in this study.\nAutocoup Success: This binary variable indicates whether an attempted autocoup of the incumbent leader succeeded, based on the data introduced in this study.\n\n5.1.2 Independent Variables\n\n\n\nEconomic Performance: This variable is measured using two indicators: economic level and economic growth trend.\nEconomic Level: Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a country.\nEconomic Growth Trend: Assessed using the current-trend (CT) ratio, developed by Krishnarajan (2019). The CT ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher CT ratio signifies stronger economic performance.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe GDP per capita data, expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP) and measured in units of $10,000, is sourced from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022). To account for the economic impact of the previous year, this data is lagged by one year.\n\nPolitical Stability: This variable captures overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall. This index provides a comprehensive measure of the level of violence and conflict within a country, which can significantly impact power transitions. (Marshall 2005).\nDegree of Democracy: The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5 scores at the entry year for each respective country. These scores range from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), capturing the extent of democratic versus autocratic governance. This dataset is sourced from the Centre for Systemic Peace (CSP)1 and provides an essential measure of political regime type, which might influence the political stability and power transitions.\nPopulation Size: To account for its potential impact on leaders’ tenures, the log of the population size is considered. This transformation helps in managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its influence on power transitions. Larger populations may present more governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting the stability and longevity of a leader’s tenure.\nLeader’s Age: The age of the leader is included as an additional variable in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with leadership strength. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks, and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain power. This data is sourced from the leaders dataset by (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\n\nDifferent from analysing the determinants of coups, which theoretically could happen in each year, we assume that autocoup happens only once during the tenure of the incumbent. Because once the incumbent succeeds an autocoup, there is no necessary to stage another one. Of course, this is not the case in real time. A leader who successfully overstayed one term could try to overstay additional term, or even strive for leadership for life. A leader who failed in the first attempt might make another try if they are not removed due the first failure. To simplify the analysis, we overlook those possibilities.\nTherefore, in the probit model, the unit of analysis in autocoups is the whole tenure of the leader, not country-year. So, we need to settle a base-year for the variables. For leaders who staged an autocoup, we take the year of their first attempts as the base-year, while for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, we take the middle year of their tenure as the base-year.\nUnlike the analysis of coup determinants, which could theoretically occur in any given year, we assume that an autocoup happens only once during an incumbent leader’s tenure. Once an incumbent succeeds in staging an autocoup, there is no need for another attempt. However, this assumption does not always reflect reality. A leader who successfully extends their term might attempt further extensions, striving for lifelong leadership. Conversely, a leader who fails in their first attempt may try again if they are not removed from power after the initial failure. For simplicity, we overlook these possibilities in our analysis.\nTherefore, in our probit model, the unit of analysis for autocoups is the entire tenure of a leader, rather than a country-year. We establish a base year for the variables: for leaders who staged an autocoup, we use the year of their first attempt as the base year; for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, we use the middle year of their tenure as the base year.\n\n5.2 Results and discussions\nCodeautocoup_final_data &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/Autocoup_model_data.csv\"))\n\nmodel_attempt &lt;- autocoup_final_data |&gt; \n  mutate(regime = fct_relevel(regime, \"presidential\")) |&gt;\n  glm(autocoup_attempt ~ regime + GDP_pc + GDP_trend + polity5 + violence + age + pop_log, \n      family = binomial(link = \"probit\"),\n      data = _)\n\nmodel_success &lt;- autocoup_final_data |&gt; \n  mutate(regime = fct_relevel(regime, \"presidential\")) |&gt;\n  filter(autocoup_attempt == 1) |&gt; \n  glm(autocoup_success ~ regime + GDP_pc + GDP_trend + polity5 + violence + age + pop_log, \n      family = binomial(link = \"probit\"),\n      data = _)\n\nstargazer(model_attempt, model_success, \n          header = F,\n          column.labels = c(\"Coup Attempts\", \"Coup Outcome\"),\n          intercept.bottom = F,\n          title = \"Determinants of autocoup attempts and success (1945-2018)\",\n          label = \"results\",\n          covariate.labels = c(\"Constant\",\n                               \"Regime: Dominant-party\",\n                               \"\\\\hspace{1.6cm}Military\",\n                               \"\\\\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist\",\n                               \" GDP per capita\",\n                               \"Economic trend\",\n                               \"Political 5\",\n                               \"Political violence\",\n                               \"Age\",\n                               \"Population(log)\"),\n          dep.var.caption = \"\",\n          dep.var.labels.include = F,\n          summary.logical = T,\n          column.sep.width = \"50pt\"\n          )\nTable \\(\\ref{results}\\) summarizes the findings from the probit regression models based on our analysis of the determinants of autocoup attempts and their success.\nModel 1, which examines autocoup attempts, reveals only one significant predictor besides the constant term. Among the regime types, personalist regimes significantly increase the likelihood of autocoup attempts, all else being equal. This suggests that leaders in personalist regimes are more prone to attempt to extend their power through autocoups compared to leaders in democratic regimes. Leaders in dominant-party and military regimes, however, show no significant difference in the likelihood of attempting an autocoup compared to democratic leaders.\nThe model for autocoup success (Model 2) shows similar dynamics. Personalist regimes again have a strong positive and significant effect on the success of autocoups compared to democratic leaders. Dominant-party regimes also show a positive and marginally significant effect. However, a detailed examination reveals that about half of the successful autocoups in dominant-party regimes (9 out of 20) exhibit a personalist style, such as “party-personal-military” regimes.\nThis is logical since personalist leaders are typically much more powerful than other types of leaders, making them more inclined and capable of overstaying in power.\nOther factors play an insignificant role in determining the attempts and outcomes of autocoups. This aligns with our conclusions on the determinants of classic coups. Both coups and autocoups are significantly affected by power dynamics. As power transitions involve the struggle between seizing and maintaining power, the balance of power status quo inevitably matters in both coups and autocoups. This also explains the high success rate of autocoups. Compared to power challengers, incumbents are in an obviously advantageous position. Incumbent leaders can use state power to their benefit, which is difficult to counteract. Even the abuse of power is often unchecked under a powerful leader’s rule.\nThe threshold for removing or impeaching an incumbent leader is very high. Without more than a majority or even greater support, it is very difficult to succeed. Using illegal means such as a coup is even more challenging, as the costs are high, the consequences are severe, and the likelihood of success is very low."

    "text": "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of autocoups, specifically focusing on political events where incumbent leaders illegitimately extend their tenure in power. By refining the concept and distinguishing it from broader definitions, such as ‘self-coups’, ‘autogolpes’, ‘executive takeover’, we introduce a novel dataset of autocoups (1945-2022). Through this more precise definition and dataset, we enhance the understanding and methods of analyzing the dynamics of irregular power transitions and the survival of political leaders.\nOur findings reveal that personalist regimes are far more likely to experience autocoup attempts and are more likely to succeed compared to democracies. Dominant-party systems, often exhibiting personalist characteristics, also show an association with successful autocoups. While regime type significantly influences autocoups, other factors appear less impactful, mirroring classic coups where the balance of power is a more essential determinant. The high success rate of autocoups can be attributed to the inherent advantages incumbents possess, such as control over or abuse of state power and the difficulty of removing or impeaching them through legal or illegal means.\nHowever, there are several limitations that future research could address. Firstly, the definition of an autocoup requires further commentary and discussion to gain wider acceptance. Accordingly, the dataset of autocoups requires further case-by-case verification to improve accuracy, although debates on some ambiguous cases will likely persist. Secondly, due to the nature of autocoups, which are less frequent than classic coups (491 coups versus 110 autocoups during the same period), the quantitative analysis cannot be conducted as a country-year variable as in coups. This raises the issue of choosing a base year. For example, when analyzing how GDP level or growth rate, the democratic index (such as Polity 5), or the age of the leader affect autocoup attempts, we need to decide which year’s value should be used. In this study, we chose the middle year of a leader’s tenure or the year they staged the autocoup, but determining the most appropriate year requires further discussion.\nDespite these limitations, this research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind autocoups, contributing to the literature on political stability and democratic resilience. Future studies could build on this work by employing the dataset to explore more power dynamics or examine the long-term impacts of these events on political systems, particularly on democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, and personalization of power."

    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe study of irregular power transitions, encompassing both irregular entries and exits from office, has long been a central topic in political science. However, one form of irregular power transition - the incumbent leader’s refusal to relinquish power - remains relatively understudied. This scenario, where leaders overstay their mandated term limits for one or more terms, or even indefinitely, lacks a universally accepted term in the existing literature. To address this gap, this study adopts the term “autocoup” to denote this phenomenon.\nCoups, being the primary form of irregular power transitions, have received significant scholarly attention. Research by Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009) indicate that coups account for a substantial portion of such transitions, with roughly two-thirds (65.8%) of 374 irregular exits occurring through coups. Additionally, Frantz and Stein (2016) demonstrate that coups are the most common form of exit in autocracies, surpassing regular transitions by a third.\nHowever, while coups were once frequent, recent decades have witnessed a decline in their occurrence (Bermeo 2016; Thyne and Powell 2019). Conversely, autocoups appear to be on the rise, particularly since the Cold War’s end (Ginsburg, Melton, and Elkins 2010; Baturo 2014; Versteeg et al. 2020). Despite the significant political impact and rising prevalence of autocoups, their study lags behind that of classical coups, which are extensively documented due to their historical frequency (Thyne and Powell 2019).\nThis research aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the understudied phenomenon of autocoups as they are at least equally important and warrant comprehensive analysis. Firstly, autocoups are typically accompanied by a disregard for the rule of law, weakened institutions, and potential democratic backsliding or authoritarian personalization. Secondly, like traditional coups, successful autocoups increase the risk of future irregular power transitions. Research indicates that since 1945, approximately 62 percent of leaders who overstayed their term limits through autocoups in non-democratic countries were either ousted or assassinated while in office (Baturo 2019). Thirdly, failed autocoups often trigger instability that fuels protests, violence, and even civil wars.\nDespite their significance, autocoups are understudied compared to traditional coups. Although several relevant concepts and terminologies such as self-coups, autocoups, autogolpes, incumbent takeovers, executive aggrandizement, overstay, and continuismo have been proposed and discussed (Marsteintredet and Malamud 2019; Baturo and Tolstrup 2022), there is no clear and widely accepted term to describe these events. Different terms are often used interchangeably or inconsistently, leading to confusion. Moreover, due to the lack of clear concepts, the collection of autocoup datasets is still in its early stages compared to the rich datasets of traditional coups. Hence, the limited existing studies on autocoups have primarily relied on case studies (Maxwell A. Cameron 1998b; Antonio 2021; Pion-Berlin, Bruneau, and Goetze 2022), with few focusing on quantitative analyses.\nTo fully understand irregular political leadership transitions and survival, we need to redefine and clarify the term “autocoup” first. Based on a clear definition, we can introduce an autocoup dataset that can be used for further empirical analysis. This study aims to address these knowledge gap surrounding autocoups and contribute in three areas. First, it clarifies the terminology by defining autocoups based mainly on power extension. Second, it introduces a new dataset of autocoups since 1945 based on this refined definition. Finally, the research utilizes this dataset for a quantitative analysis of the factors that influence leaders’ decisions to attempt autocoups.\nThe subsequent section, based on a comprehensive review of the definitions of power expansions and power extensions, proposes a precise definition of autocoups. This will be followed by an introduction to the new autocoup dataset in Part III. In Parts IV and V, I will explain the determinants of autocoup attempts through two case studies and demonstrate how the novel autocoup dataset collected in this study can be used in empirical analysis. Finally, I will conclude in Part VI, summarizing the key insights gained from the study and suggesting avenues for future research."

    "section": "\n2 Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions",
    "text": "2 Autocoups: A literature review and clarification of definitions\nCompared to coups, which are clearly defined and widely accepted as illegal attempts by elites within the ruling group to overthrow the leadership (Powell and Thyne 2011), the concept of autocoups (also known as self-coups or autogolpes) suffers from a lack of consistency and clarity. This ambiguity hinders our understanding and study of a critical phenomenon in irregular power transitions. To address this gap, we need to tackle two key issues: terminology and definition.\n\n2.1 Terminology\nThe most common term in autocoup literature is self-coup, or autogolpe in Spanish (Przeworski et al. 2000; Maxwell A. Cameron 1998a; Bermeo 2016; Helmke 2017; Marsteintredet and Malamud 2019). This term gained academic prominence after Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress, temporarily suspended the constitution, and ruled by decree in 1992 (Mauceri 1995; Maxwell A. Cameron 1998b). However, as Marsteintredet and Malamud (2019) point out, the term “self-coup” can be misleading, as it implies a coup against oneself, which is inaccurate since it is not self-directed but targets other state institutions or apparatus.\nAnother approach to describe coups staged by incumbents is to use terms with adjectives or modifiers, such as presidential coup, executive coup, constitutional coup, electoral coup, judicial coup, slow-motion coup, soft coup, and parliamentary coup (Marsteintredet and Malamud 2019). While these terms can be helpful in specific contexts, their proliferation often adds to the overall confusion rather than providing clarification. Most of these terms focus on the specific methods used by coup perpetrators but fail to clearly identify the perpetrator, necessitating further explanation. In fact, many of these methods could be employed either by or against executive leaders.\nA third alternative involves terms like “incumbent takeover” or “overstay”. Incumbent takeover referrs to “an event perpetuated by a ruling executive that significantly reduces the formal and/or informal constraints on his/her power” (Baturo and Tolstrup 2022, 374), based on earlier research (Svolik 2014). While overstay is defined as “staying longer than the maximum term as it stood when the candidate originally came in office” (Ginsburg, Melton, and Elkins 2011, 1844). These terms identify the perpetrator (the incumbent) and/or the nature of the event (overstaying/extending power). However, they do not highlight the illegality or illegitimacy of these actions. Therefore, they cannot serve as a direct counterpart to “coup,” which clearly denotes the illegality of leadership ousters, while “takeover” or “overstay” diminish the severity.\nTherefore, this study strongly advocates for “autocoup” as the most accurate and appropriate term. It avoids the pitfalls of other terms by clearly conveying the essence of the phenomenon as a coup-like power grab and effectively distinguishing autocoups from classical coups by highlighting the perpetrator.\n\n2.2 Definition\nWhile terminology is important, another issue arises with the previous definition of autocoups: should we emphasize power expansion or power extension? Power Expansion refers to situations where an executive branch expands its power beyond its original boundaries, often by encroaching on the authority of other branches like the legislature or judiciary. Power Extension, on the other hand, refers to situations where a leader extends their tenure in office beyond the originally mandated term limits. Existing definitions of self-coup or autocoup sometimes touch upon power extensions, but they primarily focus on power expansions, which has several drawbacks.\nFirstly, defining autocoups primarily in terms of power expansion does not align well with the definition of a coup. When we define a classical coup, the focus is clearly on the ouster of the current leader, not merely a limitation or restriction on their power. Using the same logic, a more appropriate definition of an autocoup should prioritize the extension of executive leadership. We would not classify an event as a coup if a vice president seizes some power from the president, as long as the president remains in office. Similarly, an executive leader acquiring more power from other branches should not automatically qualify as an autocoup if their term limits remain unchanged.\nSecondly, emphasizing power expansion raises issues regarding the purpose of launching an autocoup. As Maxwell A. Cameron (1998a) defined, a self-coup is “a temporary suspension of the constitution and dissolution of congress by the executive, who rules by decree until new legislative elections and a referendum can be held to ratify a political system with broader executive power” (Maxwell A. Cameron 1998a, 220). However, without extending their time in office, the leader faces significant risks once their term expires, as they could face legal or political repercussions for the autocoup itself, leaving behind an overly powerful executive branch for the successor. Although the term “self-coup” gained prominence from the 1992 Fujimori case in Peru, which initially involved seizing power from other institutions, it is important to note that Fujimori ultimately extended his term limits through constitutional amendments. The 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, which he won with popularity in April 1995. Shortly after Fujimori began his second term, his supporters in Congress passed a law of “authentic interpretation” which effectively allowed him to run for another term in 2000, which he won amid suspicions and rumors. However, he did not survive the third term. In 2000, facing charges of corruption and human rights abuses, Fujimori fled Peru and took refuge in Japan (Ezrow 2019).\nThirdly, measuring the extent of power expansion to qualify as an autocoup can be challenging. Power expansion might occur as a sudden, significant event, as seen with Fujimori in 1992, or it could be gradual and incremental, as in the case of Putin since assuming power in 1999 (Chaisty 2019). In the latter case, it is unclear whether each step should be considered an autocoup or if the entire process together should be labelled as such. If the latter, determining the point at which it becomes an autocoup is again problematic.\nTherefore, this study argues that a more accurate definition of autocoups should prioritize power extension as the core characteristic.\nIn light of this discussion, we formally define an autocoup as the practice of current political leaders extending their time in office beyond their originally mandated term limits. Three key points need to be highlighted for this definition. Firstly, this definition refers to the actual leaders of the country, regardless of their official titles. Typically, this would be the president; however, in some cases, such as in Germany, the primary leader is the premier, as the president is a nominal head of state. Secondly, while the primary characteristic of an autocoup is extending the term in office, this definition does not exclude instances of power expansion. Both aspects can coexist, but the extension of the term is the central element. Thirdly, autocoups, by their nature, subvert legal norms and established power transfer mechanisms. While they may employ seemingly legal tactics, their essence is illegitimacy. This critical aspect will be explored further in Chapter III."

    "section": "\n3 Autocoup dataset",
    "text": "3 Autocoup dataset\n\n3.1 Defining the scope\nDefining any concept or term inevitably involves borderline cases that are difficult to categorize. In the context of autocoups, it is particularly challenging to determine whether a specific instance of overstaying should be coded as an autocoup. To avoid ambiguity and dilemmas, we will code all instances of incumbents extending their original mandated term in office as autocoups, regardless of whether the extension is patently illegal or superficially legal.\nThis approach is taken because a truly legitimate amendment to power transition institutions should only apply to subsequent leaders, not the incumbent. If the incumbent changes the rules to their own benefit, the legitimacy of such changes is questionable, even if the amendment procedures appear legal. We have valid reasons to question their motivations since they are the beneficiaries of these reforms.\nEven so, some cases remain unclear. For example, consider a two-term limit presidency where the leader wins a second term. Allegations of election rigging might surface, raising suspicions about the fairness of the election results. If such suspicions can be verified with evidence or judicial verdict, the case would undoubtedly be coded as an autocoup. However, proving election rigging in countries with powerful executives can be difficult. In such instances, we will not classify it as an autocoup unless a formal judicial verdict confirms the rigging.\nEven in contexts where leaders lack clear term limits or the constitution allows indefinite terms, identifying autocoups remains possible. We will discuss and explain this in the next section.\n\n3.2 Classifying autocoups\n\nAutocoups can manifest in various forms. To understand this phenomenon better, we can categorize them based on several key factors:\n\nMethods Employed: This refers to the specific strategies incumbents use to extend their hold on power. Examples include constitution amending or reinterpreting, election cancelling, delaying or rigging.\nDegree of Legality: This dimension captures the extent to which an autocoup deviates from established legal norms. It can range from minor rule-bending to outright constitutional violations.\nDuration of Extension: This category focuses on the length of time the incumbent leader remains in office beyond their designated term limits. It could be a single additional term, multiple terms, or even a lifetime hold on power.\nOutcomes: This factor examines whether the autocoup attempt is successful or ultimately fails.\n\nThis study will primarily focus on the methods employed by incumbents to stage autocoups. However, we will also code for other relevant aspects like the degree of legality, duration of extension, and outcomes whenever information is available. This multifaceted approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the variations within autocoups.\n\n3.2.1 Evasion of term limits\nEvasion of term limits is a common tactic employed in autocoups. Incumbents often resort to seemingly legal maneuvers to extend their hold on power. These maneuvers primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through various means. The incumbents may pressure legislative bodies (congress) or judicial institutions (Supreme Court) to reinterpret existing term limits, amend the constitution to extend terms, or even replace the constitution altogether. This might also involve popular vote through referendums, or a combination of these approaches. The extension can range from a single term to indefinite rule.\nThese manoeuvres primarily involve manipulating constitutional provisions through various means.\n\nChanging Term Length: Incumbents might lengthen the official term duration (e.g., from 4 to 6 years) to stay in office longer, even if the number of allowed terms remains unchanged. Examples, in the dataset, include Presidents Dacko (CAR, 1962), Kayibanda (Rwanda, 1973), and Pinochet (Chile, 1988).\nEnabling re-election: This approach involves incumbents modifying legal or constitutional frameworks to permit themselves to run for leadership again, despite initial restrictions. These restrictions might include prohibitions on re-election, bans on immediate re-election, or term limits that the incumbents have already reached. An illustrative example is President Menem of Argentina in 1993, who leveraged this tactic to extend his tenure.\nRemoving Term Limits Altogether: This approach, as seen with President Xi Jinping of China in 2018, technically allows the leader to rule for life, although they may still need to participate in elections (a formality in such cases).\nLeader for Life: This differs from removing term limits as the leader still faces elections (although potentially rigged or uncontested). An example is Indonesia’s President Sukarno, who attempted to declare himself president for life in 1963 (ultimately unsuccessful).\n\nThese methods are often used in combination. Initially, the duration of a term is extended, followed by amendments to allow re-election, then the removal of term limits, and finally, the declaration of the leader for life. For example, Haitian President François Duvalier amended the constitution in 1961 to permit immediate re-election and then declared himself president for life in 1964.\n\n3.2.2 Election Manipulation or Rigging\nElection manipulation or rigging is the second most commonly used tactic to extend an incumbent’s tenure.\n\nDelaying or Removing Elections: Delaying or removing scheduled elections without legitimate justification is a frequent method used by incumbents to maintain power. For instance, Chadian President François Tombalbaye delayed general elections until 1969 after assuming power in 1960. Similarly, Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos suspended elections throughout his rule from 1979 to 2017.\nRefusing Unfavourable Election Results: Incumbents may refuse to accept unfavourable election results and attempt to overturn them through illegitimate means. For example, President Donald Trump of the United States refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and tried to overturn them.\nRigging Elections: Winning elections with an extraordinarily high percentage of votes is highly questionable. This study will code elections where the incumbent wins more than 90% of the vote as autocoups. For instance, President Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea has consistently won elections with over 95% of the vote in multi-party elections since 1996, indicating election rigging.\nExcluding Opposition in Elections: Manipulating the electoral process by excluding opposition parties or candidates from participation, effectively creating a one-candidate race, clearly signifies an autocoup.\n\n\n3.2.3 Figurehead\n\nTo circumvent term limits, some incumbents might choose a close associate to act as a figurehead, taking the office publicly while the incumbent retains real power behind the scenes. This can be achieved through seemingly subordinate positions.\nOne example is Russia in 2008. Facing term limits, President Putin selected Dmitry Medvedev to run for president. After the election, Medvedev appointed Putin as Prime Minister. However, most analysts believe Putin wielded the true power throughout this period.\n\n3.2.4 Constitutional power transferring\n\nThis tactic involves an incumbent leader manipulating the constitution or legal framework to create a new position of power, or elevate an existing one, before stepping down from their current role. They then strategically take on this new position, effectively retaining significant control despite appearing to relinquish power. For example, in 2017, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Prime Minister of Turkey, spearheaded a constitutional referendum that transitioned the country from a parliamentary system to a presidential one. This new system concentrated significant executive power in the presidency. Following the referendum’s approval, Erdoğan successfully ran for the newly established presidency, effectively retaining control under a different title.\n\n3.2.5 One-Time Arrangement for Current Leaders\nThis strategy involves special arrangements that extend the term or tenure of current leaders without altering the underlying institutions. For example, Lebanon extended President Émile Lahoud’s term by three years in 2004 through a one-time arrangement.\n\n3.3 Data Coding\n\n3.3.1 Data sources\nCode# library(kableExtra)\n\nread.csv(here(\"data/autocoup_source.csv\")) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    1:4 ~ px(80),\n    5 ~ px(200)\n  ) |&gt;\n   data_color(rows = c(1, 3), colors = \"#edede9\") \n\n\nTable 1: Sources of coding autocoup dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nYears\nUnit of Research\nObervations\nAuthors\n\n\n\nArchigos\n1875-2015\nLeaders\n3409\nHein Goemans, Kristian Skrede Gleditsch, Giacomo Chiozza (2009)\n\n\nPLAD\n1989-2023\nLeaders\n1334\nPietro Bomprezzi et al. (2024)\n\n\nIncumbent Takeover\n1913-2019\nIncumbent takeovers\n279\nAlexander Baturo, Jakob Tolstrup (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autocoup dataset, like most dataset coding procedures, is based on existing studies and datasets. Table 1 outlines the main sources for coding the autocoup dataset. The Archigos dataset (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009) and the Political Leaders’ Affiliation Database (PLAD) dataset (Bomprezzi et al. 2024) provide comprehensive data on all leaders from 1875 to 2023, although our coding only includes autocoups since 1945. These datasets help identify the actual rulers of countries, saving time in distinguishing real leaders from nominal heads of state.\nThe Incumbent Takeover dataset (Baturo and Tolstrup 2022), which integrates data from 11 related datasets, offers a broad spectrum of cases where leaders significantly reduce the constraints on their power, encompassing both power expansions and extensions. Since some executive takeovers do not qualify as autocoups due to the lack of term extensions, I cross-referenced the Archigos dataset, which includes detailed trajectories of leaders’ entries and exits from power, to verify the qualifications for autocoups.\n\nCodeAutocoup &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reddylee/Datasets/main/autocoup.csv\")\n# nrow(Autocoup)\n# nrow(Autocoup |&gt; filter(!is.na(baturo)))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, I coded 110 observations, with 72 overlapping with the candidate data from Incumbent Takeover. The remaining 38 events were newly coded by the author through verification with other sources such as Archigos, and news reports.The main deviation from the Incumbent Takeover dataset arises from excluding power expansions that do not involve attempts to extend tenure.\n\n3.3.2 Definitions of main variables\nThis section describes the variables included in the autocoup dataset.\n\n\nCountry Identification:\n\n\nccode and country: These variables come from the Correlates of War project (Stinnett et al. 2002) and identify the countries included in the dataset, which are widely used in political science datasets, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different studies and datasets.\n\n\n\nLeader Information:\n\n\nleader_name: This variable follows the Archigos dataset’s coding and records the name of the de facto leader who wielded power in the country.\n\n\n\nTimeline Variables:\n\nentry_date: Captures the date the leader assumed power.\nexit_date: Records the date the leader left office.\nautocoup_date: Indicates the date the autocoup is considered to have occurred. Since extensions often happen incrementally, this date reflects a significant event marking the extension, such as a legislative vote or successful referendum.\nextending_date: Represents the start date of the leader’s additional term acquired through the autocoup.\n\nThe entry_date and exit_date come from the Archigos and REIGN datasets, while the other two dates are coded by the dataset creator.\n\n\nPower Transition Methods:\n\nentry_method and exit_method: These categorical variables record how the leader entered and exited power (e.g., election, coup d’état, death).\nentry_regular and exit_regular: These dummy variables indicate whether the entry and exit methods were regular (e.g., election) or irregular (e.g., coup).\n\n\n\nAutocoup Details:\n\nautocoup_method: This key variable captures the various methods leaders use to extend their stay in power (see Section 3.2 for details).\nautocoup_outcome: This variable indicates the outcome of the autocoup attempt: “fail and lose power”, “fail but complete original tenure”, or “successful”. For successful coups, the additional term length can be calculated from the difference between exit_date and extending_date.\n\n\n\nData Source:\n\n\nsource: This variable identifies the dataset source used for coding, primarily differentiating among “Incumbent Takeovers” or other sources.\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n\nnotes: This variable provides context for exceptional cases. For instance, if a leader undertook multiple autocoup attempts, details are recorded here.\n\n\n\nThe dataset encompasses a total of 14 variables along with the notes field.\n\n3.4 Data descriptions\n\nCodeautocoup &lt;- Autocoup |&gt; \n  mutate(exit_date = ifelse(exit_date != \"Incumbent\", exit_date, NA)) |&gt; \n  mutate(exit_date = case_when(is.na(exit_date) ~ Sys.Date(), \n                               .default = convert_to_date(exit_date)),\n         extending_date = make_date(year = extending_date, month(entry_date), day(entry_date))) |&gt; \n  select(1:14)\n\ncountry &lt;- autocoup |&gt; \n  distinct(ccode) |&gt; \n  summarise(count = n())\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeautocoup_desc &lt;- autocoup |&gt; \n  summarise(autocoup_attempted = n(),\n            autocoup_succeeded = sum(autocoup_outcome == \"Yes\"),\n    .by = autocoup_method) |&gt; \n  arrange(-autocoup_attempted)\nautocoup_desc |&gt; \n  adorn_totals() |&gt; \n  mutate(Success_rate = percent (autocoup_succeeded/autocoup_attempted)) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    1 ~ px(180),\n    2:3 ~ px(140),\n    4 ~ px(100)\n  )\n#autocoup_desc$autocoup_attempted[1]\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Autocoup methods and success rates (1945-2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocoup Method\nAutocoup Attempted\nAutocoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nEnabling re-election\n46\n33\n71.74%\n\n\nRemoving term limits\n14\n14\n100.00%\n\n\nDelaying elections\n9\n9\n100.00%\n\n\nLeader for life\n9\n9\n100.00%\n\n\nChanging term length\n7\n5\n71.43%\n\n\nFigurehead\n6\n5\n83.33%\n\n\nOne-time arrangement\n5\n4\n80.00%\n\n\nRefusing election results\n4\n1\n25.00%\n\n\nReassigning power role\n4\n2\n50.00%\n\n\nRigging elections\n3\n2\n66.67%\n\n\nCancelling elections\n3\n3\n100.00%\n\n\nTotal\n110\n87\n79.09%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to our primary coding, we have identified 110 autocoup cases from 1945 to 2022, involving 73 countries. As shown in Table 2, the most common autocoup method is enabling re-election, accounting for 46 events. This is followed by removing term limits altogether, with 14 cases, and then delaying elections and declaring the leader for life, each with 9 cases.\nExamining the success rates of autocoups, the total success rate is 79%, which is significantly higher than the roughly 50% success rate of classical coups. This suggests that incumbents are in an advantageous position to expand or extend their powers as executive leaders. They can do so openly and gradually, whereas coup plotters must operate in secrecy and face numerous challenges such as promissory issues and the risk of betrayal or exposure.\nHowever, the success rates vary significantly across different methods. Removing term limits, delaying elections, declaring the leader for life, and cancelling elections are all 100% successful. In contrast, there are only 4 cases of refusing election results, with just one succeeding. Although this sample is small, it suggests that in regimes where general elections are held and incumbents lose, the system is relatively more democratic. In such cases, incumbents must run for office without the ability to rig elections, making it less likely for them to overturn election results."

    "text": "4 Determinants of Autocoup Attempts: Case Studies\n\n4.1 High Frequency and Success Rate of Autocoups in Post-Communist Countries\nFrom the dataset, we observe that in post-communist countries, both the frequency and success rate of autocoups are notably high. Post-communist countries refer to those that were communist regimes before the collapse of the Soviet Union, while most of them developed into ‘hybrid regimes’ (Nurumov and Vashchanka 2019) and only a few remain communist regimes after the collapse. In these countries, there are 12 documented cases of autocoups aimed at prolonging incumbency, with only 2 of these attempts failing. Examining the cases in post-communist countries, several characteristics stand out:\n\nInherited Authoritarian Systems: Although most of these countries transitioned from communist regimes to non-communist governments (with the exception of China), they inherited the authoritarian systems of their communist past.\nContinuity of Former Elites: The transitions did not result in the removal or overthrow of the previous ruling groups. Instead, the former communist elites remained in power.\nSubverted Democratic Processes: Despite the introduction of general elections and term limits in most of these countries, the legacy of the former communist regimes often led to term limits being ignored and elections being rigged (Nurumov and Vashchanka 2019).\n\nFor example, Alexander Lukashenko was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After the dissolution, he became head of the interim anti-corruption committee of the Supreme Council of Belarus. Elected as the first president of Belarus in 1994, he has held the office ever since. Initially, the 1994 constitution set a maximum of two successive presidential terms, but Lukashenko removed this limit in 2004. Furthermore, international monitors have not regarded Belarusian elections as free and fair, except for his initial win. Despite significant protests against him, Lukashenko claimed to win with a high vote share, often exceeding 80% in each election. This pattern is evident in all five Central Asian countries of the former Soviet Union. Similarly, the post-dissolution leaders of these countries were high officials or heads of the former Soviet republics who continued their leadership in the presidency.\nAnother long-ruling example is Nursultan Nazarbayev, who was the first president of Kazakhstan from 1991 until 2019. He had been the real leader as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After independence, he was elected as the first president and held the office until 2019, through various means like resetting the term limits due to the implementation of new constitutions. However, he did not officially eliminate the term limits but made an exemption for the First President, Nazarbayev (Nurumov and Vashchanka 2019). Unlike Lukashenko, who is still the incumbent of Belarus, Nazarbayev passed the presidency to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, a specially designated successor, in 2019. However, he retained significant influence as the Chairman of the Security Council of Kazakhstan until 2022.\n\nCodelibrary(countrycode)\nlatin &lt;- codelist |&gt; \n  filter(region == \"Latin America & Caribbean\") |&gt; \n  select(region, cown) |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt; \n  pull(cown)\nafrica &lt;- codelist |&gt; \n  filter(continent == \"Africa\") |&gt; \n  select(continent, cown) |&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt; \n  pull(cown)\n\n# autocoup |&gt; \n#   filter(ccode %in% latin) |&gt; \n#   summarise(count = n(),\n#             .by = country) |&gt; \n#   adorn_totals() \n# autocoup |&gt; \n#   filter(ccode %in% latin) |&gt; \n#   summarise(count = n(),\n#             .by = autocoup_method) |&gt; \n#   adorn_totals()\n# autocoup |&gt; \n#   filter(ccode %in% latin) |&gt; \n#   summarise(count = n(),\n#             .by = autocoup_outcome) |&gt; \n#   adorn_totals() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Autocoups for immediate re-election: Cases of Latin American countries\nLatin America has a long history of maintaining term limit conventions. Simón Bolívar, the founding father of Bolivia, was a strong advocate for term limits, stating in 1819, “Nothing is as dangerous as allowing the same citizen to remain in power for a long time… That’s the origin of usurpation and tyranny” (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019). Although Bolívar eventually changed his stance, arguing in his 1826 Constitution Assembly speech that “a president for life with the right to choose the successor is the most sublime inspiration for the republican order,” term limits became a convention in Latin America. Approximately 81% of Latin American constitutions between independence and 1985 imposed some form of term limits on the presidency (Marsteintredet 2019).\nReviewing the cases in Latin American countries, we notice that:\n\nStriving for Re-election: Non-re-election or non-immediate re-election has been common in Latin America, unlike other presidential countries where two terms are more popular. Autocoup leaders in Latin America often attempt to overstay a consecutive term.\nResisting long extensions: Autocoups for one more term are often successful, while attempts to overstay beyond this are frequently unsuccessful.\n\nAccording to Marsteintredet (2019), non-consecutive re-election was mandated in about 64.9% of all constitutions between independence and 1985, while 5.9% banned re-election entirely. However, adherence to these conventions has varied across the region. Since Mexico introduced non-re-election institutions in 1911 at the start of the Mexican Revolution, they have never been violated since then (Klesner 2019). Panama, along with Uruguay, has never changed the rules of re-election, and since Costa Rica prohibited immediate presidential re-election in 1859, the country has only experienced a brief period between 1897 and 1913 in which the incumbent president could be re-elected (Marsteintredet 2019). In many other countries, however, constitutions have been frequently amended or violated. The pursuit of re-election or consecutive re-election has been a significant trigger for autocoups aimed at power extension in Latin American countries. There are 32 documented autocoup cases, with over 50% (17 cases) attempting to enable re-election.\nUnlike those who attempt to overstay in office indefinitely, many Latin American leaders exit after their second term expires. Examples include President Menem of Argentina (1988-1999), President Fernando Cardoso of Brazil (1995-2003), President Danilo Medina of the Dominican Republic (2012-2020), and President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras (2014-2022) (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019; Marsteintredet 2019; Landau, Roznai, and Dixon 2019; Baturo 2019; Neto and Acácio 2019). This does not mean none of them tried to extend even longer, but most did not manipulate the process by abusing their power and accepted their unsuccessful outcomes soon.\nFor instance, President Menem of Argentina successfully extended one term by amending the constitution in 1994 to allow one executive re-election and was re-elected in 1995. However, when he attempted to reset his term, arguing that his first term from 1988 to 1995 did not count since it was under previous constitutions, his appeal was unanimously ruled out by the Supreme Court in March 1999 (Llanos 2019). A similar scenario occurred with President Álvaro Uribe of Colombia (2002-2010) (Baturo 2019). In contrast, Daniel Ortega, the incumbent president of Nicaragua, successfully extended his presidency. In 2009, the Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua allowed his re-running in 2011. In 2014, the National Assembly of Nicaragua approved constitutional amendments that abolished term limits for the presidency, allowing Ortega to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms, making him president since 2007 (Close 2019).\n\n4.3 As common as classical coups: Cases of African countries\nClassical coups have been very common in Africa, accounting for about 45% of all coups (219 out of 491) globally since 1950, involving 45 out of 54 African countries (Powell and Thyne 2011). Autocoups, although less common compared to coups, still have a significant presence in Africa. Among 113 documented autocoup cases, 46% (52 cases) occurred in Africa, involving 36 countries. The success rate of coups in Africa is roughly 50%, while the success rate of autocoups is about 83%, which is higher than both the success rate of coups and the average global success rate of autocoups, approximately 78%.\nIdentifying a clear pattern of autocoups in Africa is challenging, similar to the case with coups. Various factors have been proposed:\n\nNatural Resources: Countries rich in natural resources, particularly oil or diamonds, may see leaders more likely to attempt and succeed in extending their terms (Posner and Young, n.d.; Cheeseman 2015; Cheeseman and Klaas 2019).\nQuality of Democracy: The quality of democracy is a critical factor influencing respect for term limits (Reyntjens 2016).\nInternational Influence: International aid or donor influence can play a significant role in discouraging attempts at power extension (Brown 2001; Tangri and Mwenda 2010).\nOrganized Opposition and Party Unity: The extent of organized opposition and the president’s ability to enforce unity within the ruling party are crucial factors (Cheeseman 2019).\n\nUsing the Africa Executive Term Limits (AETL) dataset, Cassani (2020) highlights human rights abuses and the desire for impunity as main drivers for incumbents to cling to power. The more authoritarian a leader, the more likely they are to attempt to break term limits and overstay in office. Additionally, a leader’s ability to secure the loyalty of the armed forces through public investment increases the chances of success in overstaying.\nDespite both coups and autocoups being prevalent, there has been a noticeable shift since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Coups have decreased, while autocoups have increased. This trend is partly due to the introduction of multi-party elections in Africa in the 1990s, which also brought in term limits for executives (Cassani 2020; Cheeseman 2019). Before 1991, personal or military rule was more common, and term limits were less frequent. Post-1991, with more term limits introduced, challenges to these limits have increased. However, this does not imply that violations are more common than adherence to term limits."

    "text": "5 Empirical Analysis: A Simple Example of Utilizing the Autocoup Dataset\nWith the availability of the autocoup dataset, we can conduct quantitative analyses beyond traditional case studies. This chapter provides a simple example of demonstrating how to utilize the dataset. To analyse the determinants of autocoup attempts, we employ a probit regression model. This model is appropriate for binary dependent variables, allowing us to estimate the probability of an autocoup attempt given the independent variables.\n\n5.1 Data and Variables\n\n5.1.1 Dependent Variable\n\n\nAutocoup Attempts: This binary variable indicates whether an autocoup was attempted during the tenure of an incumbent leader, based on the data introduced in this study.\nAutocoup Success: This binary variable indicates whether an attempted autocoup of the incumbent leader succeeded, based on the data introduced in this study.\n\n\n5.1.2 Independent Variables\n\n\n\nEconomic Performance: This variable is measured using two indicators: economic level and economic growth trend.\nEconomic Level: Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a country.\nEconomic Growth Trend: Assessed using the current-trend (CT) ratio, developed by Krishnarajan (2019). The CT ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher CT ratio signifies stronger economic performance.\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe GDP per capita data, expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP) and measured in units of $10,000, is sourced from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022). To account for the economic impact of the previous year, this data is lagged by one year.\n\nPolitical Stability: This variable captures overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall. This index provides a comprehensive measure of the level of violence and conflict within a country, which can significantly impact power transitions. (Marshall 2005).\nDegree of Democracy: The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5 scores at the entry year for each respective country. These scores range from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), capturing the extent of democratic versus autocratic governance. This dataset is sourced from the Centre for Systemic Peace (CSP)1 and provides an essential measure of political regime type, which might influence the political stability and power transitions.\nPopulation Size: To account for its potential impact on leaders’ tenures, the log of the population size is considered. This transformation helps in managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its influence on power transitions. Larger populations may present more governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting the stability and longevity of a leader’s tenure.\nLeader’s Age: The age of the leader is included as an additional variable in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with leadership strength. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks, and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain power. This data is sourced from the leaders dataset by (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\n\nDifferent from analysing the determinants of coups, which theoretically could happen in each year, we assume that autocoup happens only once during the tenure of the incumbent. Because once the incumbent succeeds an autocoup, there is no necessary to stage another one. Of course, this is not the case in real time. A leader who successfully overstayed one term could try to overstay additional term, or even strive for leadership for life. A leader who failed in the first attempt might make another try if they are not removed due the first failure. To simplify the analysis, we overlook those possibilities.\nTherefore, in the probit model, the unit of analysis in autocoups is the whole tenure of the leader, not country-year. So, we need to settle a base-year for the variables. For leaders who staged an autocoup, we take the year of their first attempts as the base-year, while for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, we take the middle year of their tenure as the base-year.\nUnlike the analysis of coup determinants, which could theoretically occur in any given year, we assume that an autocoup happens only once during an incumbent leader’s tenure. Once an incumbent succeeds in staging an autocoup, there is no need for another attempt. However, this assumption does not always reflect reality. A leader who successfully extends their term might attempt further extensions, striving for lifelong leadership. Conversely, a leader who fails in their first attempt may try again if they are not removed from power after the initial failure. For simplicity, we overlook these possibilities in our analysis.\nTherefore, in our probit model, the unit of analysis for autocoups is the entire tenure of a leader, rather than a country-year. We establish a base year for the variables: for leaders who staged an autocoup, we use the year of their first attempt as the base year; for leaders who did not attempt to overstay, we use the middle year of their tenure as the base year.\n\n5.2 Results and discussions\nCodeautocoup_final_data &lt;- read_csv(here(\"data/Autocoup_model_data.csv\"))\n\nmodel_attempt &lt;- autocoup_final_data |&gt; \n  mutate(regime = fct_relevel(regime, \"presidential\")) |&gt;\n  glm(autocoup_attempt ~ regime + GDP_pc + GDP_trend + polity5 + violence + age + pop_log, \n      family = binomial(link = \"probit\"),\n      data = _)\n\nmodel_success &lt;- autocoup_final_data |&gt; \n  mutate(regime = fct_relevel(regime, \"presidential\")) |&gt;\n  filter(autocoup_attempt == 1) |&gt; \n  glm(autocoup_success ~ regime + GDP_pc + GDP_trend + polity5 + violence + age + pop_log, \n      family = binomial(link = \"probit\"),\n      data = _)\n\nstargazer(model_attempt, model_success, \n          header = F,\n          column.labels = c(\"Coup Attempts\", \"Coup Outcome\"),\n          intercept.bottom = F,\n          title = \"Determinants of autocoup attempts and success (1945-2018)\",\n          label = \"results\",\n          covariate.labels = c(\"Constant\",\n                               \"Regime: Dominant-party\",\n                               \"\\\\hspace{1.6cm}Military\",\n                               \"\\\\hspace{1.6cm}Personalist\",\n                               \" GDP per capita\",\n                               \"Economic trend\",\n                               \"Political 5\",\n                               \"Political violence\",\n                               \"Age\",\n                               \"Population(log)\"),\n          dep.var.caption = \"\",\n          dep.var.labels.include = F,\n          summary.logical = T,\n          column.sep.width = \"50pt\"\n          )\nTable \\(\\ref{results}\\) summarizes the findings from the probit regression models based on our analysis of the determinants of autocoup attempts and their success.\nModel 1, which examines autocoup attempts, reveals only one significant predictor besides the constant term. Among the regime types, personalist regimes significantly increase the likelihood of autocoup attempts, all else being equal. This suggests that leaders in personalist regimes are more prone to attempt to extend their power through autocoups compared to leaders in democratic regimes. Leaders in dominant-party and military regimes, however, show no significant difference in the likelihood of attempting an autocoup compared to democratic leaders.\nThe model for autocoup success (Model 2) shows similar dynamics. Personalist regimes again have a strong positive and significant effect on the success of autocoups compared to democratic leaders. Dominant-party regimes also show a positive and marginally significant effect. However, a detailed examination reveals that about half of the successful autocoups in dominant-party regimes (9 out of 20) exhibit a personalist style, such as “party-personal-military” regimes.\nThis is logical since personalist leaders are typically much more powerful than other types of leaders, making them more inclined and capable of overstaying in power.\nOther factors play an insignificant role in determining the attempts and outcomes of autocoups. This aligns with our conclusions on the determinants of classic coups. Both coups and autocoups are significantly affected by power dynamics. As power transitions involve the struggle between seizing and maintaining power, the balance of power status quo inevitably matters in both coups and autocoups. This also explains the high success rate of autocoups. Compared to power challengers, incumbents are in an obviously advantageous position. Incumbent leaders can use state power to their benefit, which is difficult to counteract. Even the abuse of power is often unchecked under a powerful leader’s rule.\nThe threshold for removing or impeaching an incumbent leader is very high. Without more than a majority or even greater support, it is very difficult to succeed. Using illegal means such as a coup is even more challenging, as the costs are high, the consequences are severe, and the likelihood of success is very low.\nCenter for Systemic Peace: https://www.systemicpeace.org.

    "section": "\n6 Conclusion",
    "text": "6 Conclusion\nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of autocoups, specifically focusing on political events where incumbent leaders illegitimately extend their tenure in power. By refining the concept and distinguishing it from broader definitions, such as ‘self-coups’, ‘autogolpes’, ‘executive takeover’, we introduce a novel dataset of autocoups (1945-2022). Through this more precise definition and dataset, we enhance the understanding and methods of analyzing the dynamics of irregular power transitions and the survival of political leaders.\nOur findings reveal that personalist regimes are far more likely to experience autocoup attempts and are more likely to succeed compared to democracies. Dominant-party systems, often exhibiting personalist characteristics, also show an association with successful autocoups. While regime type significantly influences autocoups, other factors appear less impactful, mirroring classic coups where the balance of power is a more essential determinant. The high success rate of autocoups can be attributed to the inherent advantages incumbents possess, such as control over or abuse of state power and the difficulty of removing or impeaching them through legal or illegal means.\nHowever, there are several limitations that future research could address. Firstly, the definition of an autocoup requires further commentary and discussion to gain wider acceptance. Accordingly, the dataset of autocoups requires further case-by-case verification to improve accuracy, although debates on some ambiguous cases will likely persist. Secondly, due to the nature of autocoups, which are less frequent than classic coups (491 coups versus 110 autocoups during the same period), the quantitative analysis cannot be conducted as a country-year variable as in coups. This raises the issue of choosing a base year. For example, when analyzing how GDP level or growth rate, the democratic index (such as Polity 5), or the age of the leader affect autocoup attempts, we need to decide which year’s value should be used. In this study, we chose the middle year of a leader’s tenure or the year they staged the autocoup, but determining the most appropriate year requires further discussion.\nDespite these limitations, this research enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind autocoups, contributing to the literature on political stability and democratic resilience. Future studies could build on this work by employing the dataset to explore more power dynamics or examine the long-term impacts of these events on political systems, particularly on democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, and personalization of power.\n\n\n\n\nCan.Do.So\n\n\n\n\nAntonio, Robert J. 2021. “Democracy and Capitalism in the Interregnum: Trump’s Failed Self-Coup and After.” Critical Sociology 48 (6): 937–65. https://doi.org/10.1177/08969205211049499.\n\n\nBaturo, Alexander. 2014. “Democracy, Dictatorship, and Term Limits.” https://doi.org/10.3998/mpub.4772634.\n\n\n———. 2019. “Continuismo in Comparison.” In, 75–100.

    "section": "\n2 Literature review",
    "text": "2 Literature review\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science research for decades. This enduring interest arises from the wide-ranging variations observed across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Previous studies have identified two crucial yet interconnected aspects of political survival: regime survival and individual leader survival.\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as monarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader survival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual leaders’ time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns. For example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific political parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders (Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see long-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a more frequent pace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some military regimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party or junta and the leader of the country. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of individual leader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how long leaders remain in power.\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a wealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific mechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as democracies (Svolik 2014) or autocracies (Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood 2021). Others seek to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks that can explain leader survival across diverse political systems (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). While the development of a universal theory remains an alluring goal, it is important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in creating a single model that encompasses the complexities of leadership survival across all regime types.\nThe mechanisms governing power transitions vary significantly across different regimes, particularly between democracies and autocracies. In many autocratic systems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential candidates are often restricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families, military elites, or members of the ruling party. While political competition and elections may exist in some autocracies, there are often significant barriers to entry for legitimate challengers. Potential rivals may face threats such as assassination, imprisonment, or exile. Moreover, selection processes are shrouded in secrecy, with outsiders unable to participate or obtain information on the selections, let alone express dissent or complain about the results. This lack of inclusivity and transparency makes it challenging to gauge true levels of public support compared to democracies. Consequently, calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as explored by Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003), becomes a near-impossible task in autocracies.\nTherefore, focusing research on more specific regimes or types of leaders may be more appropriate. While regular and anticipated leadership changes are important as well, they offer less fertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader longevity, as the vast majority of leaders who assume power through established channels also exit power through established mechanisms (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009). In contrast, the study of political survival among irregular leaders is particularly captivating due to the intricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular leadership transitions.\nThe diverse mechanisms influencing political leadership survival, as discussed above, have prompted scholars to delve deeper into more specific determinants. Two primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.\nThe first perspective considers objective factors and resources available to leaders. These include elements such as personal competence (Yu and Jong-A-Pin 2016), societal stability (Arriola 2009), economic development (Palmer and Whitten 1999; Williams 2011), access to natural resources (Smith 2004; Quiroz Flores and Smith 2012; Wright, Frantz, and Geddes 2013), or external support networks (Licht 2009; Wright 2008; Thyne et al. 2017).\nThe second perspective explores subjective factors, focusing on the strategies leaders employ to consolidate their power. This encompasses both the formulation and implementation of political policies and the leaders’ responses to opposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions (Gandhi and Przeworski 2007; Morrison 2009; Escribà-Folch 2013; Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood 2021).\nUnsurprisingly, coups have garnered significant scholarly attention due to their pivotal role in removing leaders (Svolik 2009; Frantz and Stein 2016). Existing research delves into strategies for thwarting coups (J. Powell 2017; Sudduth 2017; De Bruin 2020), as well as how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup attempts (Easton and Siverson 2018). For instance, Sudduth (2017) examines the post-coup actions of dictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders initially wield more power than elites within the regime, rendering them less susceptible to subsequent coups, challenging the conventional view of new leaders as inherently weak (Roessler 2011). Meanwhile, Sudduth and Bell (2018) investigates how leaders’ entry methods affect their removal in dictatorships, positing that irregular entry does not necessarily increase the likelihood of removal; in fact, some forms of irregular entry may offer protection.\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts, including universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed challenges, a significant gap persists. There is a lack of research specifically exploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their reigns through autocoups compared to coup-entry leaders. This study aims to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership survival between these two distinct leader types."

    "section": "\n3 Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-entry leaders",
    "text": "3 Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-entry leaders\n\n3.1 Autocoup leaders versus coup-entry leaders\nAs emphasized in Chapter 2, delving into leadership survival poses inherent challenges, given factors such as the opacity and diverse mechanisms of power transitions. However, these challenges underscore the significance of this research, as it sheds light on understudied dynamics.\nWhile the survival of political leaders manifests complexity and variation, it is not devoid of patterns entirely. Leaders of similar types often exhibit significant comparability. Before delving into the comparison, it is necessary to clarify several relative terminologies.\nFirstly, we define an autocoup as a situation where an incumbent leader utilizes illegitimate or unconstitutional methods to extend their tenure and remain in power. An autocoup is deemed successful if this power extension lasts for at least six months. Coups, on the other hand, are defined as illegal and overt attempts by the military or other powerful groups within the state to unseat the sitting leader (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011). Similar to coups, successful autocoups in this study will be measured by a power usurpation lasting at least six months, differing from the seven-day duration coded by Powell and Thyne.\nSecondly, it is also crucial to clarify the distinction between an autocoup leader and a coup-entry leader, as the survival of leadership is the main concern of this study.\n\nAutocoup leader: This refers to an incumbent leader who successfully uses illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. In an autocoup, the leader orchestrates the power grab and continues to rule afterwards.\nCoup-entry leader: This term designates the individual who assumes power after a successful coup. The coup leader and the coup-entry leader may or may not be the same person. Unlike in autocoups, coups often involve multiple leaders (individuals or groups) who overthrow the incumbent leader, but typically only one of them assumes supreme power. In some instances, coup leaders may support someone outside the coup plot to become the new leader. For example, military officers might return power to civilians after a coup or support a new general election. Regardless of the specific scenario, a coup-entry leader in this study refers to the individual who assumes formal leadership following a successful coup.\n\nGiven that autocoup leaders typically exhibit longer overall tenures compared to coup-entry leaders, this study focuses on a more nuanced comparison. Specifically, we will analyse the post-autocoup tenure of autocoup leaders and contrast it with the post-coup tenure of coup-entry leaders. The examination of the survival tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders is motivated by their relevance and similarity in terms of illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability.\n\n3.2 Hypothesis\nPrevious research emphasizes that skilful power retention is the ultimate determinant of leader longevity. Leaders who can maintain control or manipulate the balance of power tend to stay in office longer. However, as discussed earlier, although both coup-entry and autocoup leaders face similar challenges, the intensity of their challenges related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability differs. These discrepancies create an uneven playing field in terms of power dynamics, with coup-entry leaders at a significant disadvantage. This disparity in power equilibrium shapes a nuanced landscape that profoundly impacts the duration of leader tenures.\n\n3.2.1 Illegitimacy\nBoth leader types lack legitimacy, though it manifests differently. Coup leaders seize power through force or the threat of force, making their illegitimacy explicit. Autocoups often employ seemingly legal procedures, but these processes are frequently manipulated by incumbents leveraging their control (Zhu 2024). This perception of illegitimacy can be used to justify the removal of autocoup and coup-entry leaders, even if the means of removal are themselves illegitimate.\nWhile both coup-entry and autocoup leaders lack genuine legitimacy, the nature of this illegitimacy differs significantly. Coups represent a more blatant disregard for legal processes, often involving force or the threat of force to seize power. In contrast, autocoups employ a façade of legality through tactics such as manipulating constitutional interpretations, engineering parliamentary votes, influencing court decisions, and even holding referendums. Despite this veneer, these manoeuvres do not erase the underlying lack of genuine legitimacy, hence this study categorizes them as autocoups. However, there is considerable debate among scholars, with some arguing for less severe terms like “incumbent overstay” or “executive takeover” due to the perceived legality.\nThis perceived legitimacy can provide a temporary advantage for autocoup leaders. Challengers are often constrained to operate within legal frameworks, making it difficult to directly confront the incumbent.\n\n3.2.2 Uncertainty\nThe tumultuous paths to power undertaken by coup-initiators and autocratic leaders cast a shadow of uncertainty over their reigns and eventual departure. Their ascension through irregular means undermines established power transition norms, leaving doubts lingering over their commitment to constitutional succession protocols. This uncertainty not only unsettles elites and citizens but also plagues the leaders themselves, who grapple with the perpetual ambiguity surrounding the transfer of power – when, how, and to whom. Historical analyses underscore this predicament, with data revealing that more than two-thirds of irregular exits from leadership stem from coup-related upheavals (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders face different levels of uncertainty immediately following their rise to or overstay power.\nAfter a coup, at least three major uncertainties arise regarding leadership and its tenure. First, it is unclear who will assume leadership. Although coup leaders often take power, some may return or promise to return power to civilian leaders. Even among coup leaders, determining who will lead can be problematic, as coup plotters are sometimes a group without a clear core leader. For instance, following the 1973 Chilean coup, the initial plan for a rotating presidency among military leaders was abandoned when General Pinochet consolidated control and remained in power until 1990 (Svolik 2014). Second, the duration of the coup leader’s rule is uncertain. Leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt (1954 coup), Muammar Gaddafi in Libya (1969 coup), and Idi Amin in Uganda (1971 coup) aimed to retain power for life (Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2018), but their ability to do so was uncertain. Others promise to transfer power to civilian authorities, but the timing and fulfillment of these promises are unclear. For example, Myanmar’s military junta (2021 coup) has repeatedly extended a state of emergency, clinging to power beyond the promised time-frame1. Conversely, after the 2010 coup in Niger, the military honoured their promise by restoring civilian rule within the same year (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019). Third, the successors of coup leaders are uncertain. Some may designate successors from their inner circle, including family members, while others may support general elections, though whether this will be fulfilled as intended remains uncertain.\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders present a clearer picture regarding leadership and tenure. There is no ambiguity about who will rule after an autocoup. In the medium term, autocoup leaders typically hold office themselves. Many, like Putin in Russia and Xi Jinping in China, seek to extend their rule indefinitely and are unlikely to relinquish power voluntarily. Others attempt to extend their terms incrementally, such as President Menem of Argentina, who overstayed until 1993 but failed in his bid for another term in 1999 (Llanos 2019).\n\n3.2.3 Instability\nMoreover, the awareness of their shaky legitimacy and the persistent uncertainty breeds insecurity and a perpetual sense of crisis among coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. In a bid to solidify their grip on power, they often resort to reshaping power dynamics or purging potential adversaries. Paradoxically, these attempts to bolster stability and fortify their rule frequently boomerang, unleashing even greater turmoil and instability.\nThe stability of a regime, particularly in an autocracy, hinges on maintaining a balance of power. Coups, however, inevitably disrupt this balance, even when they are bloodless, necessitating the creation of a new equilibrium. The ousting of previous rulers requires dismantling the established governing structure and reshuffling high-ranking officials, actions that inherently generate instability and create adversaries for the new leadership. This makes restoring order and establishing a balanced power structure notably challenging. Studies show that new leaders often purge rival elite groups to consolidate their power at the outset of their tenure (Sudduth 2017; Roessler 2011). Such actions can provoke backlash even from close allies. For instance, in Uganda, President Obote’s attempt to undermine the army commander-in-chief, Idi Amin, led to Amin gaining the army’s support and ultimately ousting Obote in a 1971 coup. Similarly, in Pakistan in 1999, shortly after Prime Minister Sharif dismissed powerful army chief General Pervez Musharraf, Sharif himself was ousted in a coup orchestrated by Musharraf and his supporters (Sudduth 2017).\nTo consolidate power, coup-entry leaders often have to compromise with internal or external power challengers. However, these compromises are frequently unstable and easily broken. The situation becomes even more complex when there is a risk of civil war. Leaders may attempt to reduce the likelihood of subsequent coups, potentially increasing the chances of societal rebellions and civil wars (Roessler 2011).\nMoreover, instability extends beyond leadership to policies. A new leadership group often brings new policies, and coups are sometimes triggered by disagreements over significant policies. Major policy shifts can instigate dissent or grievances from various ruling factions, communities, regions, ethnicities, or religions.\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders encounter far fewer of these issues, as their regimes experience fewer abrupt changes. They face less pressure to dismantle the existing ruling paradigm and establish a new order. Even when adjustments are necessary, they have more time to implement changes gradually.\nCode# library(kableExtra)\nread.csv(here(\"data/leader_comparison.csv\")) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    1 ~ px(100),\n    2:3 ~ px(250)\n  ) |&gt;\n   data_color(rows = c(2, 4), colors = \"#edede9\") \n\n\nTable 1: Main features of autocoup and coup-entry leaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nAutocoup Leader\nCoup Entry Leader\n\n\n\nIllegitimacy\nNormally attained through lawful procedures, but lacking consensus legitimacy\nBlatantly illegal\n\n\nUncertainty\nInitially with some certainty, but decreases as the leader's age grows or health worsens\nSignificant uncertainty initially\n\n\nInstability\nRelatively stable\nUnstable except when a strongman emerges or constitutional institutions are established\n\n\nBalance of Power\nGenerally in a better position of power\nInitially unclear and challenging to establish a balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, coup-entry leaders face a significantly greater degree of the challenges discussed earlier, placing them at a substantial disadvantage in the power dynamic compared to autocoup leaders. This disadvantage creates a self-perpetuating cycle. Weaker leaders struggle to attract and retain strong support, making them more vulnerable to internal and external challenges. The perception of risk discourages potential allies, further eroding their power base.\nEmpirical evidence bolsters this dynamic. Data reveals a correlation between the frequency of coup attempts in a country and the likelihood of future coups (e.g., Table 2 shows over a third of coups occurring in the top ten countries with the most attempts since 1950). This suggests that the more coups occur in a country, the more likely additional coups are to happen in the future.\n\nCodecoup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/powell_thyne_coups_final.txt\",\n                 sep = \"\\t\")\n\ncoups &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Coup attempted` = n(),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coup == 2),\n    .by = country\n  )\n\ncoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt;\n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`,\n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;\n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts (1950–2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversely, autocoup leaders, often benefiting from a veneer of legitimacy and a stronger initial position, are better able to consolidate power and attract supporters. This advantage can be self-reinforcing, as a strong power base discourages challenges and fosters loyalty. This dynamic is evident in cases like China (2018), where the National People’s Congress granted Xi Jinping the potential to rule for life2, and Russia (2020), where constitutional changes allow Putin to potentially remain in power until 20363.\nThese features and the balance of power contribute to a shorter expected tenure for coup-entry leaders compared to the relatively longer tenures of autocoup leaders. The average survival period following an autocoup is approximately five years longer than that of coup-entry leaders (Figure 1). Based on these observations and discussions, I propose the following hypothesis:\n\nH1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups are more likely to experience longer leadership survival compared to coup-entry leaders.\n\nIn the subsequent section, I will outline the research methodology used in this paper. I will introduce several control variables to determine if the hypothesis remains persistent and robust."

    "section": "\n4 Research Design",
    "text": "4 Research Design\n\n4.1 Methodology: Survival analysis\nTo test the hypothesis, I will employ two Cox models to analyse the survival tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. Unlike the Kaplan-Meier model, the Cox model enables the estimation of the impacts of multiple factors. Although it does not directly estimate the duration of tenure in office, it evaluates the hazard rate associated with being ousted from power. Essentially, this represents different facets of the same phenomenon: as a leader’s cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their probability of survival in office decreases.\nThe first model will utilize the Cox proportional hazards model (referred to as the Cox PH model), where I will only use the variables present at the entry year, without considering the changes in these variables over the leaders’ survival times.\nHowever, apart from the primary variable of interest in this research—the leader type—control variables such as economic performance, Polity5 scores, and political stability do change over time. Therefore, the second model will account for these variations by using the time-dependent Cox model.\n\n4.2 Data\nThe main variables are as follows.\n\n4.2.1 Dependent variables\n\nSurvival Time: The duration of a leader’s tenure, measured in days. For coup-entry leaders, the survival time begins on the day they assume power through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time starts on the expiration date of their original legitimate term. For example, Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013 and removed term limits in 2018. His original legitimate tenure was set to end in 2023, so his survival time begins in 2023, not 2013 or 2018, marking the start of his post-autocoup tenure. The survival time concludes on the day the leader exits office, applicable to both coup-entry and autocoup leaders.\n\nEnd point status: This variable indicates the manner in which the leader’s tenure concluded, categorized as follows:\n\n0 = Censored: This status is assigned to leaders who leave office through means other than being ousted. This includes leaders who appoint their successors, opt for democratic transitions, or leave office due to health issues or natural death.\n1 = Ousted: This status is assigned to leaders who are forced out of office. This includes cases where leaders “voluntarily” resign under pressure, reflecting a de facto ousting by force.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Key Independent variable: Leader type\nThis variable categorizes leaders into two distinct groups:\n\nGroup A = Autocoup Leader: Leaders who extend their tenure through autocoups.\nGroup B = Coup-Entry Leader: Leaders who assume power through coups.This variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the basis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.\n\nThe data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from Zhu (2024) and Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009).\n\n4.2.3 Control variables\n\n\nEconomic Performance: This variable is measured using two indicators: economic level and economic growth rate.\n\nEconomic Level: Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a country.\nEconomic Growth Trend: Assessed using the current-trend (CT) ratio, developed by Krishnarajan (2019). The CT ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher CT ratio signifies stronger economic performance.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe GDP per capita data, expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP) and measured in units of $10,000, is sourced from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022). To account for the economic impact of the previous year, this data is lagged by one year.\n\nPolitical Stability: This variable captures overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall. This index provides a comprehensive measure of the level of violence and conflict within a country, which can significantly impact leadership survival. (Marshall 2005).\nDegree of Democracy: The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5 scores at the entry year for each respective country. These scores range from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), capturing the extent of democratic versus autocratic governance. This dataset is sourced from the Center for Systemic Peace (CSP)4 and provides an essential measure of political regime type, which can influence the stability and survival of leaders in power.\nPopulation Size: To account for its potential impact on leaders’ tenures, the log of the population size is considered. This transformation helps in managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its influence on leadership survival. Larger populations may present more governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting the stability and longevity of a leader’s tenure.\nLeader’s Age: The age of the leader at the entry year is included as an additional variable in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with leadership survival. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks, and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain power. This data is sourced from the leaders dataset by (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\n\nBased on the methods and variables, we have the model as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSurv(survival\\_time, status) &= Group + \\\\\n&GDP\\_growth\\_trend + GDP\\_per\\_capita + \\\\\n&pop\\_log + polity5 + Stability + age\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]"

Coup-entry leaders were found to have a hazard ratio of 2.42 (in time-dependent Cox model) compared to autocoup leaders (reference group), assuming all other variables in the model are held constant. The analysis suggests that coup-entry leaders face a significantly greater risk of removal from power compared to autocoup leaders. At any given time during their tenure, coup-entry leaders are 2.42 times more likely to be ousted from power compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal in the model.\nAll other control variables in Cox PH model are not statistically significant. In time-dependent Cox model, however, GDP per capita and the log of population are both statistically significant at 5% level.\n\nGDP per capita: The hazard ratio of 0.94 indicates that for each unit increase in GDP per capita (measured in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP, in units of $10,000), the hazard (or risk) of being ousted at any given time is reduced by 6%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant. Similarly, it indicates that for each unit increase in the log of population, the hazard (or risk) of being oustedat any given time is reduced by 14%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant.\nPopulation: The hazard ratio of 0.86 indicates that for each unit increase in the logarithm of the population (one percent increase of population), the hazard (or risk) of being ousted at any given time decreases by 14%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant.\n\n5.2 Discussion\nCodetestdata1 &lt;- Mydata1 |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    .by = group,\n    GDP_trend = mean(GDP_trend),\n    GDP_pc = mean(GDP_pc),\n    pop_log = mean(pop_log),\n    polity5 = mean(polity5),\n    polstab = mean(polstab),\n    age = mean(age)\n  )\n\nmodel_cox1 |&gt; \n  survfit(newdata = testdata1) |&gt;\n  ggsurvplot(data = testdata1,\n             xlab = \"Days\",\n             surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n             legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n             legend.labs = c(\"Autocoup leaders\", \"Coup-entry leaders\"))\n\ntestdata2 &lt;- Mydata2 |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    .by = group,\n    GDP_trend = mean(GDP_trend),\n    GDP_pc = mean(GDP_pc),\n    pop_log = mean(pop_log),\n    polity5 = mean(polity5),\n    polstab = mean(polstab),\n    age = mean(age)\n  )\n\nmodel_cox2 |&gt; \n  survfit(newdata = testdata2) |&gt;\n  ggsurvplot(data = testdata2,\n             xlab = \"Days\",\n             surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n             legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n             legend.labs = c(\"Autocoup leaders\", \"Coup-entry leaders\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cox PH Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Time-dependent Cox Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Survival curves for Cox Model\n\n\nThe survival curves depicted in Figure 2 illustrate the survival rates for leaders of both types. Both the Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model and the time-dependent model produce similar plots. Notably, the survival curve for coup-entry leaders exhibits a significantly lower trajectory compared to that of autocoup leaders. The steeper drop at the early stage for coup-entry leaders indicates they are more likely to be ousted shortly after assuming power. Additionally, the survival curve for coup-entry leaders crosses the median survival line much earlier than that of autocoup leaders. This disparity suggests that autocoup leaders tend to remain in power for longer durations than their coup-entry counterparts.\nCodecoxplottidy &lt;- tidy(model_cox1, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(term = c(\"Coup-entry leaders\",\n                      \"GDP Growth Trend\",\n                      \"GDP per capita\",\n                      \"Population: log\",\n                      \"Polity 5\",\n                      \"Political stability\",\n                      \"Age\"))\n\ncoxplottidy |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(\n    y = term,\n    x = estimate,\n    xmin = conf.low,\n    xmax = conf.high\n  )) +\n  geom_pointrange() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Hazard ratios\", y = NULL, title = \"\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\ncoxplottidy &lt;- tidy(model_cox2, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T) |&gt; \n  mutate(term = c(\"Coup-entry leaders\",\n                      \"GDP Growth Trend\",\n                      \"GDP per capita\",\n                      \"Population: log\",\n                      \"Polity 5\",\n                      \"Political stability\",\n                      \"Age\"))\n\ncoxplottidy |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(\n    y = term,\n    x = estimate,\n    xmin = conf.low,\n    xmax = conf.high\n  )) +\n  geom_pointrange() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Hazard ratios\", y = \"\", title = \"\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cox PH Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Time-dependent Cox Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for Leader Ousting\n\n\nFigure 3 displays the hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the variables incorporated in the Cox model. Both the Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model and the time-dependent model yield nearly identical plots. The hazard ratio for coup-entry leaders compared to autocoup leaders is significantly greater than 1 and statistically significant, indicating that coup-entry leaders are at a higher risk of being ousted. Most other variables have hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting that a one-unit increase in these variables does not significantly affect the risk of being ousted. Although the hazard ratio for GDP growth trend is considerably less than 1, it is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it is statistically significant at the 10% level, suggesting that better economic performance may help to consolidate the rule of the incumbents to some extent.\nFigure 3 presents the hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the variables included in the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox PH) and the time-dependent model. The HR for coup-entry leaders compared to autocoup leaders is significantly greater than 1, indicating a substantially higher risk of removal from power for coup-entry leaders. Most other variables have HRs close to 1, suggesting that a one-unit increase in those variables has minimal impact on the risk of removal.\nThe HR for GDP growth trend is noteworthy. While it is considerably less than 1, it is statistically significant at the 10% level (0.10 &gt; p-value &gt; 0.05). This suggests a possible trend where positive economic performance might reduce the risk of removal from power for the incumbents, although the evidence is not conclusive.\n\n5.3 Assessing the Proportional Hazards Assumption\nThe validity of the model assumptions significantly influences our confidence in the results. To assess the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model, we use the chi-square test based on Schoenfeld residuals to determine whether the covariate effects remain constant (proportional) over time. Although the Cox PH model violates the proportional hazards assumption, our primary analysis relies on the time-dependent Cox model, which does not show strong evidence of violating the proportional hazards assumption for any covariate. The global p-value of 0.382 is much greater than the 5% significance level, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption is reasonably met for the time-dependent Cox model."

    "text": "6 Conclusion\nThis study examined the survival durations of political leaders who come to power through irregular means, specifically coups and autocoups. We hypothesized that the mode of accession significantly influences leader tenure. Employing survival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a time-dependent Cox model, we found strong evidence that autocoup leaders generally enjoy longer tenures than coup-entry leaders.\nOur findings revealed a significant difference in average tenure, with post-autocoup leaders averaging approximately 10.8 years in power compared to 5.4 years for coup-entry leaders. The time-dependent Cox model further indicated that coup-entry leaders are 2.42 times more likely to be ousted from power at any given time compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal.\nThese results highlight the importance of understanding the phenomenon of autocoups, where leaders extend their rule by manipulating legal frameworks. Due to the relative ease and potential benefits of autocoups, this method of power retention might incentivize more leaders to employ it. Consequently, democratic backsliding could become more prevalent as autocoups weaken democratic institutions and constitutional norms, particularly in nascent democracies or those transitioning from autocracy.\nThis study contributes to the field of leadership survival by demonstrating that the mode of accession significantly impacts leader tenure, a factor previously under-explored in the literature. By utilizing both Cox models, the research offers robust analytical techniques for studying political leadership survival and provides strong evidence of divergent tenure lengths between these two types of irregular-entry leaders.\nHowever, limitations exist. The study relies heavily on the autocoup dataset collected and coded by the author. The concept and data itself are relatively novel within academia. Future research should refine and establish wider recognition for the term “autocoup,” leading to more accurate and comprehensive data collection efforts. Expanding the dataset to include more cases and integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions could yield a more holistic understanding of political survival in such contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders\nFigure 2 (a): Cox PH Model\nFigure 2 (b): Time-dependent Cox Model\nFigure 3 (a): Cox PH Model\nFigure 3 (b): Time-dependent Cox Model"

    "section": "\n1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nWhy do some leaders rule for decades while others stay in power for only years, months, or even days? This question has garnered substantial attention, making the survival of political leaders a well-explored topic in political science. Although the general framework of political survival has been extensively studied and numerous theories have been proposed, specific types of leaders—particularly coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders (defined in more detail in Chapter 3)—have received comparatively less scrutiny. Nonetheless, examining the tenures of these specific leader types is particularly significant, as it provides insights into the dynamics of irregular leadership transitions and their impact on political stability and democratic processes.\nThe processes of entry, tenure, and exit are more predictable for leaders who come to power through regular channels, making their survival easier to anticipate and thus less compelling to study. In contrast, leaders who ascend through irregular means, such as coups or autocoups, attract more interest from both academics and journalists due to the unpredictable and often tumultuous nature of their tenures. According to Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009), leaders with irregular entries or exits are quite common. Between 1945 and 2015, more than half of the leaders who entered power irregularly (158 out of 308) eventually exited irregularly as well. This rate is significantly higher than that of leaders who assumed office through regular channels, of whom only 14.5% (213 out of 1,472) experienced irregular exits. While this percentage is still notable, it is considerably lower than that for irregular-entry leaders.\nAmong leaders with irregular entry or exit, coup-entry and autocoup leaders constitute the majority. According to Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009), out of 374 leaders who exited irregularly, 246 were ousted through coups, accounting for 65.8% of these cases. Frantz and Stein (2016) show that coup-related exits account for roughly one-third of all exits in autocracies, surpassing any other type, including regular transitions. Additionally, between 1945 and 2020, there were 106 autocoup attempts, with 86 being successful (Zhu 2024).\nDue to their irregularity and inherent uncertainty, precisely measuring the survival tenure of coup-entry and autocoup leaders presents a significant challenge. Nonetheless, a comparative analysis of the tenures of these two types of leaders is both feasible and valuable. Leaders who consolidate power through autocoups have a longer average tenure post-autocoup (approximately 10.8 years) compared to coup-entry leaders (approximately 5.4 years). This suggests a potential shortfall of about 5 years in the average tenure of coup-entry leaders.\n\nCode# Fit survival curves\nfit &lt;- survfit(Surv(survival_year, status) ~ group, data = Mydata1)\n# Create log-rank plot (Kaplan-Meier plot)\nggsurvplot(fit, \n           data = Mydata1, \n           risk.table = TRUE, \n           risk.table.height = 0.3, \n           pval = TRUE,\n           surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n           break.x.by = 5, \n           legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n           legend.labs = c(\"Autocoup leaders\", \"Coup-entry leaders\"),\n           xlab = \"Survival Years\",\n           #title = \"Survival Curves of overstay and coup-entry leaders\",\n           font.title = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders\n\n\n\n\nA preliminary analysis using a log-rank test in survival analysis, as shown in Figure 1, reveals a distinct contrast in the tenures of autocoup leaders versus coup-entry leaders. The survival curve for autocoup leaders is consistently higher than that for coup-entry leaders, and the difference is statistically significant. This indicates that autocoup leaders generally have a longer survival tenure and a lower risk of being ousted compared to coup-entry leaders.\nWe argue that the method of accession significantly influences leadership longevity. Coup-entry leaders are likely to face greater challenges to their rule, resulting in a shorter average tenure compared to autocoup leaders.\nUsing the Cox proportional hazards model and the time-dependent Cox model, our results indicate that autocoup leaders generally experience longer tenures compared to coup-entry leaders.\nThis study makes two potential contributions. Firstly, it sheds light on an understudied factor in leadership survival analysis: the impact of the method of accession to power. Leaders’ survival is influenced not only by their ruling strategies after taking power but also by how they acquired power initially. Secondly, by utilizing survival models, this research provides empirical evidence of the significant difference in tenure duration between autocoup and coup-entry leaders. This finding may help explain the increasing prevalence of overstaying in power through autocoups since 2000. As more incumbents observe these precedents, they may be encouraged to adopt similar tactics, with ruling elites tending to follow and support such actions to benefit from a relatively longer tenure.\nThe remainder of the paper delves deeper into this topic. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive literature review on political survival, establishing the context for this research. Chapter 3 explores the factors influencing the survival of coup and autocoup leaders. Chapter 4 outlines the methodology and data used, including the application of survival models to analyze the determinants of leadership longevity. Chapter 5 presents the findings of the analysis and a detailed discussion of the results. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes by synthesizing the key takeaways and exploring their broader implications."

    "section": "\n2 Literature review",
    "text": "2 Literature review\nThe topic of political survival has been a cornerstone of political science research for decades. This enduring interest arises from the wide-ranging variations observed across regimes, countries, and historical periods. Previous studies have identified two crucial yet interconnected aspects of political survival: regime survival and individual leader survival.\nRegime survival focuses on the longevity of political systems, such as monarchies, political parties, or specific ideological structures. Leader survival, on the other hand, is concerned with the duration of individual leaders’ time in office. These two concepts often exhibit contrasting patterns. For example, in parliamentary democracies like Japan or the UK, specific political parties may hold power for extended periods while individual leaders (Prime Ministers) change frequently. Similarly, communist regimes typically see long-lasting parties in power, with leadership transitions occurring at a more frequent pace. In contrast, presidential systems like the United States or some military regimes experience more frequent changes in both the ruling party or junta and the leader of the country. This study specifically investigates the dynamics of individual leader survival, focusing on the factors influencing how long leaders remain in power.\nThe existing literature on leader survival is vast and multifaceted, offering a wealth of insightful perspectives. Some studies delve into the specific mechanisms that influence leadership longevity within particular regimes, such as democracies (Svolik 2014) or autocracies (Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood 2021). Others seek to develop more generalizable theoretical frameworks that can explain leader survival across diverse political systems (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003). While the development of a universal theory remains an alluring goal, it is important to acknowledge the inherent challenges in creating a single model that encompasses the complexities of leadership survival across all regime types.\nThe mechanisms governing power transitions vary significantly across different regimes, particularly between democracies and autocracies. In many autocratic systems, leadership selection is a closed affair. Potential candidates are often restricted to a narrow pool, such as royal families, military elites, or members of the ruling party. While political competition and elections may exist in some autocracies, there are often significant barriers to entry for legitimate challengers. Potential rivals may face threats such as assassination, imprisonment, or exile. Moreover, selection processes are shrouded in secrecy, with outsiders unable to participate or obtain information on the selections, let alone express dissent or complain about the results. This lack of inclusivity and transparency makes it challenging to gauge true levels of public support compared to democracies. Consequently, calculating selectorates or winning coalitions, as explored by Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003), becomes a near-impossible task in autocracies.\nTherefore, focusing research on more specific regimes or types of leaders may be more appropriate. While regular and anticipated leadership changes are important as well, they offer less fertile ground for exploring the dynamics of leader longevity, as the vast majority of leaders who assume power through established channels also exit power through established mechanisms (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009). In contrast, the study of political survival among irregular leaders is particularly captivating due to the intricacies and uncertainties associated with irregular leadership transitions.\nThe diverse mechanisms influencing political leadership survival, as discussed above, have prompted scholars to delve deeper into more specific determinants. Two primary perspectives have emerged to explain the dynamics of leader survival.\nThe first perspective considers objective factors and resources available to leaders. These include elements such as personal competence (Yu and Jong-A-Pin 2016), societal stability (Arriola 2009), economic development (Palmer and Whitten 1999; Williams 2011), access to natural resources (Smith 2004; Quiroz Flores and Smith 2012; Wright, Frantz, and Geddes 2013), or external support networks (Licht 2009; Wright 2008; Thyne et al. 2017).\nThe second perspective explores subjective factors, focusing on the strategies leaders employ to consolidate their power. This encompasses both the formulation and implementation of political policies and the leaders’ responses to opposition, challenges, or even coups and rebellions (Gandhi and Przeworski 2007; Morrison 2009; Escribà-Folch 2013; Davenport, RezaeeDaryakenari, and Wood 2021).\nUnsurprisingly, coups have garnered significant scholarly attention due to their pivotal role in removing leaders (Svolik 2009; Frantz and Stein 2016). Existing research delves into strategies for thwarting coups (J. Powell 2017; Sudduth 2017; De Bruin 2020), as well as how leaders extend their tenures after surviving coup attempts (Easton and Siverson 2018). For instance, Sudduth (2017) examines the post-coup actions of dictators, focusing on purge strategies. They argue that coup leaders initially wield more power than elites within the regime, rendering them less susceptible to subsequent coups, challenging the conventional view of new leaders as inherently weak (Roessler 2011). Meanwhile, Sudduth and Bell (2018) investigates how leaders’ entry methods affect their removal in dictatorships, positing that irregular entry does not necessarily increase the likelihood of removal; in fact, some forms of irregular entry may offer protection.\nWhile scholars have extensively analysed leader survival across various contexts, including universal frameworks, autocratic regimes, and the aftermath of failed challenges, a significant gap persists. There is a lack of research specifically exploring and comparing the survival tenures of leaders who extend their reigns through autocoups compared to coup-entry leaders. This study aims to address this gap by investigating and comparing the duration of leadership survival between these two distinct leader types."

    "text": "3 Survival dynamics of autocoup and coup-entry leaders\n\n3.1 Autocoup leaders versus coup-entry leaders\nAs emphasized in Chapter 2, delving into leadership survival poses inherent challenges, given factors such as the opacity and diverse mechanisms of power transitions. However, these challenges underscore the significance of this research, as it sheds light on understudied dynamics.\nWhile the survival of political leaders manifests complexity and variation, it is not devoid of patterns entirely. Leaders of similar types often exhibit significant comparability. Before delving into the comparison, it is necessary to clarify several relative terminologies.\nFirstly, we define an autocoup as a situation where an incumbent leader utilizes illegitimate or unconstitutional methods to extend their tenure and remain in power. An autocoup is deemed successful if this power extension lasts for at least six months. Coups, on the other hand, are defined as illegal and overt attempts by the military or other powerful groups within the state to unseat the sitting leader (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011). Similar to coups, successful autocoups in this study will be measured by a power usurpation lasting at least six months, differing from the seven-day duration coded by Powell and Thyne.\nSecondly, it is also crucial to clarify the distinction between an autocoup leader and a coup-entry leader, as the survival of leadership is the main concern of this study.\n\nAutocoup leader: This refers to an incumbent leader who successfully uses illegitimate or unconstitutional means to extend their tenure in power. In an autocoup, the leader orchestrates the power grab and continues to rule afterwards.\nCoup-entry leader: This term designates the individual who assumes power after a successful coup. The coup leader and the coup-entry leader may or may not be the same person. Unlike in autocoups, coups often involve multiple leaders (individuals or groups) who overthrow the incumbent leader, but typically only one of them assumes supreme power. In some instances, coup leaders may support someone outside the coup plot to become the new leader. For example, military officers might return power to civilians after a coup or support a new general election. Regardless of the specific scenario, a coup-entry leader in this study refers to the individual who assumes formal leadership following a successful coup.\n\nGiven that autocoup leaders typically exhibit longer overall tenures compared to coup-entry leaders, this study focuses on a more nuanced comparison. Specifically, we will analyse the post-autocoup tenure of autocoup leaders and contrast it with the post-coup tenure of coup-entry leaders. The examination of the survival tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders is motivated by their relevance and similarity in terms of illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability.\n\n3.2 Hypothesis\nPrevious research emphasizes that skilful power retention is the ultimate determinant of leader longevity. Leaders who can maintain control or manipulate the balance of power tend to stay in office longer. However, as discussed earlier, although both coup-entry and autocoup leaders face similar challenges, the intensity of their challenges related to illegitimacy, uncertainty, and instability differs. These discrepancies create an uneven playing field in terms of power dynamics, with coup-entry leaders at a significant disadvantage. This disparity in power equilibrium shapes a nuanced landscape that profoundly impacts the duration of leader tenures.\n\n3.2.1 Illegitimacy\nBoth leader types lack legitimacy, though it manifests differently. Coup leaders seize power through force or the threat of force, making their illegitimacy explicit. Autocoups often employ seemingly legal procedures, but these processes are frequently manipulated by incumbents leveraging their control (Zhu 2024). This perception of illegitimacy can be used to justify the removal of autocoup and coup-entry leaders, even if the means of removal are themselves illegitimate.\nWhile both coup-entry and autocoup leaders lack genuine legitimacy, the nature of this illegitimacy differs significantly. Coups represent a more blatant disregard for legal processes, often involving force or the threat of force to seize power. In contrast, autocoups employ a façade of legality through tactics such as manipulating constitutional interpretations, engineering parliamentary votes, influencing court decisions, and even holding referendums. Despite this veneer, these manoeuvres do not erase the underlying lack of genuine legitimacy, hence this study categorizes them as autocoups. However, there is considerable debate among scholars, with some arguing for less severe terms like “incumbent overstay” or “executive takeover” due to the perceived legality.\nThis perceived legitimacy can provide a temporary advantage for autocoup leaders. Challengers are often constrained to operate within legal frameworks, making it difficult to directly confront the incumbent.\n\n3.2.2 Uncertainty\nThe tumultuous paths to power undertaken by coup-initiators and autocratic leaders cast a shadow of uncertainty over their reigns and eventual departure. Their ascension through irregular means undermines established power transition norms, leaving doubts lingering over their commitment to constitutional succession protocols. This uncertainty not only unsettles elites and citizens but also plagues the leaders themselves, who grapple with the perpetual ambiguity surrounding the transfer of power – when, how, and to whom. Historical analyses underscore this predicament, with data revealing that more than two-thirds of irregular exits from leadership stem from coup-related upheavals (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\nCoup-entry and autocoup leaders face different levels of uncertainty immediately following their rise to or overstay power.\nAfter a coup, at least three major uncertainties arise regarding leadership and its tenure. First, it is unclear who will assume leadership. Although coup leaders often take power, some may return or promise to return power to civilian leaders. Even among coup leaders, determining who will lead can be problematic, as coup plotters are sometimes a group without a clear core leader. For instance, following the 1973 Chilean coup, the initial plan for a rotating presidency among military leaders was abandoned when General Pinochet consolidated control and remained in power until 1990 (Svolik 2014). Second, the duration of the coup leader’s rule is uncertain. Leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt (1954 coup), Muammar Gaddafi in Libya (1969 coup), and Idi Amin in Uganda (1971 coup) aimed to retain power for life (Geddes, Wright, and Frantz 2018), but their ability to do so was uncertain. Others promise to transfer power to civilian authorities, but the timing and fulfillment of these promises are unclear. For example, Myanmar’s military junta (2021 coup) has repeatedly extended a state of emergency, clinging to power beyond the promised time-frame1. Conversely, after the 2010 coup in Niger, the military honoured their promise by restoring civilian rule within the same year (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019). Third, the successors of coup leaders are uncertain. Some may designate successors from their inner circle, including family members, while others may support general elections, though whether this will be fulfilled as intended remains uncertain.\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders present a clearer picture regarding leadership and tenure. There is no ambiguity about who will rule after an autocoup. In the medium term, autocoup leaders typically hold office themselves. Many, like Putin in Russia and Xi Jinping in China, seek to extend their rule indefinitely and are unlikely to relinquish power voluntarily. Others attempt to extend their terms incrementally, such as President Menem of Argentina, who overstayed until 1993 but failed in his bid for another term in 1999 (Llanos 2019).\n\n3.2.3 Instability\nMoreover, the awareness of their shaky legitimacy and the persistent uncertainty breeds insecurity and a perpetual sense of crisis among coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. In a bid to solidify their grip on power, they often resort to reshaping power dynamics or purging potential adversaries. Paradoxically, these attempts to bolster stability and fortify their rule frequently boomerang, unleashing even greater turmoil and instability.\nThe stability of a regime, particularly in an autocracy, hinges on maintaining a balance of power. Coups, however, inevitably disrupt this balance, even when they are bloodless, necessitating the creation of a new equilibrium. The ousting of previous rulers requires dismantling the established governing structure and reshuffling high-ranking officials, actions that inherently generate instability and create adversaries for the new leadership. This makes restoring order and establishing a balanced power structure notably challenging. Studies show that new leaders often purge rival elite groups to consolidate their power at the outset of their tenure (Sudduth 2017; Roessler 2011). Such actions can provoke backlash even from close allies. For instance, in Uganda, President Obote’s attempt to undermine the army commander-in-chief, Idi Amin, led to Amin gaining the army’s support and ultimately ousting Obote in a 1971 coup. Similarly, in Pakistan in 1999, shortly after Prime Minister Sharif dismissed powerful army chief General Pervez Musharraf, Sharif himself was ousted in a coup orchestrated by Musharraf and his supporters (Sudduth 2017).\nTo consolidate power, coup-entry leaders often have to compromise with internal or external power challengers. However, these compromises are frequently unstable and easily broken. The situation becomes even more complex when there is a risk of civil war. Leaders may attempt to reduce the likelihood of subsequent coups, potentially increasing the chances of societal rebellions and civil wars (Roessler 2011).\nMoreover, instability extends beyond leadership to policies. A new leadership group often brings new policies, and coups are sometimes triggered by disagreements over significant policies. Major policy shifts can instigate dissent or grievances from various ruling factions, communities, regions, ethnicities, or religions.\nIn contrast, autocoup leaders encounter far fewer of these issues, as their regimes experience fewer abrupt changes. They face less pressure to dismantle the existing ruling paradigm and establish a new order. Even when adjustments are necessary, they have more time to implement changes gradually.\nCode# library(kableExtra)\nread.csv(here(\"data/leader_comparison.csv\")) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    1 ~ px(100),\n    2:3 ~ px(250)\n  ) |&gt;\n   data_color(rows = c(2, 4), colors = \"#edede9\") \n\n\nTable 1: Main features of autocoup and coup-entry leaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nAutocoup Leader\nCoup Entry Leader\n\n\n\nIllegitimacy\nNormally attained through lawful procedures, but lacking consensus legitimacy\nBlatantly illegal\n\n\nUncertainty\nInitially with some certainty, but decreases as the leader's age grows or health worsens\nSignificant uncertainty initially\n\n\nInstability\nRelatively stable\nUnstable except when a strongman emerges or constitutional institutions are established\n\n\nBalance of Power\nGenerally in a better position of power\nInitially unclear and challenging to establish a balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, coup-entry leaders face a significantly greater degree of the challenges discussed earlier, placing them at a substantial disadvantage in the power dynamic compared to autocoup leaders. This disadvantage creates a self-perpetuating cycle. Weaker leaders struggle to attract and retain strong support, making them more vulnerable to internal and external challenges. The perception of risk discourages potential allies, further eroding their power base.\nEmpirical evidence bolsters this dynamic. Data reveals a correlation between the frequency of coup attempts in a country and the likelihood of future coups (e.g., Table 2 shows over a third of coups occurring in the top ten countries with the most attempts since 1950). This suggests that the more coups occur in a country, the more likely additional coups are to happen in the future.\n\nCodecoup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/powell_thyne_coups_final.txt\",\n                 sep = \"\\t\")\n\ncoups &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    `Coup attempted` = n(),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coup == 2),\n    .by = country\n  )\n\ncoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt;\n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`,\n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;\n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts (1950–2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversely, autocoup leaders, often benefiting from a veneer of legitimacy and a stronger initial position, are better able to consolidate power and attract supporters. This advantage can be self-reinforcing, as a strong power base discourages challenges and fosters loyalty. This dynamic is evident in cases like China (2018), where the National People’s Congress granted Xi Jinping the potential to rule for life2, and Russia (2020), where constitutional changes allow Putin to potentially remain in power until 20363.\nThese features and the balance of power contribute to a shorter expected tenure for coup-entry leaders compared to the relatively longer tenures of autocoup leaders. The average survival period following an autocoup is approximately five years longer than that of coup-entry leaders (Figure 1). Based on these observations and discussions, I propose the following hypothesis:\n\nH1: Political leaders who successfully extend their tenure through autocoups are more likely to experience longer leadership survival compared to coup-entry leaders.\n\nIn the subsequent section, I will outline the research methodology used in this paper. I will introduce several control variables to determine if the hypothesis remains persistent and robust.\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2023/08/myanmar-junta-extends-state-of-emergency-for-fourth-time/: Myanmar\nJunta Extends State of Emergency for Fourth Time.

    "text": "4 Research Design\n\n4.1 Methodology: Survival analysis\nTo test the hypothesis, I will employ two Cox models to analyse the survival tenures of coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. Unlike the Kaplan-Meier model, the Cox model enables the estimation of the impacts of multiple factors. Although it does not directly estimate the duration of tenure in office, it evaluates the hazard rate associated with being ousted from power. Essentially, this represents different facets of the same phenomenon: as a leader’s cumulative hazard of being ousted increases, their probability of survival in office decreases.\nThe first model will utilize the Cox proportional hazards model (referred to as the Cox PH model), where I will only use the variables present at the entry year, without considering the changes in these variables over the leaders’ survival times.\nHowever, apart from the primary variable of interest in this research—the leader type—control variables such as economic performance, Polity5 scores, and political stability do change over time. Therefore, the second model will account for these variations by using the time-dependent Cox model.\n\n4.2 Data\nThe main variables are as follows.\n\n4.2.1 Dependent variables\n\nSurvival Time: The duration of a leader’s tenure, measured in days. For coup-entry leaders, the survival time begins on the day they assume power through a coup. For autocoup leaders, the survival time starts on the expiration date of their original legitimate term. For example, Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013 and removed term limits in 2018. His original legitimate tenure was set to end in 2023, so his survival time begins in 2023, not 2013 or 2018, marking the start of his post-autocoup tenure. The survival time concludes on the day the leader exits office, applicable to both coup-entry and autocoup leaders.\n\nEnd point status: This variable indicates the manner in which the leader’s tenure concluded, categorized as follows:\n\n0 = Censored: This status is assigned to leaders who leave office through means other than being ousted. This includes leaders who appoint their successors, opt for democratic transitions, or leave office due to health issues or natural death.\n1 = Ousted: This status is assigned to leaders who are forced out of office. This includes cases where leaders “voluntarily” resign under pressure, reflecting a de facto ousting by force.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Key Independent variable: Leader type\nThis variable categorizes leaders into two distinct groups:\n\nGroup A = Autocoup Leader: Leaders who extend their tenure through autocoups.\nGroup B = Coup-Entry Leader: Leaders who assume power through coups.This variable is the primary independent variable of interest, serving as the basis for comparing the survival time between these two types of leaders.\n\nThe data for both dependent and independent variables are sourced from Zhu (2024) and Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza (2009).\n\n4.2.3 Control variables\n\n\nEconomic Performance: This variable is measured using two indicators: economic level and economic growth rate.\n\nEconomic Level: Represented by GDP per capita. This measure provides an indication of the overall economic health and standard of living in a country.\nEconomic Growth Trend: Assessed using the current-trend (CT) ratio, developed by Krishnarajan (2019). The CT ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher CT ratio signifies stronger economic performance.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe GDP per capita data, expressed in constant 2017 international dollars (PPP) and measured in units of $10,000, is sourced from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022). To account for the economic impact of the previous year, this data is lagged by one year.\n\nPolitical Stability: This variable captures overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. The data for this index is sourced from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall. This index provides a comprehensive measure of the level of violence and conflict within a country, which can significantly impact leadership survival. (Marshall 2005).\nDegree of Democracy: The level of democracy is gauged using Polity 5 scores at the entry year for each respective country. These scores range from -10 (fully autocratic) to +10 (fully democratic), capturing the extent of democratic versus autocratic governance. This dataset is sourced from the Center for Systemic Peace (CSP)1 and provides an essential measure of political regime type, which can influence the stability and survival of leaders in power.\nPopulation Size: To account for its potential impact on leaders’ tenures, the log of the population size is considered. This transformation helps in managing the wide range of population sizes across different countries. The data is sourced from the V-Dem dataset and is evaluated to understand its influence on leadership survival. Larger populations may present more governance challenges and potential sources of opposition, thereby affecting the stability and longevity of a leader’s tenure.\nLeader’s Age: The age of the leader at the entry year is included as an additional variable in the analysis, offering insights into potential correlations with leadership survival. Older leaders may have different experiences, networks, and health considerations that could influence their ability to maintain power. This data is sourced from the leaders dataset by (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009).\n\nBased on the methods and variables, we have the model as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSurv(survival\\_time, status) &= Group + \\\\\n&GDP\\_growth\\_trend + GDP\\_per\\_capita + \\\\\n&pop\\_log + polity5 + Stability + age\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nCenter for Systemic Peace: https://www.systemicpeace.org.

Coup-entry leaders were found to have a hazard ratio of 2.42 (in time-dependent Cox model) compared to autocoup leaders (reference group), assuming all other variables in the model are held constant. The analysis suggests that coup-entry leaders face a significantly greater risk of removal from power compared to autocoup leaders. At any given time during their tenure, coup-entry leaders are 2.42 times more likely to be ousted from power compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal in the model.\nAll other control variables in Cox PH model are not statistically significant. In time-dependent Cox model, however, GDP per capita and the log of population are both statistically significant at 5% level.\n\nGDP per capita: The hazard ratio of 0.94 indicates that for each unit increase in GDP per capita (measured in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP, in units of $10,000), the hazard (or risk) of being ousted at any given time is reduced by 6%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant. Similarly, it indicates that for each unit increase in the log of population, the hazard (or risk) of being oustedat any given time is reduced by 14%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant.\nPopulation: The hazard ratio of 0.86 indicates that for each unit increase in the logarithm of the population (one percent increase of population), the hazard (or risk) of being ousted at any given time decreases by 14%, assuming all other variables in the model are held constant.\n\n\n5.2 Discussion\nCodetestdata1 &lt;- Mydata1 |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    .by = group,\n    GDP_trend = mean(GDP_trend),\n    GDP_pc = mean(GDP_pc),\n    pop_log = mean(pop_log),\n    polity5 = mean(polity5),\n    polstab = mean(polstab),\n    age = mean(age)\n  )\n\nmodel_cox1 |&gt; \n  survfit(newdata = testdata1) |&gt;\n  ggsurvplot(data = testdata1,\n             xlab = \"Days\",\n             surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n             legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n             legend.labs = c(\"Autocoup leaders\", \"Coup-entry leaders\"))\n\ntestdata2 &lt;- Mydata2 |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    .by = group,\n    GDP_trend = mean(GDP_trend),\n    GDP_pc = mean(GDP_pc),\n    pop_log = mean(pop_log),\n    polity5 = mean(polity5),\n    polstab = mean(polstab),\n    age = mean(age)\n  )\n\nmodel_cox2 |&gt; \n  survfit(newdata = testdata2) |&gt;\n  ggsurvplot(data = testdata2,\n             xlab = \"Days\",\n             surv.median.line = \"hv\",\n             legend.title = \"Leader Type\",\n             legend.labs = c(\"Autocoup leaders\", \"Coup-entry leaders\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cox PH Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Time-dependent Cox Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Survival curves for Cox Model\n\n\nThe survival curves depicted in Figure 2 illustrate the survival rates for leaders of both types. Both the Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model and the time-dependent model produce similar plots. Notably, the survival curve for coup-entry leaders exhibits a significantly lower trajectory compared to that of autocoup leaders. The steeper drop at the early stage for coup-entry leaders indicates they are more likely to be ousted shortly after assuming power. Additionally, the survival curve for coup-entry leaders crosses the median survival line much earlier than that of autocoup leaders. This disparity suggests that autocoup leaders tend to remain in power for longer durations than their coup-entry counterparts.\nCodecoxplottidy &lt;- tidy(model_cox1, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(term = c(\"Coup-entry leaders\",\n                      \"GDP Growth Trend\",\n                      \"GDP per capita\",\n                      \"Population: log\",\n                      \"Polity 5\",\n                      \"Political stability\",\n                      \"Age\"))\n\ncoxplottidy |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(\n    y = term,\n    x = estimate,\n    xmin = conf.low,\n    xmax = conf.high\n  )) +\n  geom_pointrange() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Hazard ratios\", y = NULL, title = \"\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\ncoxplottidy &lt;- tidy(model_cox2, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T) |&gt; \n  mutate(term = c(\"Coup-entry leaders\",\n                      \"GDP Growth Trend\",\n                      \"GDP per capita\",\n                      \"Population: log\",\n                      \"Polity 5\",\n                      \"Political stability\",\n                      \"Age\"))\n\ncoxplottidy |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(\n    y = term,\n    x = estimate,\n    xmin = conf.low,\n    xmax = conf.high\n  )) +\n  geom_pointrange() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1,\n             linetype = \"dashed\",\n             color = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Hazard ratios\", y = \"\", title = \"\") +\n  theme_bw() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cox PH Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Time-dependent Cox Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Hazard ratios and 95% CIs for Leader Ousting\n\n\nFigure 3 displays the hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the variables incorporated in the Cox model. Both the Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model and the time-dependent model yield nearly identical plots. The hazard ratio for coup-entry leaders compared to autocoup leaders is significantly greater than 1 and statistically significant, indicating that coup-entry leaders are at a higher risk of being ousted. Most other variables have hazard ratios close to 1, suggesting that a one-unit increase in these variables does not significantly affect the risk of being ousted. Although the hazard ratio for GDP growth trend is considerably less than 1, it is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it is statistically significant at the 10% level, suggesting that better economic performance may help to consolidate the rule of the incumbents to some extent.\nFigure 3 presents the hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the variables included in the Cox proportional hazards model (Cox PH) and the time-dependent model. The HR for coup-entry leaders compared to autocoup leaders is significantly greater than 1, indicating a substantially higher risk of removal from power for coup-entry leaders. Most other variables have HRs close to 1, suggesting that a one-unit increase in those variables has minimal impact on the risk of removal.\nThe HR for GDP growth trend is noteworthy. While it is considerably less than 1, it is statistically significant at the 10% level (0.10 &gt; p-value &gt; 0.05). This suggests a possible trend where positive economic performance might reduce the risk of removal from power for the incumbents, although the evidence is not conclusive.\n\n5.3 Assessing the Proportional Hazards Assumption\nThe validity of the model assumptions significantly influences our confidence in the results. To assess the proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model, we use the chi-square test based on Schoenfeld residuals to determine whether the covariate effects remain constant (proportional) over time. Although the Cox PH model violates the proportional hazards assumption, our primary analysis relies on the time-dependent Cox model, which does not show strong evidence of violating the proportional hazards assumption for any covariate. The global p-value of 0.382 is much greater than the 5% significance level, indicating that the proportional hazards assumption is reasonably met for the time-dependent Cox model."

    "text": "6 Conclusion\nThis study examined the survival durations of political leaders who come to power through irregular means, specifically coups and autocoups. We hypothesized that the mode of accession significantly influences leader tenure. Employing survival analysis techniques, including the Cox proportional hazards model and a time-dependent Cox model, we found strong evidence that autocoup leaders generally enjoy longer tenures than coup-entry leaders.\nOur findings revealed a significant difference in average tenure, with post-autocoup leaders averaging approximately 10.8 years in power compared to 5.4 years for coup-entry leaders. The time-dependent Cox model further indicated that coup-entry leaders are 2.42 times more likely to be ousted from power at any given time compared to autocoup leaders, all else being equal.\nThese results highlight the importance of understanding the phenomenon of autocoups, where leaders extend their rule by manipulating legal frameworks. Due to the relative ease and potential benefits of autocoups, this method of power retention might incentivize more leaders to employ it. Consequently, democratic backsliding could become more prevalent as autocoups weaken democratic institutions and constitutional norms, particularly in nascent democracies or those transitioning from autocracy.\nThis study contributes to the field of leadership survival by demonstrating that the mode of accession significantly impacts leader tenure, a factor previously under-explored in the literature. By utilizing both Cox models, the research offers robust analytical techniques for studying political leadership survival and provides strong evidence of divergent tenure lengths between these two types of irregular-entry leaders.\nHowever, limitations exist. The study relies heavily on the autocoup dataset collected and coded by the author. The concept and data itself are relatively novel within academia. Future research should refine and establish wider recognition for the term “autocoup,” leading to more accurate and comprehensive data collection efforts. Expanding the dataset to include more cases and integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions could yield a more holistic understanding of political survival in such contexts.\n\n\n\n\nCan.Do.So\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Survival curves of overstaying and coup-entry leaders\nFigure 2 (a): Cox PH Model\nFigure 2 (b): Time-dependent Cox Model\nFigure 3 (a): Cox PH Model\nFigure 3 (b): Time-dependent Cox Model\n\n\n\nArriola, Leonardo R. 2009. “Patronage and Political Stability in Africa.” Comparative Political Studies 42 (10): 1339–62. https://doi.org/10.1177/0010414009332126.\n\n\nBueno de Mesquita, Bruce, Alastair Smith, Randolph M.

It highlights the critical role of power dynamics, shaped by regime types, in determining coup success rates and attempt frequency. Utilizing Heckman’s two-stage selection model, the study reveals that expected coup success significantly influences attempts, with military regimes facing a heightened vulnerability due to their power structure.\nWhile often understudied, autocoups are shown to have a substantial impact on democratic trends.

This contrasts with autocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend their rule, suggesting the potential for autocoups to incentivize power grabs and contribute to democratic backsliding.\nThis work contributes significantly to the political science literature by: - Defining key concepts: It establishes a clear definition of autocoups, a previously understudied phenomenon. - Introducing a novel dataset: This dataset enables researchers to conduct more comprehensive quantitative analyses of autocoups. - Establishing a general framework: The framework provides a comparative approach to studying the dynamics of irregular power transitions and their impact on democratic stability. \n\n\n\n\n\nJul 7, 2024\n\n\nZhu Qi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutocoups: Conceptual Clarification and Analysis of Power Extensions by Incumbent Leaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCoups\n\n\nAutocoups\n\n\n\nThis study aims to clarify the concept of autocoups, specifically focusing on power extensions by incumbent leaders. By distinguishing autocoups from the broader and more ambiguous concepts of self-coups or executive takeover, which encompass both executive power aggrandizement and power extension, this research redefines the concept of autocoups. Based on this refined definition, we introduce a novel dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2022.\nUsing the newly compiled dataset, the research includes three types of case studies that provide qualitative insights into the dynamics of autocoups. Additionally, an empirical analysis on the determinants of autocoup attempts and success is offered to demonstrate how the autocoup dataset can be employed for more quantitative research.\nThis study contributes to the existing literature by providing a clearer conceptual framework and a novel dataset of autocoups. It enhances our understanding of the mechanisms and motivations behind power extensions by incumbent leaders and examines the implications for democratic backsliding, democratic breakdown, personalization, and autocratic deterioration. The insights gained from this study could draw more attention to the effects of autocoups on power transitions, political stability, and democratic resilience. \n\n\n\n\n\nJun 14, 2024\n\n\nZhu Qi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Acquisition and Leadership Survival: A Comparative Analysis of Coup-Entry and Autocoup Leaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCoups\n\n\n\nThis study examines how the method of power acquisition impacts the longevity of two main types of irregular-entry political leaders: coup-entry leaders and autocoup leaders. We hypothesize that the method of accession significantly affects leader tenure. Utilizing the Cox proportional hazards model and a time-dependent Cox model, we provide compelling evidence of differing survival times between these two leader types. The findings indicate that coup-entry leaders face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to autocoup leaders. Specifically, coup-entry leaders are found to have a much shorter average tenure and a higher probability of being ousted. This study underscores the implications of these findings for political stability and democratic processes, suggesting that the relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could incentivize more incumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to democratic backsliding.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoups occur with varying frequency across different countries, with some experiencing them more frequently than others. According to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC)1 dataset (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011), Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between \\(1950\\) and \\(1984\\), while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar time frame. However, Mexico’s authoritarian period from \\(1917\\) to \\(2000\\) saw no coups at all. In Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between \\(1955\\) and \\(2023\\), whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since \\(1950\\). Similar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia.\nThe varying frequency of coup attempts has captivated political scientists for decades, leading to extensive research on the subject. As highlighted by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), despite approximately one hundred potential determinants of coups being suggested, no consensus has been reached. In an effort to address this issue, Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016) tested 66 factors proposed in previous literature using three million model permutations in an extreme bounds analysis.\nExamining previous research, which has tested around 100 variables as potential determinants of coups, raises an important question beyond simply understanding why coups are more frequent in some countries than others. The critical question is: Can we establish a method to help scholars focus on the most relevant factors of coups, rather than sifting through over 100 variables without reaching a consensus?\nReviewing previously proposed variables of coups, it is evident that all focus on pre-coup conditions, with no consideration given to post-coup factors. However, coups are high-stakes gambles with an all-or-nothing nature. As defined by J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011), coups are “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive” (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011, 252). Due to their illegality, the consequences of a failed coup can be severe, with perpetrators risking imprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators. Therefore, no coup plotters would stage a coup without some assurance of success.\nHistorical coup attempts and their success rates provide valuable insights. Despite the significant risks associated with coups since 1950, as shown in Table 2, there have been 491 coups worldwide. Importantly, about half of these coups have been successful. At first glance, coups appear to be a high-success-rate political venture. However, compared to over 12,000 country-years since 1950, the occurrence of 491 coups is relatively rare, accounting for about 4% (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011).\n\nCodecoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt; \n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`, \n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;   \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt; \n  # cols_width(1 ~ px(120),\n  #            2:4 ~ px(88)\n  # ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate clearly indicate that the initiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring depends greatly on its potential success rate. Since coup plotters meticulously assess potential outcomes, we should also analyze what factors most affect these outcomes when discussing the key determinants of coups. This approach allows us to focus on the most relevant factors and disregard those less related.\nWhen considering the factors that most affect the outcomes of coups, the current literature predominantly identifies military power as the decisive factor in the success of coups. This necessitates an analysis of power dynamics within regimes, as military power is ultimately shaped by power dynamics.\nBecause coup attempts are self-selective rather than random, this study employs a double probit model with sample selection to examine factors influencing coup success rates and, consequently, the likelihood of coup attempts. I posit that regime type, by shaping internal power dynamics among coup plotters, incumbents, and other ruling elites, is a crucial determinant of coup likelihood.\nThis study makes two key contributions to the existing literature. First, it underscores the importance of regime type as a crucial determinant of coup attempts. Previous studies often treat regime type as a control variable, overlooking that variations in many other variables are fundamentally rooted in different regime types. More importantly, this study establishes a systematic approach for identifying the most relevant factors, thereby avoiding sifting through over 100 variables.\nThe subsequent sections of this paper explore the dynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. In Part 3, I detail the research design, outlining the methodology and variables used in the analysis. Part 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Finally, Part 5 concludes the study, summarizing the key insights and their implications.\nhttps://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/coup_data/home.htm, accessed on 2024-06-14"

    "section": "\n2 Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes",
    "text": "2 Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\nCoup attempts are driven by a complex interplay of factors, with two key elements attracting significant scholarly attention: disposition (the motivations behind the attempt) and capability (the resources and opportunities to succeed).\n\n2.1 Motivations for coups\nThis section focuses on disposition, exploring the primary motivations that compel individuals to undertake the significant risks associated with a coup. We can categorize coup motivations into three main types:\nPersonal Ambition: The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth is a significant motivator for some coup plotters. For example, Wintrobe (2019) distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on their use of power. While both prioritize personal gain, totalitarian leaders seek complete control over every aspect of society, whereas tinpot leaders focus on enriching themselves through extravagant lifestyles.\nPurported National Interest: Coups are sometimes justified as necessary interventions to save a nation from crisis, uphold the constitution, or facilitate a transition to democracy. While scepticism is warranted due to the potential for self-serving justifications, legitimate cases do exist. For instance, the 2010 coup in Niger ousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term by dissolving the opposing court and calling a self-serving referendum (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019).\nSelf-Preservation: In some instances, coups are pre-emptive strikes against imminent political persecution or repression. Coup leaders might not be motivated by a desire for power, but rather a fear of elimination by the incumbent regime. A notable example is Idi Amin’s 1971 coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his military command position (Sudduth 2017).\nThese motivations can arise in any regime, but autocracies are particularly susceptible, especially for coups framed under the guise of national interest or self-preservation. Stable democracies, on the other hand, rarely face the same level of constitutional crises or political persecution that might necessitate a coup. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and democratic backsliding, creating opportunities for coup plotters to exploit these weaknesses and justify their actions.\nDespite the potential motivations outlined above, coups remain relatively uncommon events, occurring in only about 4% of country-years since 1950. This low frequency highlights the importance of the second key element – capability. Even the most motivated plotters require the resources and opportunities to succeed. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure; the next section will explore the concept of capability in greater detail.\n\n2.2 Capability for coups\nWhile many ambitious individuals may covet supreme power, only a select few possess the capability to orchestrate a successful coup. This capability hinges not just on their desire, but on overcoming inherent disadvantages compared to the incumbent leaders.\nFirstly, coups are inherently clandestine operations due to their illegality. Plotters require a tight-knit group to minimize leaks and maximize the element of surprise. This secrecy restricts their ability to openly recruit supporters, a privilege enjoyed by incumbents who can implement “coup-proofing” measures.\nSecondly, coup plotters face uncertainty about the reactions of other powerful factions within the regime, those who could tip the scales of power. Incumbents, however, have a deeper understanding of these dynamics and proactively work to solidify their own position. While they may not know who exactly might attempt a coup, they are attuned to potential threats and adapt their strategies accordingly.\nThirdly, coup plotters face a significant challenge in securing unwavering loyalty from potential co-conspirators. The risks associated with a coup are substantial, with uncertain rewards even in the event of success. Promises made by coup leaders might not be kept, and post-coup purges are a common tactic to eliminate future coup threats. Defecting to the incumbent leader can often be a safer option, offering predictable rewards and less risk.\nGiven these inherent obstacles, rational coup plotters are unlikely to gamble on a low-probability attempt. They may choose to abandon their plans altogether or bide their time for a more opportune timing. Therefore, when coup plotters do take action, it is because they have meticulously assessed their chances of success and believe the risks are outweighed by the potential gains.\nBut what is the threshold for a “good enough” chance of success? Before diving into a theoretical framework, let’s examine historical data to gain some perspective. Surprisingly, coups since 1950 boast a rather high success rate, with nearly half ending in victory (as shown in Table 2).\n\n2.3 Framework of coup success\nAn oft-cited framework (Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt 2016; Aidt and Leon 2019) provides a structured approach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of coups can be represented by the equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(1)\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf B\\) represents the return of a successful coup, \\(\\mathbf C\\) signifies the cost of a failed coup, and \\(p\\) represents the probability of coup success. The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B &gt; (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(2)\\]\nEquation 2 implies that for Equation 1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from successful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups.\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying \\(\\mathbf B\\) (the value of a successful coup) and \\(\\mathbf C\\) (the cost of failure) is difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after a successful coup, are intangible concepts that defy precise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup in Ghana1, the fate of the coup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high likely to be killed if the coup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds.\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core logic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the return and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive nature of precise values for \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), they can be treated as roughly equal. Consequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and compare these values precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), to the probability of success (\\(p\\)), simplifying Equation 2 to:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np &gt; (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(3)\\]\nEquation 3 suggests that, to hold Equation 2 true, a success probability greater than \\(50\\%\\) is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat supports this notion. As shown in Table 2, the overall success rate is \\(49.9\\%\\). While this falls short of the \\(50\\%\\) threshold, it’s important to consider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily reflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly, outliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not prioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can propose our first hypothesis:\n\nH1: The fundamental determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup’s success, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary, the core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the incumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage in this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n2.4 Regime types and power dynamics\nMilitary strength undeniably plays a critical role in coup attempts. Control of the armed forces offers a significant advantage, explaining why military coups dominate discussions on the topic. Much of the literature treats “coup” and “military coup” interchangeably, with scholars like J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011) finding half of 14 studies attribute coups solely to the military. Consequently, significant focus, from both researchers and policymakers, centers on the balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military factions themselves. Strategies like “keeping the military content” (Aidt and Leon 2019) or “providing them with resources” (Huntington 1991) aim to reduce military intervention. Empirical research informs coup-proofing strategies that either decrease the military’s desire for coups or raise barriers to success (Leon 2013; J. Powell et al. 2018).\nHowever, while military power is decisive, previous literature often oversimplifies its nature. As Table 4 will demonstrate, military regimes, despite concentrated military control, exhibit surprising instability. Military regimes experience most frequent coup attempts. This highlights a crucial oversight: the intra-military component. Treating the military as a monolithic entity ignores the complex internal dynamics (Singh 2016). Regardless of size, any military comprises diverse groups with their own hierarchies, fostering suspicion, competition, and vigilance rather than unity. The clandestine nature of coups necessitates small, secretive groups. Plotters are unsure of other factions’ stances and fear their opposition or intervention, as exemplified by the swiftly thwarted 2021 Niger coup2. The success of a coup hinges heavily on other military factions’ reactions (Geddes 1999).\nFurthermore, the relationship between government and military varies across regimes. In democracies, civilian authority reigns supreme. The military is a national institution bound by the constitution, not individual leaders, ensuring political neutrality (e.g., the U.S. Armed Forces). Conversely, non-democracies display a less clear power structure. Identifying the true leader of the military depends on the regime type. We will leverage framework of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) to categorize autocracies based on leadership origin and decision-making. This framework classifies regimes into three main categories: military, personalist, and dominant-party.\nMilitary regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta – a group of military officers who control the regime’s power structure, including leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the Brazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the Salvadoran regime (1948-1984) (Geddes 1999). In personalist regimes, power resides with a single, charismatic leader who controls policy, the military, and succession. Regimes like Rafael Trujillo’s in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin’s in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s in the Central African Republic (1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule (Geddes 1999). In dominant-party regimes, power rests within a well-organized ruling party, with leaders acting as its representatives. The party structure and ideology foster internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Examples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European countries (Geddes 1999).\nThe critical distinction between regime types lies in the unique power balance established during the initial power seizure. The most competent group, be it a military junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically prevails due to the challenges of seizing control. This power grab is often accompanied by purges of potential rivals, solidifying the newly established regime (Sudduth 2017; Roessler 2011).\nFollowing these internal purges and external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges, typically solidifying into one of three main structures: military regimes, personalist regimes, or dominant-party regimes.\n\nDominant-Party Regimes: These regimes boast the greatest stability due to their institutionalized structure. A dominant party, with its shared ideology and goals, fosters internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Power resides within the party, not with any single individual, and the military aligns with the party itself, contributing to greater stability. Formalized succession rules further bolster stability by ensuring a smooth transfer of power (Frantz and Stein 2016).\nPersonalist Regimes: These regimes exhibit a degree of initial stability as dictators, having emerged from intense competition, are typically tough and competent. The purging of rivals creates a temporary status quo within the dictator’s inner circle. However, the lack of a clear succession plan creates a vulnerability. The dictator’s sudden death can plunge the regime into chaos, as potential successors scramble for power, creating a prime opportunity for coups.\nMilitary Regimes: These regimes are often the least stable. Power is typically shared among a junta, leading to mistrust and internal conflicts over benefits and policies. The absence of a single authority figure hinders decisive action, as exemplified by the power struggles within the Chilean junta after the 1973 coup (Arriagada Herrera 1988).\n\n\nCoderead.csv(here(\"data/regimes_comparison.csv\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(institutionalized_leadership_succession = percent(institutionalized_leadership_succession)) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    4 ~ px(180),\n    3 ~ px(80),\n    1:2 ~ px(30)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GWF & Author*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Main features of different types of regimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCenter of Power\nInstitutionalized Leadership Succession\nPower Transition\n\n\n\nMilitary\nJunta\n59%\nBased on agreement among junta members\n\n\nPersonalist\nDictator\n77%\nDependent on dictator’s health or lifepan\n\n\nDominant-party\nParty\n97%\nStructured by the party’s institutional frameworks\n\n\n\nSource: GWF & Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese contrasting power dynamics significantly influence a regime’s susceptibility to coups. As Table 4 confirms, military regimes, despite representing only 5.6% of country-years, experience a disproportionate share of coups (over 22%). Personalist regimes follow a similar pattern, facing a higher coup risk (23% of coups) despite constituting only 13% of country-years. Conversely, dominant-party regimes, with their institutionalized structures and unified leadership, exhibit the greatest resilience. They represent 22.6% of country-years but experience a lower incidence of coups (only 16.7%).\n\nCoderegimes &lt;- REIGN |&gt;\n  distinct(reign_cowcode, year, .keep_all = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    regime_type = case_when(\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\n        \"party-based\",\n        \"party-personal\",\n        \"party-military\",\n        \"party-personal-military\",\n        \"oligarchy\"\n      ) ~ \"dominant-party\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"personal\" ~ \"personal\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"military\", \"military personal\", \"indirect military\") ~ \"military\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"monarchy\" ~ \"monarchy\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"presidential\", \"parliamentary\") ~ \"democracy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1949)\n\nregime_total &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime_type) |&gt; \n  arrange(-n) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(country_year =n,\n         share = percent(percent),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n  \n\ncoup1 &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  select(country, ccode, year, coup)\n\ncoup_by_regime &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(num_of_coups = n,\n         percent_of_coups = percent(percent,accuracy = 0.1),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n\ncoup_by_succeed &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup),\n         coup == 2) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  select(regime, succeeded_coup = n) \n\ncoup_regimes &lt;-  coup_by_regime |&gt; \n  left_join(coup_by_succeed) |&gt; \n  mutate(success_rate = percent(succeeded_coup / num_of_coups, accuracy = 0.1))\n\nregime_total |&gt;\n  left_join(coup_regimes, join_by(regime_type == regime)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime_type = str_to_title(regime_type)) |&gt;\n  select(-succeeded_coup) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Regime types and coups since 1950\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCountry Year\nShare\nNum of Coups\nPercent of Coups\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n5303\n46.7%\n122\n24.8%\n51.6%\n\n\nDominant-Party\n2569\n22.6%\n82\n16.7%\n53.7%\n\n\nPersonal\n1477\n13.0%\n113\n23.0%\n44.2%\n\n\nMonarchy\n1056\n9.3%\n25\n5.1%\n56.0%\n\n\nMilitary\n638\n5.6%\n110\n22.4%\n48.2%\n\n\nOther\n322\n2.8%\n39\n7.9%\n53.8%\n\n\nTotal\n11365\n100.0%\n491\n100.0%\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: REIGN and GIC Datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are more prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes are the least likely to experience coups among the three.\n\nIn the case of the Ghanaian coup, flight lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings narrowly avoided execution after his initial failure, being freed by mutinous soldiers.

    "section": "\n3 Research Design",
    "text": "3 Research Design\n\n3.1 Double probit with sample selection model\nThis study employs a sophisticated statistical approach to account for the selective nature of coup attempts. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes (as discussed previously), success rates tend to be surprisingly consistent, hovering around 50% (as shown in Table 4). This suggests that coup attempts are not random acts, but rather strategically planned and undertaken only when the odds of success appear favourable. A standard statistical model would not account for this selectivity, potentially leading to biased results.\nTo address this issue, we utilize a two-stage sample selection model, similar to the approach used by J. Powell (2012). This model has two parts:\n\nSelection Equation (Stage 1): This stage analyzes the factors influencing whether a coup attempt occurs in a particular regime. The primary explanatory variable here is regime type, as previously discussed. Additional control variables may also be included, denoted by \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\).\nOutcome Equation (Stage 2): This stage focuses on the probability of success for those coup attempts that actually take place.\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are regime types, as previously discussed. Control variables are included in \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\). The selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt occurs and can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1^*=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XA} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(4)\\]\nHere, \\({y_1}^*\\) is an unobserved variable, which may be known to coup plotters. \\(Regime_i\\) is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or dominant-party). \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\) captures other control variables, such as the economic crisis index, previous coups, military expenditure, etc.\nThe observed binary outcome \\(\\mathbf{y_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_1^*&gt;0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_1^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the first stage, if \\(y_1^*\\le0\\), no coup attempt occurs in a given country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable does not reach the threshold. If \\(y_1^*&gt;0\\), at least one coup attempt is made in a country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable surpasses the threshold. The probability is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_1 =1)&=Prob(y_{1}^*&gt;0) \\\\\n&=\\Phi(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XA})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(5)\\]\nSimilarly, the outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup attempt is successful, given that it occurs:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2^*=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XB} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(6)\\]\nThe observed outcome \\(y_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_2^*&gt;0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_2^*\\le0$ (coup fails)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe probability equations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_2=1|y_1 =1)=\\Phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XB})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\qquad(7)\\]\n\n3.2 Variables\n\n3.2.1 Dependent variable\nOur analysis utilizes data on coup attempts and outcomes from J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011). A successful coup is defined as one where the incumbent leader is removed from power for more than seven days. The dataset covers the period from 1950 to 2023 and includes information on 491 coup attempts, with roughly half (245) being successful. Descriptive statistics for these coup attempts and regime types can be found in Table 2 and Table 4.\n\n3.2.2 Key Independent Variable: Regime Type\nThe core variable of interest is regime type, categorized following the classification system of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF). We focus on military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included for comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in Table 4.\n\n3.2.3 Control variables\nOur control variables are chosen based on the research of Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016). They analyzed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic growth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are particularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance, political violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control variables.\nEconomic Performance: We measure economic performance using the current-trend (\\(CT\\)) ratio developed by Krishnarajan (2019). This ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher \\(CT\\) ratio indicates stronger economic performance. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022), lagged by one year to reflect the prior year’s economic impact. For a country \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\), the \\(CT\\) ratio is calculated as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPolitical Violence: We capture overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. This data comes from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall (Marshall 2005).\nPrevious coups: The number of previous coups in a country is included in the first-stage (selection) model to assess its influence on the likelihood of a coup attempt. However, it is excluded from the second-stage model (outcome) because the number of past coups may not directly impact the outcome of a specific coup attempt."

    "text": "4 Results and Discussion\n\n4.1 Interpretation and Discussion\nThe double probit model with sample selection, estimated using the sampleSelection package in R, offers valuable insights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types (Table \\(\\ref{results}\\)).\nAs expected, military and personalist regimes are significantly more likely to experience coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes (all coefficients positive and significant at the 1% level). This aligns with our theoretical expectations regarding the internal power struggles within military juntas and the vulnerability of personalist regimes during succession crises. These findings highlight the importance of regime structure in understanding coup likelihood.\nThe control variables show the expected effects. Stronger economic performance (higher economic trend and GDP per capita) is associated with a lower risk of coups. Interestingly, the number of previous coups has a negative coefficient, suggesting a possible deterrent effect. However, this finding is not substantially significant. Overall, even after considering these factors, regime type remains a significant determinant of coup attempts, underscoring the robustness of the model.\nMost coefficients in the coup outcome equation are not statistically significant. This supports the hypothesis that coup attempts are strategically planned and undertaken only when the perceived chance of success is high. The selection process (whether a coup attempt occurs) seems to play a more critical role than these variables in determining the outcome. The negative and significant coefficient for GDP per capita suggests that stronger economies may bolster support for incumbents, making successful coups less likely.\nThe correlation coefficient (\\(\\rho\\)) between the error terms is positive (0.709) but not statistically significant (p-value = 0.445). While a positive correlation might suggest that factors increasing coup attempts also increasing their success, the lack of statistical significance weakens this connection. This finding implies that selection bias, while present, may not be as strong as initially anticipated.\nThe results strongly support the choice of the sample selection model. Significant coefficients with theoretically consistent directions suggest the model effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. Regime types with weaker institutional structures are more vulnerable to coup attempts, while better economic conditions make coups less likely overall. The model effectively addresses the non-random nature of coup attempts by treating selection and outcome as separate processes.\nThe observed disparity between coup attempt rates and success rates across regimes points towards selection bias, further validating the use of the sample selection model. This model acknowledges that coups are not random events, but rather strategic actions undertaken when the odds appear favourable.\nTo summary, the double probit model with sample selection proves to be a well-suited approach for this research. It provides robust insights into the factors influencing both the likelihood of coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types. The findings highlight the crucial role of regime structure and the selective nature of coup attempts, supporting the theoretical framework and empirical strategy employed in this study."

    "section": "\n5 Conclusion",
    "text": "5 Conclusion\nMotivated by the lack of consensus despite numerous empirical studies on the determinants of coups, this study introduces a novel approach that prioritizes determinants based on their impact on coup success. By analysing coup success rates, the study hypothesizes that the expected outcomes of coups are critical determinants of their occurrence. Utilizing a double probit model with sample selection, I investigate and confirm the relationship between regime types and coup attempts.\nThe findings suggest that regime type plays a significant role in the likelihood of coup attempts. Military and personalist regimes, characterized by weaker institutional frameworks and higher vulnerability during power transitions, are more susceptible to coups. This underscores the importance of supporting initiatives that strengthen constitutional institutions within these regimes.\nThe research also finds that stronger economic performance is associated with a lower risk of coups, suggesting that policies promoting economic development can be effective in reducing coup risk.\nThe study shows that the most efficient coup-proofing strategies involve the establishment of strong institutions. In contrast, purges, random shifting of military officers, or increased military expenditures are less effective. However, few autocratic leaders, particularly dictators or military juntas, are willing to institutionalize their regimes, as such reforms may constrain their power or shorten their terms. While institutions benefit the regime, they do not necessarily benefit the leaders themselves.\nFuture research could explore specific institutional reforms that are most effective in improving stability across different regimes.\n\n\n\n\nCan.Do.So\n\n\n\n\nAidt, Toke, and Gabriel Leon. 2019. “The Coup.” Edited by Roger D.

According to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC)1 dataset (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011), Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between \\(1950\\) and \\(1984\\), while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar time frame. However, Mexico’s authoritarian period from \\(1917\\) to \\(2000\\) saw no coups at all. In Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between \\(1955\\) and \\(2023\\), whereas South Africa has not experienced any coup since \\(1950\\). Similar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia.\nThe varying frequency of coup attempts has captivated political scientists for decades, leading to extensive research on the subject. As highlighted by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), despite approximately one hundred potential determinants of coups being suggested, no consensus has been reached. In an effort to address this issue, Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016) tested 66 factors proposed in previous literature using three million model permutations in an extreme bounds analysis.\nExamining previous research, which has tested around 100 variables as potential determinants of coups, raises an important question beyond simply understanding why coups are more frequent in some countries than others. The critical question is: Can we establish a method to help scholars focus on the most relevant factors of coups, rather than sifting through over 100 variables without reaching a consensus?\nReviewing previously proposed variables of coups, it is evident that all focus on pre-coup conditions, with no consideration given to post-coup factors. However, coups are high-stakes gambles with an all-or-nothing nature. As defined by J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011), coups are “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive” (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011, 252). Due to their illegality, the consequences of a failed coup can be severe, with perpetrators risking imprisonment, exile, or even death. In some instances, repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators. Therefore, no coup plotters would stage a coup without some assurance of success.\nHistorical coup attempts and their success rates provide valuable insights. Despite the significant risks associated with coups since 1950, as shown in Table 2, there have been 491 coups worldwide. Importantly, about half of these coups have been successful. At first glance, coups appear to be a high-success-rate political venture. However, compared to over 12,000 country-years since 1950, the occurrence of 491 coups is relatively rare, accounting for about 4% (J. M. Powell and Thyne 2011).\n\nCodecoups |&gt;\n  # add one row which adds up the total\n  arrange(desc(`Coup attempted`)) |&gt;\n  head(11) |&gt; \n  add_row(\n    country = \"Total\",\n    `Coup attempted` = sum(coups[, 2]),\n    `Coup succeeded` = sum(coups[, 3])\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(Success_rate = percent(`Coup succeeded` / `Coup attempted`, \n                                accuracy = 0.1\n                                )) |&gt;   \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(\n    table.width = pct(90),\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\"\n              ) |&gt; \n  # cols_width(1 ~ px(120),\n  #            2:4 ~ px(88)\n  # ) |&gt;\n  cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = 2:3\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GIC dataset*\"))\n\n\nTable 2: Top 10 countries with the most coup attempts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCoup Attempted\nCoup Succeeded\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nBolivia\n23\n11\n47.8%\n\n\nArgentina\n20\n7\n35.0%\n\n\nSudan\n17\n6\n35.3%\n\n\nHaiti\n13\n9\n69.2%\n\n\nVenezuela\n13\n0\n0.0%\n\n\nIraq\n12\n4\n33.3%\n\n\nSyria\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nThailand\n12\n8\n66.7%\n\n\nEcuador\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nBurundi\n11\n5\n45.5%\n\n\nGuatemala\n10\n5\n50.0%\n\n\nTotal\n491\n245\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: GIC dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe low occurrence rate and high success rate clearly indicate that the initiation of coups is highly selective. In other words, the likelihood of a coup occurring depends greatly on its potential success rate. Since coup plotters meticulously assess potential outcomes, we should also analyze what factors most affect these outcomes when discussing the key determinants of coups. This approach allows us to focus on the most relevant factors and disregard those less related.\nWhen considering the factors that most affect the outcomes of coups, the current literature predominantly identifies military power as the decisive factor in the success of coups. This necessitates an analysis of power dynamics within regimes, as military power is ultimately shaped by power dynamics.\nBecause coup attempts are self-selective rather than random, this study employs a double probit model with sample selection to examine factors influencing coup success rates and, consequently, the likelihood of coup attempts. I posit that regime type, by shaping internal power dynamics among coup plotters, incumbents, and other ruling elites, is a crucial determinant of coup likelihood.\nThis study makes two key contributions to the existing literature. First, it underscores the importance of regime type as a crucial determinant of coup attempts. Previous studies often treat regime type as a control variable, overlooking that variations in many other variables are fundamentally rooted in different regime types. More importantly, this study establishes a systematic approach for identifying the most relevant factors, thereby avoiding sifting through over 100 variables.\nThe subsequent sections of this paper explore the dynamics of coup attempts and their outcomes. In Part 3, I detail the research design, outlining the methodology and variables used in the analysis. Part 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings. Finally, Part 5 concludes the study, summarizing the key insights and their implications."

    "text": "2 Dynamics of coup attempts and outcomes\nCoup attempts are driven by a complex interplay of factors, with two key elements attracting significant scholarly attention: disposition (the motivations behind the attempt) and capability (the resources and opportunities to succeed).\n\n2.1 Motivations for coups\nThis section focuses on disposition, exploring the primary motivations that compel individuals to undertake the significant risks associated with a coup. We can categorize coup motivations into three main types:\nPersonal Ambition: The allure of absolute power, prestige, and wealth is a significant motivator for some coup plotters. For example, Wintrobe (2019) distinguishes between totalitarian and tinpot dictators based on their use of power. While both prioritize personal gain, totalitarian leaders seek complete control over every aspect of society, whereas tinpot leaders focus on enriching themselves through extravagant lifestyles.\nPurported National Interest: Coups are sometimes justified as necessary interventions to save a nation from crisis, uphold the constitution, or facilitate a transition to democracy. While scepticism is warranted due to the potential for self-serving justifications, legitimate cases do exist. For instance, the 2010 coup in Niger ousted President Tandja, who attempted an unconstitutional third term by dissolving the opposing court and calling a self-serving referendum (Ginsburg and Elkins 2019).\nSelf-Preservation: In some instances, coups are pre-emptive strikes against imminent political persecution or repression. Coup leaders might not be motivated by a desire for power, but rather a fear of elimination by the incumbent regime. A notable example is Idi Amin’s 1971 coup against Ugandan President Obote, who was attempting to remove Amin from his military command position (Sudduth 2017).\nThese motivations can arise in any regime, but autocracies are particularly susceptible, especially for coups framed under the guise of national interest or self-preservation. Stable democracies, on the other hand, rarely face the same level of constitutional crises or political persecution that might necessitate a coup. However, new democracies can be vulnerable to instability, economic downturns, and democratic backsliding, creating opportunities for coup plotters to exploit these weaknesses and justify their actions.\nDespite the potential motivations outlined above, coups remain relatively uncommon events, occurring in only about 4% of country-years since 1950. This low frequency highlights the importance of the second key element – capability. Even the most motivated plotters require the resources and opportunities to succeed. No rational actor attempts a guaranteed failure; the next section will explore the concept of capability in greater detail.\n\n2.2 Capability for coups\nWhile many ambitious individuals may covet supreme power, only a select few possess the capability to orchestrate a successful coup. This capability hinges not just on their desire, but on overcoming inherent disadvantages compared to the incumbent leaders.\nFirstly, coups are inherently clandestine operations due to their illegality. Plotters require a tight-knit group to minimize leaks and maximize the element of surprise. This secrecy restricts their ability to openly recruit supporters, a privilege enjoyed by incumbents who can implement “coup-proofing” measures.\nSecondly, coup plotters face uncertainty about the reactions of other powerful factions within the regime, those who could tip the scales of power. Incumbents, however, have a deeper understanding of these dynamics and proactively work to solidify their own position. While they may not know who exactly might attempt a coup, they are attuned to potential threats and adapt their strategies accordingly.\nThirdly, coup plotters face a significant challenge in securing unwavering loyalty from potential co-conspirators. The risks associated with a coup are substantial, with uncertain rewards even in the event of success. Promises made by coup leaders might not be kept, and post-coup purges are a common tactic to eliminate future coup threats. Defecting to the incumbent leader can often be a safer option, offering predictable rewards and less risk.\nGiven these inherent obstacles, rational coup plotters are unlikely to gamble on a low-probability attempt. They may choose to abandon their plans altogether or bide their time for a more opportune timing. Therefore, when coup plotters do take action, it is because they have meticulously assessed their chances of success and believe the risks are outweighed by the potential gains.\nBut what is the threshold for a “good enough” chance of success? Before diving into a theoretical framework, let’s examine historical data to gain some perspective. Surprisingly, coups since 1950 boast a rather high success rate, with nearly half ending in victory (as shown in Table 2).\n\n2.3 Framework of coup success\nAn oft-cited framework (Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt 2016; Aidt and Leon 2019) provides a structured approach to assess the disposition and capability of coup attempts by evaluating the anticipated benefits for coup plotters. The expected payoff of coups can be represented by the equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(U) = p \\times B + (1 - p) \\times (-C)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nHere, \\(\\mathbf B\\) represents the return of a successful coup, \\(\\mathbf C\\) signifies the cost of a failed coup, and \\(p\\) represents the probability of coup success. The condition for staging a coup is when the expected benefit is positive, meaning that the expected pay-off is greater than 0. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np \\times B &gt; (1 - p) \\times C\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nEquation 2 implies that for Equation 1 to hold, the expected benefits earned from successful coups must outweigh the expected cost of failed coups.\nWhile seemingly clear, the equation faces practical challenges. Quantifying \\(\\mathbf B\\) (the value of a successful coup) and \\(\\mathbf C\\) (the cost of failure) is difficult. The loss of life, freedom, or loved ones after a failed coup, as well as the value of assuming leadership after a successful coup, are intangible concepts that defy precise measurement. As evidenced by the 1979 coup in Ghana2, the fate of the coup leader(s) hangs in the balance; they are high likely to be killed if the coup fails, or to execute others if the coup succeeds.\nHowever, these challenges do not render the framework useless. Firstly, its core logic remains valuable, offering insights into how coup plotters might assess the return and cost of their actions. Secondly, given the significant and elusive nature of precise values for \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), they can be treated as roughly equal. Consequently, there is no need to fret over how to measure and compare these values precisely. Instead, we can shift our focus from \\(\\mathbf B\\) and \\(\\mathbf C\\), to the probability of success (\\(p\\)), simplifying Equation 2 to:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np &gt; (1-p)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nEquation 3 suggests that, to hold Equation 2 true, a success probability greater than \\(50\\%\\) is necessary. Interestingly, empirical data on coups since 1950 somewhat supports this notion. As shown in Table 2, the overall success rate is \\(49.9\\%\\). While this falls short of the \\(50\\%\\) threshold, it’s important to consider two factors. Firstly, this is an average rate, not necessarily reflective of the probabilities assessed by coup plotters beforehand. Secondly, outliers such as irrational actors and coups driven by self-preservation may not prioritize success probabilities. Taking these points into account, we can propose our first hypothesis:\n\nH1: The fundamental determinant of a coup attempt is the perceived chance of success. Coup plotters likely require a success threshold of at least 50%.\n\nThis leads us to the next crucial question: what factors determine a coup’s success, influencing the very decision to attempt one? While specifics may vary, the core element hinges on the power dynamic between coup plotters and the incumbent leaders. Logically, the more powerful entity holds a greater advantage in this high-stakes struggle for control.\n\n2.4 Regime types and power dynamics\nMilitary strength undeniably plays a critical role in coup attempts. Control of the armed forces offers a significant advantage, explaining why military coups dominate discussions on the topic. Much of the literature treats “coup” and “military coup” interchangeably, with scholars like J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011) finding half of 14 studies attribute coups solely to the military. Consequently, significant focus, from both researchers and policymakers, centers on the balance of power between civilian and military authorities, or among military factions themselves. Strategies like “keeping the military content” (Aidt and Leon 2019) or “providing them with resources” (Huntington 1991) aim to reduce military intervention. Empirical research informs coup-proofing strategies that either decrease the military’s desire for coups or raise barriers to success (Leon 2013; J. Powell et al. 2018).\nHowever, while military power is decisive, previous literature often oversimplifies its nature. As Table 4 will demonstrate, military regimes, despite concentrated military control, exhibit surprising instability. Military regimes experience most frequent coup attempts. This highlights a crucial oversight: the intra-military component. Treating the military as a monolithic entity ignores the complex internal dynamics (Singh 2016). Regardless of size, any military comprises diverse groups with their own hierarchies, fostering suspicion, competition, and vigilance rather than unity. The clandestine nature of coups necessitates small, secretive groups. Plotters are unsure of other factions’ stances and fear their opposition or intervention, as exemplified by the swiftly thwarted 2021 Niger coup3. The success of a coup hinges heavily on other military factions’ reactions (Geddes 1999).\nFurthermore, the relationship between government and military varies across regimes. In democracies, civilian authority reigns supreme. The military is a national institution bound by the constitution, not individual leaders, ensuring political neutrality (e.g., the U.S. Armed Forces). Conversely, non-democracies display a less clear power structure. Identifying the true leader of the military depends on the regime type. We will leverage framework of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) to categorize autocracies based on leadership origin and decision-making. This framework classifies regimes into three main categories: military, personalist, and dominant-party.\nMilitary regimes are characterized by the dominance of a junta – a group of military officers who control the regime’s power structure, including leadership selection and policy formulation. Examples include the Brazilian regime (1964-1985), the Argentine regime (1976-1983), and the Salvadoran regime (1948-1984) (Geddes 1999). In personalist regimes, power resides with a single, charismatic leader who controls policy, the military, and succession. Regimes like Rafael Trujillo’s in the Dominican Republic (1930-1961), Idi Amin’s in Uganda (1971-1979), and Jean-Bédel Bokassa’s in the Central African Republic (1966-1979) exemplify personalist rule (Geddes 1999). In dominant-party regimes, power rests within a well-organized ruling party, with leaders acting as its representatives. The party structure and ideology foster internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Examples include the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) in Mexico, the Revolutionary Party of Tanzania (CCM), and Leninist parties in various Eastern European countries (Geddes 1999).\nThe critical distinction between regime types lies in the unique power balance established during the initial power seizure. The most competent group, be it a military junta, a political party, or a strongman, typically prevails due to the challenges of seizing control. This power grab is often accompanied by purges of potential rivals, solidifying the newly established regime (Sudduth 2017; Roessler 2011).\nFollowing these internal purges and external challenges, a new power dynamic emerges, typically solidifying into one of three main structures: military regimes, personalist regimes, or dominant-party regimes.\n\nDominant-Party Regimes: These regimes boast the greatest stability due to their institutionalized structure. A dominant party, with its shared ideology and goals, fosters internal cohesion and a long-term vision. Power resides within the party, not with any single individual, and the military aligns with the party itself, contributing to greater stability. Formalized succession rules further bolster stability by ensuring a smooth transfer of power (Frantz and Stein 2016).\nPersonalist Regimes: These regimes exhibit a degree of initial stability as dictators, having emerged from intense competition, are typically tough and competent. The purging of rivals creates a temporary status quo within the dictator’s inner circle. However, the lack of a clear succession plan creates a vulnerability. The dictator’s sudden death can plunge the regime into chaos, as potential successors scramble for power, creating a prime opportunity for coups.\nMilitary Regimes: These regimes are often the least stable. Power is typically shared among a junta, leading to mistrust and internal conflicts over benefits and policies. The absence of a single authority figure hinders decisive action, as exemplified by the power struggles within the Chilean junta after the 1973 coup (Arriagada Herrera 1988).\n\n\nCoderead.csv(here(\"data/regimes_comparison.csv\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(institutionalized_leadership_succession = percent(institutionalized_leadership_succession)) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  cols_width(\n    4 ~ px(180),\n    3 ~ px(80),\n    1:2 ~ px(30)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: GWF & Author*\"))\n\n\nTable 3: Main features of different types of regimes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCenter of Power\nInstitutionalized Leadership Succession\nPower Transition\n\n\n\nMilitary\nJunta\n59%\nBased on agreement among junta members\n\n\nPersonalist\nDictator\n77%\nDependent on dictator’s health or lifepan\n\n\nDominant-party\nParty\n97%\nStructured by the party’s institutional frameworks\n\n\n\nSource: GWF & Author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese contrasting power dynamics significantly influence a regime’s susceptibility to coups. As Table 4 confirms, military regimes, despite representing only 5.6% of country-years, experience a disproportionate share of coups (over 22%). Personalist regimes follow a similar pattern, facing a higher coup risk (23% of coups) despite constituting only 13% of country-years. Conversely, dominant-party regimes, with their institutionalized structures and unified leadership, exhibit the greatest resilience. They represent 22.6% of country-years but experience a lower incidence of coups (only 16.7%).\n\nCoderegimes &lt;- REIGN |&gt;\n  distinct(reign_cowcode, year, .keep_all = T) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    regime_type = case_when(\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\n        \"party-based\",\n        \"party-personal\",\n        \"party-military\",\n        \"party-personal-military\",\n        \"oligarchy\"\n      ) ~ \"dominant-party\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"personal\" ~ \"personal\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"military\", \"military personal\", \"indirect military\") ~ \"military\",\n      gwf_regimetype == \"monarchy\" ~ \"monarchy\",\n      gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"presidential\", \"parliamentary\") ~ \"democracy\",\n      TRUE ~ \"other\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1949)\n\nregime_total &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime_type) |&gt; \n  arrange(-n) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(country_year =n,\n         share = percent(percent),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n  \n\ncoup1 &lt;- coup |&gt;\n  select(country, ccode, year, coup)\n\ncoup_by_regime &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup)) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  mutate(num_of_coups = n,\n         percent_of_coups = percent(percent,accuracy = 0.1),\n         .keep = \"unused\") \n\ncoup_by_succeed &lt;- regimes |&gt;\n  select(ccode = reign_cowcode, extended_country_name, year, regime_type) |&gt;\n  full_join(coup1, by = join_by(ccode, year)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime = na.locf(regime_type, .by = ccode)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(coup),\n         coup == 2) |&gt;\n  tabyl(regime) |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt; \n  select(regime, succeeded_coup = n) \n\ncoup_regimes &lt;-  coup_by_regime |&gt; \n  left_join(coup_by_succeed) |&gt; \n  mutate(success_rate = percent(succeeded_coup / num_of_coups, accuracy = 0.1))\n\nregime_total |&gt;\n  left_join(coup_regimes, join_by(regime_type == regime)) |&gt;\n  mutate(regime_type = str_to_title(regime_type)) |&gt;\n  select(-succeeded_coup) |&gt; \n  clean_names(case = \"title\") |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_options(column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n              table.width = pct(100),\n              table.align = \"center\") |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"*Source: REIGN and GIC Datasets*\"))\n\n\nTable 4: Regime types and coups since 1950\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegime Type\nCountry Year\nShare\nNum of Coups\nPercent of Coups\nSuccess Rate\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n5303\n46.7%\n122\n24.8%\n51.6%\n\n\nDominant-Party\n2569\n22.6%\n82\n16.7%\n53.7%\n\n\nPersonal\n1477\n13.0%\n113\n23.0%\n44.2%\n\n\nMonarchy\n1056\n9.3%\n25\n5.1%\n56.0%\n\n\nMilitary\n638\n5.6%\n110\n22.4%\n48.2%\n\n\nOther\n322\n2.8%\n39\n7.9%\n53.8%\n\n\nTotal\n11365\n100.0%\n491\n100.0%\n49.9%\n\n\n\nSource: REIGN and GIC Datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2: Due to their balance of power dynamics, military regimes are more prone to coups, followed by personalist regimes, while dominant-party regimes are the least likely to experience coups among the three."

    "section": "\n3 Research Design",
    "text": "3 Research Design\n\n3.1 Double probit with sample selection model\nThis study employs a sophisticated statistical approach to account for the selective nature of coup attempts. While coup attempt rates vary across regimes (as discussed previously), success rates tend to be surprisingly consistent, hovering around 50% (as shown in Table 4). This suggests that coup attempts are not random acts, but rather strategically planned and undertaken only when the odds of success appear favourable. A standard statistical model would not account for this selectivity, potentially leading to biased results.\nTo address this issue, we utilize a two-stage sample selection model, similar to the approach used by J. Powell (2012). This model has two parts:\n\nSelection Equation (Stage 1): This stage analyzes the factors influencing whether a coup attempt occurs in a particular regime. The primary explanatory variable here is regime type, as previously discussed. Additional control variables may also be included, denoted by \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\).\nOutcome Equation (Stage 2): This stage focuses on the probability of success for those coup attempts that actually take place.\n\nThe primary explanatory variables are regime types, as previously discussed. Control variables are included in \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\). The selection equation (first stage) models the probability that a coup attempt occurs and can be expressed as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1^*=\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XA} + \\mu_{1i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nHere, \\({y_1}^*\\) is an unobserved variable, which may be known to coup plotters. \\(Regime_i\\) is a categorical variable (military, personalist, or dominant-party). \\(\\mathbf{XB}\\) captures other control variables, such as the economic crisis index, previous coups, military expenditure, etc.\nThe observed binary outcome \\(\\mathbf{y_1}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_1 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_1^*&gt;0$ (coup attempt occurs)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_1^*\\le0$ (no coup attempt)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the first stage, if \\(y_1^*\\le0\\), no coup attempt occurs in a given country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable does not reach the threshold. If \\(y_1^*&gt;0\\), at least one coup attempt is made in a country-year, indicating that the unobserved variable surpasses the threshold. The probability is expressed as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_1 =1)&=Prob(y_{1}^*&gt;0) \\\\\n&=\\Phi(\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XA})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nSimilarly, the outcome equation (second stage) models the probability that a coup attempt is successful, given that it occurs:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2^*=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf {XB} + \\mu_{2i}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe observed outcome \\(y_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_2 =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 &\\text{if $y_2^*&gt;0$ (coup succeeds)} \\\\\n0 &\\text{if $y_2^*\\le0$ (coup fails)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe probability equations is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nProb(y_2=1|y_1 =1)=\\Phi(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Regime_i + \\mathbf{XB})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7}\\]\n\n3.2 Variables\n\n3.2.1 Dependent variable\nOur analysis utilizes data on coup attempts and outcomes from J. M. Powell and Thyne (2011). A successful coup is defined as one where the incumbent leader is removed from power for more than seven days. The dataset covers the period from 1950 to 2023 and includes information on 491 coup attempts, with roughly half (245) being successful. Descriptive statistics for these coup attempts and regime types can be found in Table 2 and Table 4.\n\n3.2.2 Key Independent Variable: Regime Type\nThe core variable of interest is regime type, categorized following the classification system of Geddes, Wright, and Frantz (2014) (GWF). We focus on military, personalist, and dominant-party regimes, with democracies and monarchies included for comparison. Descriptive statistics for regime types are presented in Table 4.\n\n3.2.3 Control variables\nOur control variables are chosen based on the research of Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016). They analyzed 66 factors potentially influencing coups and found that slow economic growth, prior coup attempts, and other forms of political violence are particularly significant factors. Therefore, we include economic performance, political violence, and the number of previous coups as our main control variables.\nEconomic Performance: We measure economic performance using the current-trend (\\(CT\\)) ratio developed by Krishnarajan (2019). This ratio compares a country’s current GDP per capita to the average GDP per capita over the previous five years. A higher \\(CT\\) ratio indicates stronger economic performance. We use GDP per capita data (in constant 2017 international dollars, PPP) from the V-Dem dataset by Fariss et al. (2022), lagged by one year to reflect the prior year’s economic impact. For a country \\(i\\) at year \\(t\\), the \\(CT\\) ratio is calculated as follows: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nCT_{i,t} = {GDP/cap_{i,t} \\over {1 \\over 5} {\\sum_{k=1}^5GDP/cap_{i,t-k}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nPolitical Violence: We capture overall regime stability by including a violence index that encompasses all types of internal and interstate wars and violence. This data comes from the Major Episodes of Political Violence dataset by Marshall (Marshall 2005).\nPrevious coups: The number of previous coups in a country is included in the first-stage (selection) model to assess its influence on the likelihood of a coup attempt. However, it is excluded from the second-stage model (outcome) because the number of past coups may not directly impact the outcome of a specific coup attempt."

    "text": "4 Results and Discussion\n\n4.1 Interpretation and Discussion\nThe double probit model with sample selection, estimated using the sampleSelection package in R, offers valuable insights into the factors influencing coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types (Table \\(\\ref{results}\\)).\nAs expected, military and personalist regimes are significantly more likely to experience coup attempts compared to dominant-party regimes (all coefficients positive and significant at the 1% level). This aligns with our theoretical expectations regarding the internal power struggles within military juntas and the vulnerability of personalist regimes during succession crises. These findings highlight the importance of regime structure in understanding coup likelihood.\nThe control variables show the expected effects. Stronger economic performance (higher economic trend and GDP per capita) is associated with a lower risk of coups. Interestingly, the number of previous coups has a negative coefficient, suggesting a possible deterrent effect. However, this finding is not substantially significant. Overall, even after considering these factors, regime type remains a significant determinant of coup attempts, underscoring the robustness of the model.\nMost coefficients in the coup outcome equation are not statistically significant. This supports the hypothesis that coup attempts are strategically planned and undertaken only when the perceived chance of success is high. The selection process (whether a coup attempt occurs) seems to play a more critical role than these variables in determining the outcome. The negative and significant coefficient for GDP per capita suggests that stronger economies may bolster support for incumbents, making successful coups less likely.\nThe correlation coefficient (\\(\\rho\\)) between the error terms is positive (0.709) but not statistically significant (p-value = 0.445). While a positive correlation might suggest that factors increasing coup attempts also increasing their success, the lack of statistical significance weakens this connection. This finding implies that selection bias, while present, may not be as strong as initially anticipated.\nThe results strongly support the choice of the sample selection model. Significant coefficients with theoretically consistent directions suggest the model effectively captures key aspects of coup dynamics. Regime types with weaker institutional structures are more vulnerable to coup attempts, while better economic conditions make coups less likely overall. The model effectively addresses the non-random nature of coup attempts by treating selection and outcome as separate processes.\nThe observed disparity between coup attempt rates and success rates across regimes points towards selection bias, further validating the use of the sample selection model. This model acknowledges that coups are not random events, but rather strategic actions undertaken when the odds appear favourable.\nTo summary, the double probit model with sample selection proves to be a well-suited approach for this research. It provides robust insights into the factors influencing both the likelihood of coup attempts and their success rates across different regime types. The findings highlight the crucial role of regime structure and the selective nature of coup attempts, supporting the theoretical framework and empirical strategy employed in this study."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\nMotivated by the lack of consensus despite numerous empirical studies on the determinants of coups, this study introduces a novel approach that prioritizes determinants based on their impact on coup success. By analysing coup success rates, the study hypothesizes that the expected outcomes of coups are critical determinants of their occurrence. Utilizing a double probit model with sample selection, I investigate and confirm the relationship between regime types and coup attempts.\nThe findings suggest that regime type plays a significant role in the likelihood of coup attempts. Military and personalist regimes, characterized by weaker institutional frameworks and higher vulnerability during power transitions, are more susceptible to coups. This underscores the importance of supporting initiatives that strengthen constitutional institutions within these regimes.\nThe research also finds that stronger economic performance is associated with a lower risk of coups, suggesting that policies promoting economic development can be effective in reducing coup risk.\nThe study shows that the most efficient coup-proofing strategies involve the establishment of strong institutions. In contrast, purges, random shifting of military officers, or increased military expenditures are less effective. However, few autocratic leaders, particularly dictators or military juntas, are willing to institutionalize their regimes, as such reforms may constrain their power or shorten their terms. While institutions benefit the regime, they do not necessarily benefit the leaders themselves.\nFuture research could explore specific institutional reforms that are most effective in improving stability across different regimes."

    "section": "\n1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Research question\nIrregular power transitions, marked by a disregard for constitutional procedures, are a critical area of study in political science. They not only disrupt established rules but often require unconstitutional tactics to secure power. Furthermore, these transitions can inspire copycat behaviour among other ambitious leaders.\nDespite their central role in political science and the extensive research conducted on irregular power transitions, a long-standing question continues to intrigue political scientists: Why are some leaders ousted before their terms expire, while others complete their full terms or even overstay beyond their originally mandated limits? In other words, why do some leaders survive for decades while others last for only years, months, or even days? This dissertation focuses on this question and seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis, dedicated to understanding how leaders come to power through unconstitutional means and what factors determine the duration of a leader’s rule following an irregular ascent.\n\n1.2 Analyses on coups and autocoups in a general framework\nWhen discussing irregular power transitions, the concepts that often come to mind are irregular entries or exits, such as coups, assassinations, rebellions, protests, and foreign interventions. Among these methods, coups hold a prominent position due to their frequent occurrence. According to the Archigos dataset (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009), from 1945 to 2015, there were approximately 145 instances of irregular leader exits, with coups accounting for more than half (79 leaders). The often-cited coup dataset (Powell and Thyne 2011) records even more leaders (245 cases) removed by coups from 1950 to 2023.\nGiven their prevalence and substantial influence on political systems, coups have been extensively studied, particularly since 2000 (Thyne and Powell 2019). Consequently, the concept of a coup is comparatively clear and widely accepted in academic circles. Many scholars, including this study, follow the definition by Powell and Thyne (2011), which describes coups as “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive… [a coup is successful] if the perpetrators seize and hold power for at least seven days” (p. 252). Although debates persist, two elements are clear: first, the perpetrators are elites within the ruling group, and the victims of coups are incumbent executive leaders. Second, the strategy or aim of a coup involves completely removing the incumbents, not merely seizing part of their power or forcing them to concede on specific policies. Beyond defining coups, several datasets have been developed for quantitative analyses, such as the Global Instances of Coups (Powell and Thyne 2011), the Cline Centre Coup d’État Project Dataset (Peyton et al. 2024), and the Colpus Dataset (Chin, Carter, and Wright 2021). These datasets are well-developed and frequently used in political science research.\nHowever, irregular power transitions are not limited to irregular entries and exits but should also include irregular “overstays.” Using illegal means to overthrow an incumbent leader before their term expires is undoubtedly an irregular power transition. Similarly, an incumbent using illegitimate means to extend their term beyond term limits is also an irregular power transition.\nAlthough academic attention to irregular retention of power has increased since the 1990s, especially after Peru’s President Alberto Fujimori’s self-coup in 1992, it remains comparatively understudied and has several shortcomings. First, there is no universally accepted terminology for this “overstaying in power” type of irregular power transition, unlike the clear term “coup.” Consequently, various terms such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive coup are used by different scholars. This dissertation will use ‘autocoup’ to refer to this type of irregular power transition, which will be thoroughly discussed in Chapter 3. Second, there is no consensus on the definition of an autocoup. Existing definitions remain vague, often conflating power expansions and power extensions. For example, Cameron (1998) defines an autogolpe as a temporary suspension of the constitution and dissolution of Congress by the executive, who then rules by decree. This definition focuses on power expansion instead of power extension, leading to conceptual confusion and misalignment with the definition of a classic coup. Third, a consensus autocoup dataset is lacking. While several related datasets exist, as discussed by Baturo and Tolstrup (2022) in coding their Incumbent Takeover dataset, the terminologies, definitions, and coverage years vary, lacking wide acknowledgment and extensive academic exploration. In summary, autocoup has not been analysed in a comparative manner connected with coups.\nAnalysing coups and autocoups separately is less problematic. However, from a comprehensive framework perspective on irregular power transitions and leader survival, coups and autocoups should be, and can be, analysed within the same framework. Both coup and autocoup significantly influence democratic backsliding and are the most frequent means of irregular power transition. Furthermore, as both are called “coups,” classic coups and autocoups are very similar since a coup is launched to replace the current leader, while an autocoup is staged to replace the future leader.\n\n1.3 Academic Contributions\nThis study addresses a critical gap in the literature by offering a comprehensive framework for analysing both coups and autocoups, which are the most common forms of irregular power transitions. While existing research often examines these topics separately with varying terminologies, definitions, methods, and datasets, this dissertation integrates these elements to provide a unified perspective on irregular power transitions and leader survival.\nOur contributions are threefold:\n\nEmphasis on power dynamics and regime types: We highlight the significant role of power dynamics, particularly the influence of regime types, in determining the success and frequency of coup attempts. Our analysis underscores how the expected chances of coup success motivate such attempts, with military regimes being notably susceptible.\nRefined definition and novel dataset for autocoups: We introduce a refined definition of autocoups and develop a novel dataset covering events from 1945 to 2022. This enables a comparative analysis with classic coups, providing clearer insights into the nature and impact of autocoups on political systems.\nSurvival analysis of leaders from different entry modes: By applying survival analysis to existing coup data and our new autocoup dataset, we demonstrate how different modes of entry into power significantly affect leader survival. Our findings reveal that leaders who come to power through coups typically have shorter tenures and face higher removal risks compared to those who extend their rule through autocoups.\n\nOur analysis of irregular power transitions is particularly relevant to understanding democratic backsliding. These transitions violate democratic norms and disrupt the path towards stable democracy. Leaders who gain power through irregular means often employ undemocratic tactics, such as suppressing opposition, to consolidate their illegitimate hold on power. This creates a vicious cycle where the erosion of democratic institutions is both a cause and consequence of efforts to maintain power.\n\n1.4 Overview of the thesis\nThis study is structured into three main chapters beyond the introduction, each addressing key aspects of irregular power transitions and their implications for political stability and democratic processes.\nChapter 2 examines the determinants of classic coup attempts. While extensive research exists on coups, most studies focus on observable factors such as economic performance, political stability, previous coups, and coup-proofing strategies. This chapter, however, emphasizes the less observable but crucial factor of expected coup success chances, which has been often overlooked. Utilizing Heckman’s two-staged sample selection model, the analysis reveals that expected success rates significantly influence coup attempts. These success rates are primarily shaped by the balance of power between incumbents and challengers, which is largely determined by regime types. The findings indicate that military regimes face a much higher risk of coups compared to dominant-party regimes.\nChapter 3 focuses on the concept of autocoups, specifically on power extensions by incumbent leaders. It distinguishes autocoups from broader concepts like self-coups or executive coups by redefining them as instances where incumbent leaders refuse to transition power as mandated, thereby overstaying in office. Based on this refined definition, a novel dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2022 is introduced, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successes. The chapter includes case studies and empirical analyses that demonstrate the utility of this dataset for quantitative research, providing a basis for empirical analysis on autocoups.\nChapter 4 investigates how the method of power acquisition impacts the longevity of leaders who come to power through coups versus those who extend their rule through autocoups. The hypothesis is that the method of accession significantly affects leader tenure. Using the Cox proportional hazards model and a time-dependent Cox model, the chapter provides evidence of differing survival times between these two types of leaders. The results indicate that leaders who come to power through coups face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to those who extend their rule through autocoups. This finding highlights the implications for political stability and democratic processes, suggesting that the relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could incentivize incumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to democratic backsliding and the personalization of power.\nIn Chapter 5, the study concludes by summarizing the main findings, discussing policy implications, and acknowledging the limitations of the research. It also outlines directions for future research, emphasizing the need for further exploration of irregular power transitions, particularly coups and autocoups."

    "section": "\n2 Conclusion",
    "text": "2 Conclusion\n\n2.1 Main Findings\nThis study delves into the dynamics and implications of irregular power transitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. The findings illuminate the complex interplay between incumbents and challengers fighting for power.\nFirstly, our analysis reveals that the expected success rate of a coup attempt significantly influences its likelihood. This success rate is heavily influenced by the balance of power between the incumbent regime and challengers, which is largely determined by regime type. We find that military regimes, although with more control over their own military forces, face a higher risk of coups compared to dominant-party regimes.\nSecondly, the study introduces a redefined concept: the autocoup. Defined as an incumbent leader’s refusal to relinquish power as mandated, this research distinguishes autocoups from broader terms like self-coups. Based on this definition, we present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2022, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups. Case studies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset’s utility for quantitative research, providing a robust foundation for further analysis on autocoups.\nThirdly, employing survival analysis techniques, the study finds clear differences in leader longevity between those who come to power through coups and those who extend their rule through autocoups. The results indicate that coup-installed leaders face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to autocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend their rule.\n\n2.2 Policy Implications\nThe findings of this study offer valuable insights for policy-makers concerned with promoting and protecting global democracy, which has faced increasing challenges despite a general post-WWII trend towards democratization. Notably, the “third wave” of democratization (Huntington 1991) witnessed a surge in democratic transitions in the late 20th century. Since the Cold War’s end, democratic nations have outnumbered non-democratic ones (Figure 1) with the gap widening.\n\nCodeREIGN |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1945 & year &lt; 2021) |&gt; \n  mutate(democracy = case_when(\n    gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"parliamentary\", \"presidential\") ~ \"Democracy\",\n    .default = \"Non-democracy\")) |&gt; \n  summarise(Count = n(), \n            .by = c(year, democracy)) |&gt; \n  #view()\n  ggplot(aes(year, Count, color = democracy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(color = 'Regime type',\n       x = \"Years: 1945 ~ 2020\",\n       y = \"No. of Countries\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    label = \"Data source: REIGN (Regime data)\",\n    x = 2010,\n    y = 30,\n    fontface = \"italic\",\n    size = 3\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the number of democratic and non-democratic countries (1945-2020)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a “democratic recession” has emerged in recent years (Diamond 2008). Freedom House reports an 18th consecutive year of global freedom decline in 2023 (House 2024). While few countries have completely regressed to autocracy, the average global democracy level has fallen back to pre-2000 levels. Notably, democratic backsliding often occurs within regimes, with democracies becoming less liberal and autocracies becoming less competitive (Mechkova, Lührmann, and Lindberg 2017).\nThis research highlights irregular power transitions as a significant factor in democratic backsliding within regimes. These transitions, often coups or autocoups, violate democratic norms and disrupt the path towards stable democracies. Leaders who gain power through irregular means often resort to undemocratic tactics to maintain control, creating a vicious cycle of eroding democratic institutions.\nOur findings suggest that the shorter lifespans and potentially severe consequences associated with coups may deter potential coup leaders. Conversely, autocoups appear to be a more tempting option for power-hungry leaders due to their higher success rates, seemingly moderate consequences, and extended leader tenure after the autocoup. This trend may explain the decline in classic coups since the 1990s alongside the rise of autocoups (Bermeo 2016).\n\n2.3 Limitations and directions for future research\nThis study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular power transitions, but some limitations require further exploration:\n\nData refinement: Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach. Future research should validate this classification system through additional studies and expert evaluations.\nData harmonization: The current analysis faces challenges due to mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for more robust comparisons.\nDemocratic backsliding: While this study establishes a connection between irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical evidence is needed to solidify this link.\n\nSeveral avenues exist for future research:\n\nTerminology and data collection: Refining the “autocoup” concept and achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive data collection.\nDataset expansion: Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.\nPower dynamics and long-term impacts: Utilizing this dataset, future studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems, particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization of power.\n\nIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the dynamics of irregular power transitions, specifically focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining autocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader longevity, we establish a framework for understanding irregular transitions and leader survival. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of democratic resilience and political stability. Future research can build upon this foundation by conducting further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup dataset and continuing to refine the framework.\n\n\n\n\nCan.Do.So\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the number of democratic and non-democratic countries (1945-2020)\n\n\n\nBaturo, Alexander, and Jakob Tolstrup. 2022. “Incumbent Takeovers.” Journal of Peace Research 60 (2): 373–86. https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433221075183.\n\n\nBermeo, Nancy. 2016. “On Democratic Backsliding.” Journal of Democracy 27 (1): 5–19. https://doi.org/10.1353/jod.2016.0012.\n\n\nCameron, Maxwell A. 1998. “Latin American Autogolpes : Dangerous Undertows in the Third Wave of Democratisation.” Third World Quarterly 19 (2): 219–39. https://doi.org/10.1080/01436599814433.\n\n\nChin, John J, David B Carter, and Joseph G Wright. 2021. “The Varieties of Coups D’état: Introducing the Colpus Dataset.” International Studies Quarterly 65 (4): 1040–51. https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqab058.\n\n\nDiamond, Larry. 2008.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Irregular power transitions, marked by a disregard for constitutional procedures, are a critical area of study in political science. They not only disrupt established rules but often require unconstitutional tactics to secure power. Furthermore, these transitions can inspire copycat behaviour among other ambitious leaders.\nDespite their central role in political science and the extensive research conducted on irregular power transitions, a long-standing question continues to intrigue political scientists: Why are some leaders ousted before their terms expire, while others complete their full terms or even overstay beyond their originally mandated limits? In other words, why do some leaders survive for decades while others last for only years, months, or even days? This dissertation focuses on this question and seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis, dedicated to understanding how leaders come to power through unconstitutional means and what factors determine the duration of a leader’s rule following an irregular ascent.\n\nWhen discussing irregular power transitions, the concepts that often come to mind are irregular entries or exits, such as coups, assassinations, rebellions, protests, and foreign interventions. Among these methods, coups hold a prominent position due to their frequent occurrence. According to the Archigos dataset (Goemans, Gleditsch, and Chiozza 2009), from 1945 to 2015, there were approximately 145 instances of irregular leader exits, with coups accounting for more than half (79 leaders). The often-cited coup dataset (Powell and Thyne 2011) records even more leaders (245 cases) removed by coups from 1950 to 2023.\nGiven their prevalence and substantial influence on political systems, coups have been extensively studied, particularly since 2000 (Thyne and Powell 2019). Consequently, the concept of a coup is comparatively clear and widely accepted in academic circles. Many scholars, including this study, follow the definition by Powell and Thyne (2011), which describes coups as “illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive… [a coup is successful] if the perpetrators seize and hold power for at least seven days” (p. 252). Although debates persist, two elements are clear: first, the perpetrators are elites within the ruling group, and the victims of coups are incumbent executive leaders. Second, the strategy or aim of a coup involves completely removing the incumbents, not merely seizing part of their power or forcing them to concede on specific policies. Beyond defining coups, several datasets have been developed for quantitative analyses, such as the Global Instances of Coups (Powell and Thyne 2011), the Cline Centre Coup d’État Project Dataset (Peyton et al. 2024), and the Colpus Dataset (Chin, Carter, and Wright 2021). These datasets are well-developed and frequently used in political science research.\nHowever, irregular power transitions are not limited to irregular entries and exits but should also include irregular “overstays.” Using illegal means to overthrow an incumbent leader before their term expires is undoubtedly an irregular power transition. Similarly, an incumbent using illegitimate means to extend their term beyond term limits is also an irregular power transition.\nAlthough academic attention to irregular retention of power has increased since the 1990s, especially after Peru’s President Alberto Fujimori’s self-coup in 1992, it remains comparatively understudied and has several shortcomings. First, there is no universally accepted terminology for this “overstaying in power” type of irregular power transition, unlike the clear term “coup.” Consequently, various terms such as self-coup, autogolpe, and executive coup are used by different scholars. This dissertation will use ‘autocoup’ to refer to this type of irregular power transition, which will be thoroughly discussed in Chapter 3. Second, there is no consensus on the definition of an autocoup. Existing definitions remain vague, often conflating power expansions and power extensions. For example, Cameron (1998) defines an autogolpe as a temporary suspension of the constitution and dissolution of Congress by the executive, who then rules by decree. This definition focuses on power expansion instead of power extension, leading to conceptual confusion and misalignment with the definition of a classic coup. Third, a consensus autocoup dataset is lacking. While several related datasets exist, as discussed by Baturo and Tolstrup (2022) in coding their Incumbent Takeover dataset, the terminologies, definitions, and coverage years vary, lacking wide acknowledgment and extensive academic exploration. In summary, autocoup has not been analysed in a comparative manner connected with coups.\nAnalysing coups and autocoups separately is less problematic. However, from a comprehensive framework perspective on irregular power transitions and leader survival, coups and autocoups should be, and can be, analysed within the same framework. Both coup and autocoup significantly influence democratic backsliding and are the most frequent means of irregular power transition. Furthermore, as both are called “coups,” classic coups and autocoups are very similar since a coup is launched to replace the current leader, while an autocoup is staged to replace the future leader.\n\nThis study addresses a critical gap in the literature by offering a comprehensive framework for analysing both coups and autocoups, which are the most common forms of irregular power transitions. While existing research often examines these topics separately with varying terminologies, definitions, methods, and datasets, this dissertation integrates these elements to provide a unified perspective on irregular power transitions and leader survival.\nOur contributions are threefold:\n\nEmphasis on power dynamics and regime types: We highlight the significant role of power dynamics, particularly the influence of regime types, in determining the success and frequency of coup attempts. Our analysis underscores how the expected chances of coup success motivate such attempts, with military regimes being notably susceptible.\nRefined definition and novel dataset for autocoups: We introduce a refined definition of autocoups and develop a novel dataset covering events from 1945 to 2022. This enables a comparative analysis with classic coups, providing clearer insights into the nature and impact of autocoups on political systems.\nSurvival analysis of leaders from different entry modes: By applying survival analysis to existing coup data and our new autocoup dataset, we demonstrate how different modes of entry into power significantly affect leader survival. Our findings reveal that leaders who come to power through coups typically have shorter tenures and face higher removal risks compared to those who extend their rule through autocoups.\n\nOur analysis of irregular power transitions is particularly relevant to understanding democratic backsliding. These transitions violate democratic norms and disrupt the path towards stable democracy. Leaders who gain power through irregular means often employ undemocratic tactics, such as suppressing opposition, to consolidate their illegitimate hold on power. This creates a vicious cycle where the erosion of democratic institutions is both a cause and consequence of efforts to maintain power.\n\nThis study is structured into three main chapters beyond the introduction, each addressing key aspects of irregular power transitions and their implications for political stability and democratic processes.\nChapter 2 examines the determinants of classic coup attempts. While extensive research exists on coups, most studies focus on observable factors such as economic performance, political stability, previous coups, and coup-proofing strategies. This chapter, however, emphasizes the less observable but crucial factor of expected coup success chances, which has been often overlooked. Utilizing Heckman’s two-staged sample selection model, the analysis reveals that expected success rates significantly influence coup attempts. These success rates are primarily shaped by the balance of power between incumbents and challengers, which is largely determined by regime types. The findings indicate that military regimes face a much higher risk of coups compared to dominant-party regimes.\nChapter 3 focuses on the concept of autocoups, specifically on power extensions by incumbent leaders. It distinguishes autocoups from broader concepts like self-coups or executive coups by redefining them as instances where incumbent leaders refuse to transition power as mandated, thereby overstaying in office. Based on this refined definition, a novel dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2022 is introduced, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successes. The chapter includes case studies and empirical analyses that demonstrate the utility of this dataset for quantitative research, providing a basis for empirical analysis on autocoups.\nChapter 4 investigates how the method of power acquisition impacts the longevity of leaders who come to power through coups versus those who extend their rule through autocoups. The hypothesis is that the method of accession significantly affects leader tenure. Using the Cox proportional hazards model and a time-dependent Cox model, the chapter provides evidence of differing survival times between these two types of leaders. The results indicate that leaders who come to power through coups face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to those who extend their rule through autocoups. This finding highlights the implications for political stability and democratic processes, suggesting that the relatively low cost and high returns of autocoups could incentivize incumbents to seize power in this manner, potentially leading to democratic backsliding and the personalization of power.\nIn Chapter 5, the study concludes by summarizing the main findings, discussing policy implications, and acknowledging the limitations of the research. It also outlines directions for future research, emphasizing the need for further exploration of irregular power transitions, particularly coups and autocoups."

    "text": "2 Conclusion\n\n2.1 Main Findings\nThis study delves into the dynamics and implications of irregular power transitions, focusing on coups and autocoups. The findings illuminate the complex interplay between incumbents and challengers fighting for power.\nFirstly, our analysis reveals that the expected success rate of a coup attempt significantly influences its likelihood. This success rate is heavily influenced by the balance of power between the incumbent regime and challengers, which is largely determined by regime type. We find that military regimes, although with more control over their own military forces, face a higher risk of coups compared to dominant-party regimes.\nSecondly, the study introduces a redefined concept: the autocoup. Defined as an incumbent leader’s refusal to relinquish power as mandated, this research distinguishes autocoups from broader terms like self-coups. Based on this definition, we present the first publicly available dataset of autocoup events from 1945 to 2022, encompassing 110 attempts and 87 successful autocoups. Case studies and empirical analyses demonstrate the dataset’s utility for quantitative research, providing a robust foundation for further analysis on autocoups.\nThirdly, employing survival analysis techniques, the study finds clear differences in leader longevity between those who come to power through coups and those who extend their rule through autocoups. The results indicate that coup-installed leaders face a significantly higher risk of removal compared to autocoup leaders who manipulate the system to extend their rule.\n\n2.2 Policy Implications\nThe findings of this study offer valuable insights for policy-makers concerned with promoting and protecting global democracy, which has faced increasing challenges despite a general post-WWII trend towards democratization. Notably, the “third wave” of democratization (Huntington 1991) witnessed a surge in democratic transitions in the late 20th century. Since the Cold War’s end, democratic nations have outnumbered non-democratic ones (Figure 1) with the gap widening.\n\nCodeREIGN |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt; 1945 & year &lt; 2021) |&gt; \n  mutate(democracy = case_when(\n    gwf_regimetype %in% c(\"parliamentary\", \"presidential\") ~ \"Democracy\",\n    .default = \"Non-democracy\")) |&gt; \n  summarise(Count = n(), \n            .by = c(year, democracy)) |&gt; \n  #view()\n  ggplot(aes(year, Count, color = democracy)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(color = 'Regime type',\n       x = \"Years: 1945 ~ 2020\",\n       y = \"No. of Countries\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    label = \"Data source: REIGN (Regime data)\",\n    x = 2010,\n    y = 30,\n    fontface = \"italic\",\n    size = 3\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the number of democratic and non-democratic countries (1945-2020)\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a “democratic recession” has emerged in recent years (Diamond 2008). Freedom House reports an 18th consecutive year of global freedom decline in 2023 (House 2024). While few countries have completely regressed to autocracy, the average global democracy level has fallen back to pre-2000 levels. Notably, democratic backsliding often occurs within regimes, with democracies becoming less liberal and autocracies becoming less competitive (Mechkova, Lührmann, and Lindberg 2017).\nThis research highlights irregular power transitions as a significant factor in democratic backsliding within regimes. These transitions, often coups or autocoups, violate democratic norms and disrupt the path towards stable democracies. Leaders who gain power through irregular means often resort to undemocratic tactics to maintain control, creating a vicious cycle of eroding democratic institutions.\nOur findings suggest that the shorter lifespans and potentially severe consequences associated with coups may deter potential coup leaders. Conversely, autocoups appear to be a more tempting option for power-hungry leaders due to their higher success rates, seemingly moderate consequences, and extended leader tenure after the autocoup. This trend may explain the decline in classic coups since the 1990s alongside the rise of autocoups (Bermeo 2016).\n\n2.3 Limitations and directions for future research\nThis study offers a novel framework for analysing irregular power transitions, but some limitations require further exploration:\n\nData refinement: Defining and classifying autocoups is a new approach. Future research should validate this classification system through additional studies and expert evaluations.\nData harmonization: The current analysis faces challenges due to mismatched units (country-year vs. leader) between coup and autocoup datasets. Future efforts should explore data harmonization techniques for more robust comparisons.\nDemocratic backsliding: While this study establishes a connection between irregular power transitions and democratic backsliding, further empirical evidence is needed to solidify this link.\n\nSeveral avenues exist for future research:\n\nTerminology and data collection: Refining the “autocoup” concept and achieving wider recognition will facilitate more accurate and comprehensive data collection.\nDataset expansion: Expanding the autocoup dataset with more cases and integrating it with data on other irregular leadership transitions can provide a more holistic view of political survival after these events.\nPower dynamics and long-term impacts: Utilizing this dataset, future studies can delve deeper into power dynamics at play and explore the long-term consequences of irregular transitions on political systems, particularly regarding democratic backsliding, breakdown, and personalization of power.\n\nIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the dynamics of irregular power transitions, specifically focusing on coups and autocoups. By redefining autocoups, classifying the dataset, analysing determinants, and comparing leader longevity, we establish a framework for understanding irregular transitions and leader survival. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of democratic resilience and political stability. Future research can build upon this foundation by conducting further empirical analyses based on the novel autocoup dataset and continuing to refine the framework.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the number of democratic and non-democratic countries (1945-2020)"

Let’s take a look at what we just produced:\n\nCodetibble(\n  files = list.files(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", recursive = TRUE),\n  size_MB = file.size(file.path(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\", files)) / 1024^2\n)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nOur single 9GB CSV file has been rewritten into 18 parquet files. The file names use a “self-describing” convention used by the Apache Hive project. Hive-style partitions name folders with a “key=value” convention, so as you might guess, the CheckoutYear=2005 directory contains all the data where CheckoutYear is 2005. Each file is between 100 and 300 MB and the total size is now around 4 GB, a little over half the size of the original CSV file. This is as we expect since parquet is a much more efficient format.\n\n4.2 Using dplyr with arrow\nNow we’ve created these parquet files, we’ll need to read them in again. We use open_dataset() again, but this time we give it a directory:\n\nCodeseattle_pq &lt;- open_dataset(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts\")\n\n\nNow we can write our dplyr pipeline. For example, we could count the total number of books checked out in each month for the last five years:\n\nCodequery &lt;- seattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear &gt;= 2018, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth)\n\n\nWriting dplyr code for arrow data is conceptually similar to dbplyr, Chapter 21: you write dplyr code, which is automatically transformed into a query that the Apache Arrow C++ library understands, which is then executed when you call collect(). If we print out the query object we can see a little information about what we expect Arrow to return when the execution takes place. And we can get the results by calling collect():\n\nCodequery\n\nFileSystemDataset (query)\nCheckoutYear: int32\nCheckoutMonth: int64\nTotalCheckouts: int64\n\n* Grouped by CheckoutYear\n* Sorted by CheckoutYear [asc], CheckoutMonth [asc]\nSee $.data for the source Arrow object\n\nCodequery |&gt; \n  collect()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nLet’s compare the time it took to count the Checkouts by year using the CSV file and the Parquet file and see if it worth the trouble.\n\nCodecsvtime &lt;- seattle_csv |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\ncsvtime\n\n   user  system elapsed \n 20.009   3.322  20.048 \n\n\n\nCodepqtime &lt;- seattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\npqtime\n\n   user  system elapsed \n  0.449   0.071   0.131 \n\n\nParquet file took 0.131 seconds while csv file took 20.048 seconds. The Parquet file is extremely faster, about 100 times, than the CSV file. Totally worth the trouble."

Patients were determined to be at high risk on the basis of validated patient- and procedure-related risk factors. The primary outcome was post-ERCP pancreatitis, which was defined as new upper abdominal pain, an elevation in pancreatic enzymes to at least three times the upper limit of the normal range 24 hours after the procedure, and hospitalization for at least 2 nights.\nRESULTS A total of 602 patients were enrolled and completed follow-up. The majority of patients (82%) had a clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Post-ERCP pancreatitis developed in 27 of 295 patients (9.2%) in the indomethacin group and in 52 of 307 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.005). Moderate-to-severe pancreatitis developed in 13 patients (4.4%) in the indomethacin group and in 27 patients (8.8%) in the placebo group (P=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, rectal indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of the condition.

You might ask. The answer is that duckdb is faster than R for large datasets. As showed above, the query in duckdb is much faster than in R to get the same results.\nWe might not notice a significant difference in query execution speed in this example because the dataset is small. However, the discrepancy becomes more apparent with larger datasets. Let’s examine a big dataset to observe the contrast in query execution speed. We’ll use a dataset containing item checkouts from Seattle public libraries, accessible online at Seattle.\nWhen attempting to read the dataset with read_csv(), it may encounter considerable processing delays or even fail outright. This is primarily due to the dataset’s substantial size, comprising approximately 41,389,465 rows, spanning 12 columns, and occupying 9.21 GB of storage space. The following code would fail to read such voluminous data.\n```{r}\nread_csv(\"~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv\") |&gt; \n  nrow()\n```\nLet’s try to query with duckdb.\n\nCodetic(\"sql\")\n\n\n\nCodeSelect Count(*)\nFrom read_csv('~/GitHub/data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv')\n\n\n1 records\n\ncount_star()\n\n\n41389465\n\n\n\n\n\nCodetoc()\n\nsql: 6.207 sec elapsed\n\n\nDuckDB took a bit longer to retrieve the results, more than 4 seconds, but the performance was quite acceptable. It outperformed R, which failed to read the data altogether."
