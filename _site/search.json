It is a huge dataset and it is almost impossible to view the whole V-Dem dataset in R. It would be better, although still quite slow, to use duckdb to query the dataset and view the outcome in R."

According to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC) dataset (Powell and Thyne 2011), Latin American countries such as Bolivia witnessed 23 coups between 1950 and 1984, while Argentina experienced 20 during a similar timeframe. However, Mexico’s authoritarian period from 1917 to 2000 saw no coups at all. In Africa, Sudan endured 17 coups between 1955 and 2021, whereas South Africa has not experienced a coup since 1950. Similar patterns are observed in the Middle East and South Asia. Despite numerous attempts in previous studies to explain these disparities, no consensus has been reached on a definitive model for analysing coups. As noted by Gassebner, Gutmann, and Voigt (2016), around one hundred potential determinants of coups have been proposed, yet the fundamental question remains unanswered.\nIn analysing the determinants of coups, it’s crucial not to overlook the most significant characteristic of coups themselves. Coups represent illegal attempts to overthrow current leaders, and the consequences of failed coups can be exceedingly high. Perpetrators of coups risk imprisonment, exile, or even death if their attempts are unsuccessful. In some instances, the repercussions extend to the families of the coup perpetrators. Despite these grave risks, there have been numerous coup attempts throughout history—according to the Global Instances of Coups (GIC) dataset, a total of 491 coups have been launched since 1950, with 245 coups succeeding. Furthermore, in 2021 alone, 7 coups occurred in 6 countries, marking the most frequent year for coup attempts since 2000.

Therefore, when considering a coup, plotters prioritize assessing their probability of success. While they may have various motivations for initiating a coup, they are unlikely to proceed without a reasonable expectation of success. When faced with low prospects of success, coup plotters may either abandon their plans or await more favorable circumstances. Determining the threshold for the likelihood of success is challenging, but historical data reveals that staged coups have generally enjoyed satisfactory success rates.

However, consensus remains elusive regarding why coups are more prevalent in certain countries while less so in others. Previous scholarship exploring the determinants of coup attempts has often overlooked the crucial aspect of coup success. Given the severe consequences of a failed coup, coup plotters are unlikely to proceed unless they perceive a high chance of success. Thus, the expected outcome of a coup—whether successful or unsuccessful—is not merely incidental but serves as a pivotal determinant of coup attempts. The decision to stage a coup is a self-selected variable contingent upon the anticipated success rate of coups. This study employs a sample selection model (specifically, a two-stage probit model) to elucidate why coups are more common in some autocratic countries but rare in others. I contend that coup attempts are largely shaped by the likelihood of coup success, which, in turn, hinges on the power dynamics between coup perpetrators and incumbents. These power dynamics are influenced by the regime type and their distinct responses to internal and external shocks. \n\n\n\n\n\nInvalid Date\n\n\nZhu Qi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoups and Democracy\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong patients at high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, rectal indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of the condition. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00820612. opens in new tab.) \n\n\n\n\n\nMar 30, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManuscript\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND Preliminary research suggests that rectally administered nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may reduce the incidence of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\nMETHODS In this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial, we assigned patients at elevated risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis to receive a single dose of rectal indomethacin or placebo immediately after ERCP. Patients were determined to be at high risk on the basis of validated patient- and procedure-related risk factors. The primary outcome was post-ERCP pancreatitis, which was defined as new upper abdominal pain, an elevation in pancreatic enzymes to at least three times the upper limit of the normal range 24 hours after the procedure, and hospitalization for at least 2 nights.\nRESULTS A total of 602 patients were enrolled and completed follow-up. The majority of patients (82%) had a clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Post-ERCP pancreatitis developed in 27 of 295 patients (9.2%) in the indomethacin group and in 52 of 307 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.005). Moderate-to-severe pancreatitis developed in 13 patients (4.4%) in the indomethacin group and in 27 patients (8.8%) in the placebo group (P=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS Among patients at high risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, rectal indomethacin significantly reduced the incidence of the condition.
